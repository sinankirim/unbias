Many of the homes belonged to pensioners and their jewellery had immense sentimental value to them. \nBoboic is a Polish citizen who would normally have been entitled to live in Britain under European Union freedom of movement rules. \nHe was deported because he has committed 23 offences since coming to Britain in 2008, including two previous house burglaries. \nHe returned illegally shortly before he started his eight month crime spree in July 2016. The first break-in was exactly a week before the Brexit referendum vote. \nHe broke into houses at Honiton, Ottery St Mary, West Hill, Budleigh Salterton, Exmouth, Okehampton, Mary Tavy and Tavistock. Date and location of the burglaries \nJune 2016 \nChineway Gardens, Ottery St Mary. \nJuly 2016 \nBunn Road, Exmouth (two houses). \nHalsdon Road, Exmouth. \nViolet Lane, Tavistock. \nPine Grove, Honiton \nBoboic, aged 25, of Park Croft, Polegate, East Sussex, admitted 15 burglaries and was jailed for three and a half years by Judge Erik Salomonsen at Exeter Crown Court. \nHe will start the sentence after he completes a six year term imposed at Lewes Crown Court for a robbery in Sussex in January. \nThe judge told him: \"Each an every one of these offences had a victim and each and every victim suffered loss. In many cases they lost items which simply could not be replaced because they had sentimental value. \n\"I have read the victim impact statements. These offences were against not only the public, but more particularly against occupiers who were frequently elderly. \n\"It has been suggested that on your visits to Devon, having hired a car and booked a hotel in advance, you simply decided to carry out these burglaries on a whim. I do not accept that.

Several victims were elderly and their losses were significant. \n\"At one property jewellery worth £30,000 was stolen and many of the items were of great sentimental value. Many had been handed down through families. The total loss is in excess of £100,000. \n\"In many of these burglaries there was greater harm because of the significant degree of loss. There was also significant planning and organisation involving the booking of hotels and hiring of cars.

None of the jewellery has been recovered. \nMiss Francesca Whebell, said Boboic is a former Brighton bus driver with a partner and four-year-old son living in Sussex. \nHe was deported back to Poland because of the earlier offences but his entire family live in Britain and he did not want to be separated from them. \nHe came back and started committing the crimes on an opportunistic basis while staying in Devon to avoid being picked up by the immigration authorities, who were looking for him in Sussex.

He went to Devon or Cornwall to avoid the immigration authorities. \n\"He appealed against his deportation but when he lost the appeal his life spiralled out of control Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-11-28T14:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-11-28T14:41:40.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
