He said: “There’s a very strong right wing view in American that universities are ‘indoctrination factories’.” Read More \nProf Brooks described the phenomenon as “culture wars” and added: “It’s said when the US sneezes the world catches a cold. I’m worried that the culture war is being transferred here.” \nWe contacted for the Department for Education for comment.
