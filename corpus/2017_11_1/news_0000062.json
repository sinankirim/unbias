What does this mean for the average consumer? \nSavings \nCharlotte Nelson , Finance Expert at moneyfacts.co.uk , said: \n“Today’s rate decision may see some savers jump for joy, as it marks the first positive base rate move in more than 10 years. However, savers may want to hold back on the celebration, since the link between base rate and savings rates seems to be severed. \n“Savers have struggled to find a decent return with rates at rock-bottom. For example, the average easy access account stands at 0.39% today, while back in July 2007 (the last time base rate rose) it stood at a whopping 4.05%. Savings rates have finally taken a positive turn over the past year, with challenger banks stepping in to offer savers some sort of return. As a result, the average two-year fixed rate has risen from 1.09% a year ago to 1.44% today. \n“Given it’s been such a long time since the market has seen a base rate rise, it is very difficult to tell whether providers will increase their rates straight away or decide to wait and see what the rest of the market does before making their move. Anyone looking for a savings deal now will need to keep on their toes and check the Best Buys to ensure they are still getting the best rate.” \nMortgages \nCharlotte Nelson , Finance Expert at moneyfacts.co.uk , said: \n“Competition in the mortgage market has remained high and borrowers have experienced some of the lowest rates on record. However, the speculation prior to today’s base rate rise has been causing rates to slowly creep up since September and so today’s announcement may see an end to the lowest of deals. \n“Lenders have been keen to attract the attention of borrowers to protect their mortgage book in case of a rate rise, which is one of the main reasons both the cost and availability of deals has improved. Indeed, the number of mortgage deals has now increased to 4,748 from 4,151 in just one year. \n“The last time the markets saw a base rate rise, in July 2007, the average two-year fixed rate stood at 6.24%, whereas today the rate is significantly lower, sitting at 2.33%. Over the same period the SVR has fallen from 7.41% to 4.60% today. \n“This rate increase will have a significant impact on those currently on their Standard Variable Rate (SVR). Based on the average SVR of 4.60%, today’s rate rise represents an increase of £28.72* to monthly repayments. However, with fixed rate mortgages still low, borrowers will be significantly better off switching deals now before it may be too late.” \n*Based on a £200,000 mortgage over a 25-year term on a repayment-only basis. \nPensions \nRichard Eagling , Head of Pensions at moneyfacts.co.uk , said: \n“The interest rate rise is good news for those on the verge of retirement who may be looking to secure an income through an annuity, as it’s likely to boost gilt yields, which underpin annuity rates. Although gilt yields have started to increase in recent weeks, they remain low on a historic basis and the increases have yet to fully feed through to annuity rates. \n“A significant boost in annuity rates is long overdue, with annuity income having fallen every year since 2014. It will be interesting to see whether any rise in annuity income encourages more retirees to consider the merits of an annuity rather than simply opting for drawdown.” \n.255. �7PP�D 12:07 Reaction to interest rate rise \nThe Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has increased rates to 0.5%. The MPC had cut the base interest rate to an historic low of 0.25% in August 2016, two months after the EU referendum. \nThe National Federation of Builders (NFB) believes that this decision will help construction SMEs chase late payments across their supply chains. The Late Payment of Commercial Debts Regulations of 2013 allows companies that are owed payments to charge interest at 8% of the debt plus the Bank of England’s base rate. \nRichard Beresford, chief executive of the NFB, said: “The interest rate rise will give SMEs more leverage when chasing late payments, but there is still some way to go. When the Bank of England previously cut interest rate in 2016, we asked the Government to increase efforts to tackle late payment more aggressively. Construction continues to have the worst payment record of any industrial sector, with SMEs owed more than £30 billion in unpaid invoices. \nBeresford continued: “SMEs make up for more than 99% of the construction industry. This is an opportunity for SMEs to test the small business commissioner who can deal with late payment claims, confidentially if required.” 12:04 First interest rate rise in a decade \nThe Bank of England raised interest rates to 0.5% from 0.25%, marking the first increase since July 2007. 11:02 Crash in Exeter at Wonford 09:56 Woman 'allowed to starve herself to death' says damning new report \nA new report details how a 40-year-old Devon woman was allowed to starve to death when she was supposed to be under the care of mental health services. \nRuth Mitchell was found dead by police officers at her home in 2012 after a neighbour raised concerns about her. \nShe had starved herself to death and her gas had been cut off, meetings with health care professionals had been missed. 09:44 Traffic returning to normal on the A380 at Torquay \nThe broken-down Smart car has been removed from the Newton Abbot-bound section of the A380 South Devon Highway, and traffic is moving freely. \nRecovery is still under way from the earlier crash, which happened in the junction at the bottom of Hamelin Way. \nThree vehicles heading into the junction from the Newton Abbot direction, in the lane turning up the hill towards Marldon, appeared to have run into each other. Police and ambulance were at the scene earlier. \nA recovery vehicle is currently at the scene, and traffic is moving freely around the area of the crash. 09:36 Woman killed by hit-and-run driver Jonathan Kane \nA hit and run driver who killed a woman while driving to catch his flight to Germany made no attempt to brake before the crash, a court has heard. \nCatherine Bailey was hit so hard she was instantly killed, being thrown 18 metres into a ditch with 14 broken ribs and a severed spine. \nThe Land Rover was left badly damaged in the crash, but Jonathan Kane kept driving in a bid to get home - eventually leaving his car a station in Exeter.
