Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThe whole of the North East has been urged to embrace the Government’s policy of creating powerful elected regional mayors . \nThere are set to be two mayors in the North East, following Chancellor Phillip Hammond’s Budget last week - the Tees Valley mayor, serving Darlington, Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Redcar and Cleveland and Stockton, and the new North of Tyne Mayor, serving North Tyneside , Northumberland and Newcastle. \nBut that leaves Durham, Gateshead, South Tyneside and Sunderland without a mayor. \nAnd the Government is giving priority to areas with elected regional mayors, also know as metro mayors - while places without them are sent to the back of the queue. \nLeading think tank, the Centre for Cities, said the areas left out in the cold should unite with the “North of Tyne” to become part of a Newcastle City Region. \nAndrew Carter, Chief Executive of Centre for Cities, said: “The metro mayors and their city regions are the clear winners of this Budget.” Read More The North of Tyne region announces multi-million pound devolution deal \nHe added: “This shows that mayoral city regions will be given priority ahead of other places when it comes to Government decisions on investment and policy-making. If any other cities had doubts about the merits of having a mayor, this Budget should put those misgivings to bed. \n“Major cities which are yet to introduce a mayor should therefore step up efforts to agree a devolution deal with the Government, or risk falling further behind.” \nAnd he said; “Hopefully the North of Tyne deal will be a stepping stone towards a wider Newcastle city region deal that includes areas like Gateshead, which make up an integral part of the local economy.” Nick Forbes, leader of Newcastle City Council, Norma Redfearn, directly-elected Mayor of North Tyneside and Councillor Peter Alan Jackson, leader of Northumberland Council (Image: Newcastle Chronicle) \nCouncillors in the Durham, Gateshead, South Tyneside and Sunderland authorities may be reluctant to adopt mayoral model, and previous attempts to create a “North East” mayor failed because the councils were reluctant to press ahead. \nMany Labour MPs in the region are also hostile to the Government’s mayor policy, and the Labour front bench has promised to treat every region equally whether it has a mayor or not if they form a future government. \nBut the present Government openly favours areas with mayors. \nThe mayor-led North of Tyne Combined Authority will get £600 million over 30 years while the Tees Valley is receiving £450 million over the same period. \nChancellor Phillip Hammond announced a £1.7 billion transport fund, with half the money going automatically to regions with mayors - while other places have to submit bids and compete for what’s left. Read More When is the election for the new North of Tyne Mayor? Here are all the key devolution dates \nMr Hammond announced £74 million would go to Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, £243 million for Greater Manchester, £134 million for Liverpool City Region, £80 million for West of England, £250 million for West Midlands and £59 million for Tees Valley, all regions with mayors in place. \nHe also announced that the West Midlands, Manchester and Liverpool would share £28 million to reduce homelessness. \nMeanwhile, the mayors themselves have joined forces to influence government policy on key issues such as Brexit - leaving other areas in the cold. \nAlong with London Mayor Sadiq Khan they met in the capital at the end of October to issue a united call for the Government to give them far more freedom and the ability to raise their own funding. \nTaking part were London Mayor Sadiq Khan, Andy Burnham (Greater Manchester), Tim Bowles (West of England), Ben Houchen (Tees Valley), James Palmer (Cambridgeshire and Peterborough), Steve Rotheram (Liverpool City Region) and Andy Street (West Midlands). \nA North of Tyne Mayor will eventually be invited to attend similar gatherings. \nElections for the new Mayor of the North of Tyne region will take place in May 2019. \nAn interim mayor will be appointed in summer 2018 until those elections take place.
