It’s a great honour to have so many key players coming together to recognise just that and seek out how to do even better in the future. \n“The North East has so much to offer investors from home and overseas, so there is no reason for us to be shy, we should be shouting loudly about our achievements and strengths.” Sarah Glendinning, director, CBI North East \nThe conferece is taking place at the Crowne Plaza on Newcastle’s Stephenson Quarter on November 13, with a keynote address by Koji Tsuruoka, the Japanese ambassador to the UK, whose country is a major investor in the North East through companies like Nissan, Hitachi and Komatsu. \nDelegates will be given an insight into trade in foreign markets with experts from India, Mexico, Australia and the United Arab Emirates taking part in a panel discussion. \nAnd small business owners Raman Sehgal, of Newcastle’s Ramarketing, and Sarat Pediredla, at hedgehog lab, will share their experiences of building up overseas trade. \nThe importance of overseas trade is becoming a growing focus for many firms as the country prepares for Brexit. \nIn 2012, then Chancellor George Osborne set the country a target of doubling UK exports to £1trn by 2020, though it is now widely thought that target will not be reached and there has been a recognition among Ministers that the UK is punching below its weight when it comes to overseas trade. \nA smaller proportion of UK businesses export than their counterparts in France and Germany, while half of UK companies that start exporting goods or services give up within six years. \nTwo senior officials from the Department for International Trade will be at the Newcastle conference to discuss “why exporting is vital to the future of the UK”.
