Number plate recognition systems, IoT tags and GPS data could confirm container units are tracked and that they are associated with the correct unit. IoT-connected temperature gauges and CO2 detectors could provide data on the condition of perishable goods. \nOnce checked by customs, real-time data transfers would allow authorised traders to speed unimpeded through a border control ‘blue lane’. \nBut tapping into these technological solutions to overcome trade barriers will also result in the collection of significant volumes of commercially sensitive and personal data; therefore data law compliance will be also crucial. \nThe EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) comes into operation on May 25, 2018, and post-Brexit, the UK’s Data Protection Bill will replicate its key features. \nThis legislation sits uneasily with the advancements that could underpin any IoT-connected border solution if the technology which replicates data to each participating computer within the network captures personal data. \nThere is a risk this may breach the GDPR unless specific legislative protection is provided. \nManufacturers would need to consider these compliance issues when implementing these new systems. \nManufacturers must also be confident about the security of any such system before committing commercially sensitive data. While Blockchain is touted as secure, the ‘DAO hack’ of June 2016 and subsequent breaches of Blockchain security have demonstrated that vulnerabilities exist. \nIn addition, unsecured or inadequately secured IoT devices may be hijacked to launch cyber-attacks capable of bringing down major organisations. \nGDPR compliance is a significant tool to help counter this cyber threat to help make those IoT devices which handle personal data more secure. \nTime is running out, and manufacturers should consider the risks and engage in the process of designing and implementing a system capable of meeting this post-Brexit challenge. \nThe IoT may just be the answer.
