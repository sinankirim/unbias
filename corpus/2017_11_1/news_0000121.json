The Metro system and the carriages are out of date. It is always breaking down so nothing but only good can come from it.” Read More How social media reacted \nAlan Hughes, 65, from Newcastle, said: “The trains have been fantastic over the years. I came to the region when it first opened and it has been marvellous as far as traffic is concerned. \n“It is the same with the shops. If the Metro is not running then there is a lot of problems so I think [the investment] is fantastic for the region.” \nBut Paul Fletcher, 61, disagreed and said that he did not think the cash would make much difference. \n“They want to improve the signalling because that is where all the problems are caused,” he said. \n“If they replaced that then it would not cost £337m. The trains are running fine and it is the signalling that they want to get sorted out.” Read More New Metros on track for North East: So when are they coming to a station near you? \nMr Hammond also announced that stamp duty would be abolished for most first-time buyers in England and Wales. \nThe change, effective immediately, will apply to the first £300,000 of a home’s value, saving first-time buyers £5,000. \nBlake Fletcher, 28, from Wideopen, said: “I think it is a good thing that they’ve scrapped it because no-one really knew what it was for. \n“However, I have just missed out because I’m a first-time buyer. It doesn’t really help me but it is great for future buyers.” \nMeanwhile, Mr Hammond said £3bn would be spent on Brexit planning and that the Government would prepare for “every possible outcome”.

They know what they are doing I think. \n“Maybe it will be difficult for people who import from Europe. There is no point in paying money to Europe, it is not helping anybody. Look at Eastern Europe, they are doing nothing for Eastern Europe.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-11-22T20:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-11-22T21:09:29.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
