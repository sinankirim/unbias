It is the final step on the journey to becoming a British citizen. \nThe ceremony must be attended within 90 days of approval being given if the applicant is over 18 and living in Britain. Otherwise, they may have to make a new application. \nWhile the South West data provided by the Home Office is for all foreigners applying for British citizenship - not just those from the EU - the rise appears to be driven by Europeans who could be affected by new immigration rules after Brexit. \nNationally, the proportion of people applying for British citizenship who are from the EU has increased from less than a third to nearly half. \nSome 67,580 of the 135,912 people who applied for British citizenship in the 12 months to September this year were from Europe. \nThat compares to 44,554 people out of the 147,137 who applied the previous year.

Some EU countries do not allow dual citizenship and the Home Office currently rejects a third of applications for Permanent Residence - the prerequisite for citizenship.

We reject the current proposal of 'settled status' which would not fully guarantee those rights and have proposed an alternative.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-11-11T17:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-11-11T17:58:37.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
