The Open University (4.55) and Nottingham Trent University (4.55) also fared well. \n“The life of today’s student goes far beyond the lecture hall”, said Owen O’Neill, founder of University Compare. \n“Prospective students must ensure they choose the city and university that is right for them. Not just academically, but socially, geographically and culturally. All of these factors have a telling influence on a student’s ability to settle in, perform well in the classroom and ultimately enjoy their experience.” Read More \nUniversity Compare uses the Trip Advisor model, inviting written reviews to help prospective students identify the right university and course based on genuine reviews from current and recently graduated students.
