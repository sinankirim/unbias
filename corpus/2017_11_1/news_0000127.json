It has all the toys I need and more \nQ – What should Theresa May do next? \nA – It’s too late to resign, so think things through very carefully, listen to real people and please provide leadership. Our country needs it \nQ – What do you make of people being caught out using offshore tax avoidance schemes – honest use of the rules or swindling the taxman and leaving the rest of us to pay? \nA – If it’s not illegal and rules aren’t broken, then it is what it is Even the Queen found herself included in the Paradise Papers - listing wealthy people with offshore investments (Image: Chris Gordon) \nQ – Leicester was recently announced as one of the best places to live in a PwC survey – what are its best points?
