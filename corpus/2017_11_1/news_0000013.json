That’s right, the working class from Sunderland to South Wales had all got the memo from Putin and duly obliged. And if Russia fixed it, she must have some fixers right?\" \nA strong opponent of the UK's decision to leave the EU, Mr Bradshaw asked Theresa May at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday: \"With today's news that the Electoral Commission is investigating Arron Banks, the main financial backer of Brexit, along with the significant British connections being uncovered by the American Justice Department's special counsel Robert Mueller, investigating Russian interference in the US presidential election, will you assure me that the UK Government and all its agencies are co-operating fully with the Mueller investigation or will do so if asked?\" \nArron Banks, the biggest financial backer of the campaign to leave the EU, launched Westmonster following the Brexit vote. The website says it aims to 'funnel the different people who backed Brexit into one place'.
