Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nDevon MP Sarah Wollaston has branded a campaign of intimidation against her as “misleading and very toxic”. \nDr Wollaston, the MP for Totnes, has been targeted by Brexit extremists since she was dubbed a “mutineer” by the Daily Telegraph. \nShe said yesterday that she would not be intimidated by the “wall of aggression”. \nDr Wollaston was one of 15 Conservative MPs who privately expressed concerns to the Conservative Party Whips’ office about the Prime Minister’s plan to set in stone the date Britain leaves the EU, regardless of the state of trade negotiations. \nThe Daily Mail followed up with an attack on the MPs, and they were also targeted on social media by a paid-for advertising campaign. The misleading Daily Telegraph front page \nThe adverts were posted by a murky Florida-registered organisation calling itself “Brexit Realities”. The group has been linked on social media to a former Vote Leave campaigner Thomas Borwick and his lobbying company Voter Consultancy Ltd. \nWe have left a message for Mr Borwick to get in touch to explain the campaign, but have not heard back. \nDr Wollaston said that, as a result of the campaign, her office had inundated by “a wall of aggressive correspondence”. \n“I voted Remain, but have always said I would respect the result of the referendum,” she said. “I think it’s right that MPs should express any concerns they have. \n“I did privately express my concerns about setting a hard date, which wasn’t in the original Brexit Bill.” \nShe said negotiations sometimes go to the wire, and that “setting a hard date runs the risk that at the 11th hour we will need emergency legislation to repeal it”.

If you are not prepared as an MP to scrutinise legislation, there is no point being here. \nShe said that, unlike fellow MP Anna Soubry, she has not had death threats, but added: “My team has had to deal with a wall of aggressive correspondence. \n“But I refuse to be intimidated. As a colleague said, if you climb high mountains, expect high winds.” \nDr Wollaston said she would also oppose so-called Henry VIII powers for ministers after Brexit. The government has said it wants to be able to amend legislation introduced to replace EU laws, without consulting Parliament.
