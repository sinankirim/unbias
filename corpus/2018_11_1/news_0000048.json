Matthew Williams, chief executive of Topps Tiles in their Enderby headquarters.\n“The plan is to focus on the top 100 key selling items, probably bringing in five to six weeks cover on those lines in the event that there is any short-term disruption.”\nTopps Tiles chief executive Matt Williams said there was less concern over staff from Europe having difficulties staying in the UK and he didn’t expect consumer confidence to get worse, having already taken a hit following the actual 2016 referendum.\nMr Williams said: “I think the consumer is remarkably resilient but we are confident that we are going to continue to outperform the market.\n“We are really keen to continue to move the retail business forward, putting digital at the centre of what we are doing as it becomes even more important for customers, so that by the time they make it to one of our stores they are committed to shopping with us.” Read More ", "external_links": ["https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/leicestermercury/subscriptions/&quot;}", "https://communicatoremail.com/IN/DCF/Ad9Bw6ZcmPSmMwDi7On4yR/"], "published": "2018-11-27T16:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-11-27T17:36:37.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
