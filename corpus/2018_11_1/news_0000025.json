Will increase your chance of being seen and reduce my risk of deploying my pen (and getting wet!!) Thanks Sgt B.\" Read More How to drive safely in gale force winds and during a rain storm\nThe constabulary's main twitter account also shared the advice, and said: \"Advice from very experienced roads policing officer Sgt B here: PUT YOUR LIGHTS ON. In case you hadn't noticed, the weather is filthy and visibility is poor. Thank you.\"\nThe best advice to drivers facing hazardous conditions is 'don't travel unless you have to' - but that isn't always an option. If you have little choice but to get behind the wheel and brave the roads, here is some more expert advice on how to drive as safely as possible. How to drive in Heavy Ran\nThe RAC says: Firstly, slow down! Reduce your speed and leave more space between you and the vehicle in front as stopping distances in rain are increased Use dipped headlights so that other drivers can see you more easily Don’t use rear fog lights. They can mask your brake lights and dazzle drivers behind you Look out for large or fast-moving vehicles creating spray which reduces visibility Also remember to keep your air conditioning on, as this will stop your windows from misting up - furthermore, you can read our full advice page on how to demist your windscreen in double-quick time Listen out for local news bulletins to keep up-to-date with road closures, flooding and forecasts If you break down in torrential rain keep the bonnet closed while waiting for help to arrive, to avoid the electrical system getting soaked Read More The seven 'drive clever' tips all motorists should know Driving too fast through standing water could lead to tyres losing contact with the road. If your steering suddenly feels light you could be aquaplaning. To regain grip, ease off the accelerator, do not brake and allow your speed to reduce until you gain full control of the steering again Driving fast through deep water can cause serious and expensive damage Be considerate to other road users and try not to spray pedestrians and cyclists as you drive through water Watch for winds.\nAn RAC spokesperson, Pete Williams, told the BBC that speed is important when coping with strong winds. \"High winds can get under a car and affect its handling and braking significantly,\" said Pete. Read More\nGiven how inconsistent strong winds are, drivers should hold the steering wheel firmly to avoid being caught off guard. Don't oversteer.\nIn stormy weather it can be easy to panic and overcompensate by oversteering - but this may get you into more difficulty.\nRemember you're driving on a slippery surface , so slow down significantly and \"ride it out\". If you sense a loss of friction or feel no resistance to steering inputs, it means you're probably aquaplaning. In these instances it's important to be aware of your surroundings, to have an idea about the depth of the water, type of road and to know your tire design and the air pressure. Above all remember, the faster you go, the greater your risk.

If we never had rain, snow, mud, or gravel on roads, tyres would all look like racing slicks, to deliver the most efficient traction. But the sculpture is carefully developed to best displace water, pack the snow, or eject the mud.\" Read More Police issue urgent warning and advice after 'fake' mobile phone charger starts huge fire\nCheck the tread depth regularly. You can do this by taking a 20p coin and sticking it in the one of the grooves on your tyre that seems low. If the outer band of your 20p piece stays in the groove, your tyres' treads are okay. Use the right lights\nWilliam Van Tassel, manager of driver training programmes at the American Automobiles Association , a US-based federation of motor clubs explains:\n\"Rule of thumb. Turn on your lights every time you drive. This way, you become twice as visible to other road users.\" Read More Brexit is good news for Euromillions Lottery players but only if you win the jackpot\nMake sure you dim high beams for approaching traffic and when following other vehicles, Van Tassel says, and low beams are for both fog and heavy rain. This is because the light from your high beams will reflect off the water droplets in the fog, decreasing your visibility. Go slow.\nStorms are the perfect conditions for aquaplaning (also called hydroplaning) owing to large amounts of standing water in the roads. This is when a car’s tyres \"float\" across standing water, resulting in both a loss of traction and control. By more monitoring your speed you will help keep tyres firmly planted.

That same puddle at 20mph would just be a splash.\" Keep a good distance.\nThe RAC also advise increasing the distance where possible between you and car in front. Increasing the two-second rule to four seconds, for example — that is, a four-second safety buffer between cars, which affords more time to avoid a collision.\nThis is also applies to lorries, buses, and motorcycles. \"They get blown easily by side winds,\" Williams says. And don't try getting ahead of tall vehicles like lorries: \"Driving past large vehicles can result in a sudden gust from the side as you clear.\" How to drive through flooding and deep puddles\nDriving through deep standing water incorrectly could cause serious damage to your car not to mention cost an extortionate amount to repair. The https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/advice/winter-driving/driving-in-heavy-rain/RAC suggests: Size up the puddle first – even if it means you have to stop your car and get out (getting a bit wet is a lot better than being left stranded). If the water is muddy you might not be able to see the bottom and gauge its depth. Try and find a stick or an object to find the lowest point. If it’s clearly too deep for your car, find another way to your destination. Modern vehicles’ door seals are good and keep water out, but this can make a car buoyant, meaning it could begin to float if the water gets to deep leaving you stranded. Even in this instance the water will eventually find its way in. If the puddle is shallow enough to drive through, try and spot any objects that may cause damage to your car’s wheels, tyres or suspension, potentially leaving you mid-puddle with a problem. This way you can pick a safe path across. Read More Glitter Gravy is now a thing this Christmas - and here's how you make it Once you’ve confirmed you can drive through the puddle and determined your route, keep your vehicle in a low gear (second is generally adequate) and engine revs up. This will help you maintain momentum when you travel through the puddle, creating a bow wave so you don’t get bogged down. Once you exit the other side – and especially if the puddle is on the deep side – pause for a moment if you can to let any excess water drain away and flow back to where it came from. If you can’t, be aware that grip levels on the road ahead will be diminished, as fluid from the puddle is dropped along the Tarmac by other cars. It’s always worthwhile to gently brush your brake pedal on exit, creating some friction and therefore heat to evaporate off any excess moisture. Some luxury vehicles can sense when you’ve navigated a puddle and automatically do this for you, keeping braking performance as effective as possible.\nAbove all, be careful. Don't take risks.\nFurther information can be found on the AA website .
