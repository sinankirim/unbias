Admission is free.\nThe film follows a group of different farmers and food producers through 2016.\nAiming to bring back the worm to the soil, the ‘culture’ to agriculture and the flavour to vegetables, their stories show that the future of farming is still – literally – in our hands.\nThe film is made by the Landworkers Alliance, a grassroots organization representing farmers, growers and land based workers in UK. They believe that we can produce nutritious food for all whilst making sure that farmers earn a good living and look after the soil and biodiversity.\n“This film is as inspiring and positive as it is down-to-earth” said Gill Westcott, Co-ordinator of Mid Devon Green Party.\n“It’s also only an hour so we’ll be able to discuss how food growers and the countryside in Devon will be affected by Brexit and by new legislation.”\nWith the uncertainty over a Brexit deal, concern for food security, threats to bees and other pollinators, and the challenge of climate change, there will be plenty to talk about.\nThe film trailer can be seen at https://inourhands.film/\nFurther information; phone 01647 24789 or email gillwestcott@gmail.com Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-11-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-11-19T14:34:32.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
