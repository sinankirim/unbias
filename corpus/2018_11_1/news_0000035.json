The UK television rights were valued at around £670m when he joined, and the last deal was worth £5.14bn.\nUnited are one of 20 clubs asked to provide £250,000 towards the golden handshake deal - although it was reported on Tuesday evening that the Premier League meeting broke up without an agreement on it. Newcastle may be one of the clubs reported to be uneasy with the idea, even if it is expected to pass.

Others suggested the money would be better provided to grassroots football or charity - especially considering Scudamore’s annual salary is reported to be £250,000.\nMeanwhile the Premier League confirmed Susanna Dinnage will replace Scudamore.
