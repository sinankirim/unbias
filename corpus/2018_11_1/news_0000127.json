Mr Cole, who is chief constable for Leicestershire, said 12% of crimes faced by his force were retail-related.\nIn the US, most filling stations require customers to pay for fuel at the pump by inserting a credit or debit card. However, this system has been blamed for lower profits, becuuase fewer people visit the convenience stores usually found on the forecourts.\nAnd the Petrol Retailers' Association has said switching to payment-at-the-pump would be \"prohibitively expensive\".\n\"The petroleum industry could design out bilking in 30 seconds by making people pay up front, which is what they do in other countries,\"said Chief Constable Cole, in an interview with the Telegraph newspaper.\n\"They don't, because the walk in their shops is part of their business offer.\" Read More Remainers claim Brexit is a threat to our beloved Cornish pasty\nHowever, the Petrol Retailers' Association commercial manager, Gordon Balmer, said it would cost at least Â£20,000 to retrofit petrol pumps at an average filling station to take card payments - while some estimates put the cost much higher.\nHe s that 50% of the average forecourt's profits now came from non-fuel sales, especially in rural communities, which had lost amenities such as banks and post offices.\n\"Many of those services have migrated into the store of a petrol station,\" he said.\nMr Balmer said 70% of the UK's filling stations were actually independently owned, but many people falsely believe petrol stations are run by big oil companies.
