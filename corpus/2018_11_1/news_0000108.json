New Look Men closure\nPrimark is going against the tide with figures showing a rise in its share of High Street shoppers.

The new Look in Torquay is one of the town's biggest shops (Image: Geograph)\nDiscussions are ongoing regarding a further 13 stores, of which Mr McGeorge said around half were likely to close.\nThe company’s new strategy has so far yielded higher profits, but sales continue to decline. Five reasons High Streets are struggling\nWe asked Lucinda Coleman, Business Recovery Partner at PKF Francis Clark and an expert in helping struggling retailers to find ways of restructuring their business to ride out the storm, to explain why the High Street has buckled under pressure.\n1. Tight wallets\nConsumer spending has had its weakest start to the year since 2012 seeing consumer spending falling -1.1% year – on- year, declining for the ninth time in ten months; face to face spend down -2.5% year- on- year and recreation and culture spending seeing its greatest decline since April 2010, according to the Visa UK Consumer Spending Index.\nIt is a stark reminder of just how tough it is for consumer-facing businesses.\n2. Rising labour costs and business rates\nRetailers and restaurants are facing a combination of costs such as the National Living Wage, Apprenticeship Levy and business rates, together with reduced consumer spending.\nMany businesses are reluctant to pass on growing costs to their customers in the form of price rises but that eats into profits.\n3. Narrow margins\nSmall and medium sized businesses operate on tighter budgets so they are likely to either lose money or raise prices which could result in a loss of custom. These tight margins and fragile finances show just how big the threat of insolvency will be in this sector.\n4. Cost of ingredients\nAs the value of sterling has fallen, it has pushed up the price of imported goods including the price of food that we import. The UK imports around 50% of its food so many restaurants rely heavily on food and wine imports. With the cost of importing ingredients now higher and the increase in the cost of labour, due to the national minimum wage rises the sector is facing the perfect storm.\n5. Competition\nThe restaurant sector is fiercely competitive with so much choice available. The rapid shift towards online shopping and meal delivery services has also taken a severe toll.\nNow, when diners do venture out for a meal with their tightened purses the restaurant needs to do something to entice the customer into their establishment.\nFigures released on Tuesday show that the company posted an underlying operating profit of £22.2 million for the first half, compared to a loss of £10.4 million in the same period last year.\nBut revenue declined by 4.2% to £656.9 million. Like-for-like sales under the New Look brand dropped by 3.7%, a slower rate than last year’s 8.6% drop.\nThe high-street mainstay said the slide in sales was in line with its plan to improve profitability with more full-price sales.\nSpeaking to the Press Association, Mr McGeorge said the first part of the recovery was going well, but that he would like to “move faster”.\n“We’re not looking to defend our position, we’re looking to attack,” he said.\nIn addition to the restructuring of its UK base, New Look last month announced its decision to exit its retail business in China, where it has 148 stores.
