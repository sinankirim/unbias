Others include Bridget Phillipson, Labour MP for Houghton and Sunderland South, Catherine McKinnell, MP for Newcastle North, Phil Wilson, MP for Sedgefield and Julie Elliott, MP for Sunderland Central.\nAll are Labour MPs, but their position goes slightly further than official Labour policy, which is to keep the option of a second referendum “on the table” if Theresa May’s planned deal falls, and if there is no general election. Prime Minister Theresa May speaks at a press conference after attending a special session of the European Council over Brexit on November 25, 2018 in Brussels, Belgium\nThe Prime Minister received a largely hostile reception as she told the House of Commons her Brexit deal “delivers for the British people”, and warned that rejecting it would put the UK on the path to division and uncertainty.\nShe was loudly barracked by MPs as she insisted that no better deal was available than the Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration on future relations endorsed by EU leaders in Brussels on Sunday.\nMrs May insisted: “This is the right deal for Britain because it delivers on the democratic decision of the British people.\n“It takes back control of our borders. It ends the free movement of people in full once and for all, allowing the government to introduce a new skills-based immigration system.\n“It takes back control of our laws. It ends the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK and means instead our laws being made in our Parliaments, enforced by our courts.\n“And it takes back control of our money. It ends the vast annual payments we send to Brussels.” Read More\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn urged MPs to “reject this terrible deal” and claimed Labour would negotiate “a sensible deal ... based on a comprehensive customs union and strong single market deal that protects rights at work and environmental safeguards.”\nHowever, Theresa May also faced an onslaught of hostile questions from former Conservative Cabinet ministers.\nTory former defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon described the deal as a “huge gamble”, while former foreign secretary Boris Johnson said: “It’s very hard to see how this deal can provide certainty to business or anyone else.”\nFormer Brexit Secretary David Davis, former education secretary Justine Greening and former Northern Ireland secretary Owen Paterson, all Conservatives, also criticised the Government’s approach.\nBlyth Valley MP Ronnie Campbell, a supporter of Brexit on the Labour benches, asked Mrs May if should could promise her deal would “stop the dictates and the stupid laws coming from Europe”.
