International actress Caroline Goodall and North East actor Craig Conway (Image: Newcastle Chronicle)\nHis resignation leaves co-founder Jacqui Miller-Charlton at the helm of the festival - which is due to make a return next year - and of the local production company 54 Films Ltd which sprang up in its wake.\nConway, who is based in London, had brought technical know-how to the festival but now wants to focus more on the grass roots potential of the region's film-making industry rather than support it behind the scenes.\nFinding ways to educate independent film-makers, and to get new work seen and distributed throughout the market, means going back to the making of productions with creative talent, he said.\n\"I want time to be able to pursue the rest of that but the festival becomes a full-time job,\" he explained.\nOn Sunday, Conway will be on the red carpet with fellow cast and crew at the UK premiere of horror film Mara at the Empire Cinema in Leicester Square.\nThe film, which has already had its US debut, sees him play the supporting lead role of a sleep-deprived character called Dougie, opposite actress and model Olga Kurylenko, in a tale by North East writer Jonathan Frank.\nConway, who prior to that co-starred as Russian assassin Viktor in Pierce Brosnan film Final Score, wants to see more film industry connections between the north and south - and the wider world.\n\"We need bigger and stronger connections with the north, south and internationally and, with Brexit looming, I feel it's important we don't divide ourselves anymore,\" he said. Craig Conway (Image: Hightlights PR)\nOf Brexit uncertainty, he feels it's important to embrace and move with what's coming and to build international partnerships.\nBut, at heart, it's the North East that he wants to see reap benefits. \"That is always the aim,\" he said. \"Bringing back to the region is a key focal point. It''s a hotbed of talent.\n\"We are going to be bringing lots of production elements and the support mechanism back to the North East\"\nTo that end, he has a North East project in the pipeline for 2019: a social drama -95% of which will be filmed in the region - involving young people.
