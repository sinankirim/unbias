Dominic Raab Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab (Image: Getty Images Europe)\nIn his letter to the Prime Minister, Mr Raab said the Brexit deal represented a \"very real threat to the integrity of the United Kingdom\" because of provisions for Northern Ireland.\nHe also said he could not accept \"an indefinite backstop arrangement\" for the Irish border.\nHe said: \"No democratic nation has ever signed up to be bound by such an extensive regime, imposed externally without any democratic control over the laws to be applied, nor the ability to decide to exit the arrangement.\" Esther McVey\nWork and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey resigned because Brexit deal \"does not honour the result of the referendum\".\nMs McVey - who is seen as the face of the hugely controversial Universal Credit benefits reform - entered the cabinet in January's reshuffle having spent the period between 2015 and 2017 out of Parliament altogether having lost her Wirral West seat to Labour's Margaret Greenwood.\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: \"I just hope that Esther McVey takes the travesty that is Universal Credit out the door with her.\" Suella Braverman\nThe Brexit minister became the fourth person to resign in backlash.
