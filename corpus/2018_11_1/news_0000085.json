The level of pay workers enjoyed before the crisis is not expected to return until the middle of the next decade.\n“For Londoners the end could still be over a decade away. Scotland in contrast looks likely to return to peak pay first.\n“But while the long-run picture on pay is pretty gloomy, there are now signs that Britain’s long overdue pay recovery is finally gaining momentum.\n“Nominal pay growth has hit 3% for the first time since the crisis, and could strengthen further in the coming months.\n“Sectors like hospitality, finance, and real estate are already experiencing pay rises well above 4% as the pool of available labour to draw upon continues to shrink.\n“Ultimately though, our long-term pay prospects depend on higher productivity growth. Until that happens, we’re unlikely to see a strong and sustained wage recovery.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": ["https://communicatoremail.com/IN/DCF/wo13VulRxfnD9_IKKGjv78/", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/nechronicle/subscriptions/&quot;}"], "published": "2018-11-13T10:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-11-13T11:08:44.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
