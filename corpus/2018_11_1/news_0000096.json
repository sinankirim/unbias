Ending the arrangement would be by mutual agreement by both sides.\nUK sovereign base areas in Cyprus\nThe agreement protects the rights of Cypriots who live and work in the sovereign base areas following the UK's withdrawal.\nGibraltar\nThe agreement provides for close co-operation between the UK and Spain in relation to Gibraltar and the implementation of the provisions on citizens' rights.
