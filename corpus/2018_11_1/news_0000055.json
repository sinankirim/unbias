Prof Clare Bambra, Newcastle University (Image: publicity handout from Newcastle University)\nThe report - which has been commissioned by Northern Health Science Alliance and compiled by six universities - points out that 60% of health research is carried in the ‘golden triangle’ of London, Cambridge and Oxford.\nLead author Professor Clare Bambra, from Newcastle University, said: “This report demonstrates the connection between poor productivity and higher rates of ill health in the North. If you improve health in the North you will improve its productivity – potentially benefiting the whole of the UK’s economy.

There needs to be increased NHS funding in the North, spent on prevention services and health science research.\n“Work needs to be done to improve labour market participation and job retention among people with a health condition in the region. Poorer health in the North affects the entire country’s economy, a healthier Northern Powerhouse will mean a healthier UK economy.”\nThe report found that people in the North suffering a bout of ill health are 39% more likely to lose their job compared to their counterparts in the rest of England. If they return to work, their wages are 66% lower than people in the same situation elsewhere in the country. Dr Hakim Yadi, chief executive of the Northern Health Science Alliance\nBut if the region could reduce rates of ill health by 1.2% and mortality rates by 0.7%, that would reduce the gap in gross value added (GVA) per-head between the North and the rest of England by 10%.\nThe report will be launched today at an event in Newcastle with Dame Jackie Daniel, chief executive Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle City Council leader Nick Forbes, Tees Valley mayor Ben Houchen and Dr Hakim Yadi, CEO of the Northern Health Science Alliance.\nIt recommends improving health in the North by increasing investment in public health and upping NHS funding in the region, particularly looking at prevention services and health research.\nThe report also calls for businesses to support “job retention and health promotion interventions”.

By improving health we can also make a direct impact on productivity and that is something no government should ignore.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": ["https://communicatoremail.com/IN/DCF/wo13VulRxfnD9_IKKGjv78/", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/nechronicle/subscriptions/&quot;}"], "published": "2018-11-20T02:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-11-20T02:32:31.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
