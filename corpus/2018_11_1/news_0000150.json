History of Devon's Ambrosia\n1917: The creamery was founded by Albert Morris in Lifton. Named Ambrosia, which means 'food from the gods' he employed around a dozen locals to make rich food for infants. He took milk from local farms where most of the cows were the Red Ruby breed, and dried it with roller dryers.\n1936: The Creamery passes to Albert's his son Oscar Morris after his death.\nWWII: Ambrosia sent dried milk to help feed children at the time of milk rationing and when many mothers were working in factories to support the war effort. Creamed Rice was included in Red Cross Prisoner of War parcels, with several recipients writing after the war to say they 'owed their lives to it'.\n1956: Oscar Morris retired and sold his controlling interest in the company to Virol Ltd, whose parent company was Bovril Ltd.\n1957: Ambrosia could afford to advertise for the first time and due to increasing demand, the creamery opened a new factory near to the original production facility in Lifton.\n1961: Ambrosia launched the first canned Devon Custard, made on the canning lines in Lifton. By the early 1970s, following investment in the latest canning technology, the quality of Ambrosia Devon Custard is further improved and Ambrosia becomes the brand leader in 'ready-to-serve' custard.\nOne of Ambrosia's main selling points is the fact its made in Devon using local milk, later to become immortalised in the advertising slogan 'Devon knows how they make it so creamy'\n1990: the entire company was acquired by Colman's Ltd., a famous brand of mustard.\n2001: Bought out by Unilever\n2004: Unilever sold the brand on to Premier Foods, which also owns the Bisto, Branston and Hovis brands.\nIt exports to Ireland, Canada and USA and has annual sales of about £90million.\nBut it needs more investment which others will be better able to make, said a spokesman.\nPremier will use the proceeds from any sale to accelerate its strategy and invest in some of its other businesses and pay debt.\nIt was announced on Tuesday that chief executive Gavin Darby will step down on January 31.\nMr Darby's departure will end a six-year tenure at the group and comes after a public row with activist investor Oasis Management, which claimed he has presided over years of value destruction.
