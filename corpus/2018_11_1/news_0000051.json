It has introduced a new IT system to help with online sales, but that has endured ongoing costs.\nThe airline has done better at filling its planes and earning more from every seat – passenger revenue per seat lifted 6.8% as it reduced its flight capacity by 10%.\nBut the airline is dogged by continuing challenges. It is Europe’s largest regional airline but it is a relatively small operation compared to competitors and that means it has to carry the burden of all its backroom costs.\nFlybe has been reducing the number of planes it has from a peak of 85 in May last year to 78 to ensure that they are running at peak profitability, with plans to run at 70 planes. It has also cancelled unprofitable routes.\nIts latest half-year results showed underlying pre-tax profits of £9.9 million, up from £9.2 million a year earlier, while group revenues fell 2.4% to £409.2 million. Five reasons why Flybe is struggling to make money\n1. Passengers are feeling the pinch\nJust like the high street, Flybe is at the mercy of the consumer. It means things like the 'Beast from the East' or Storm Callum puts people off flying or means flights are cancelled. And if consumers are losing jobs or feeling the pinch because of rising household bills, the first thing to drop off the budget is a trip abroad.\n2. Brexit\nThe risks associated with Brexit and what regulation will look like for the aviation industry is a worry. Will there be additional tariffs and visas to think about. Air passenger duty continues to concern airlines - especially Flybe which has a lot of routes and partnerships with other airlines in mainland Europe.\n3. Cost of fuel and the impact of the dollar\nCar drivers will sympathise with this one. Flybe buys its fuel in dollars and the average market price in US Dollar was up 19.1% at $560.\nCurrency is a changeable beast and policy makers like President Trump can and does affect the price.\n4. Planes are expensive\nCapital investment from the outset is high and Flybe has been reducing the number of plane sit has from a peak of 85 in May last year to ensure that they are running at peak profitability. It needs to make sure that its planes are full to be most efficient. It is also cancelling its unprofitable routes.\nAviation is heavily regulated and the airline spends a lot on maintenance.\nIt has also overhauled its IT and digital systems to make sure that customers can book their flights on their mobile devices.\n5. Flybe is a small company\nFlybe may be one of the region's biggest players but it is small compared to the likes of its competitors Easyjet, Ryanair and BA. It means that the back room costs take up a higher proportion of its outlay. It costs about the same to pay for things like maintenance, HR and online bookings for 200 planes as it would for 80, for example.\nThere have also been changes in leadership. Vincent Hodder, Chief Strategy Officer, and Peter Hauptvogel, Chief Information Officer have both left the company.\nThe company’s shares rocketed in February when Stobart Group said it was considering a bid for the company . Stobart and Flybe already work together and have a franchise arrangement between the two groups’ airlines.\nHowever, Stobart walked away from its bid in March after the two firms failed to agree terms .\nNow, there is speculation that Stobart Group could be a potential buyer for Flybe.\nBut it also recorded disappointing results last month with a pre-tax loss of £17.5m in the six months to the end of August.\nIn September, Ryanair announced that it would start flying from Exete r, sparking a price war with Flybe.\nRyanair said the six weekly flights would bring 80,000 customers through the Devon airport and “put Exeter on the map” for foreign tourists.\nThe airline has strong links in Exeter and the region in skills and training. Around 250 students have come through a four-year Flybe engineering programme at Exeter College so far and is so sought after that 160 applicants applied for just 15 spaces on its aerospace apprentice scheme this year.\nBack in 2016, Flybe’s former chief executive Saad Hammad stepped down and was paid more than £430,000 during a year of gardening leave. Mr Hammad joined Flybe in August 2013 and oversaw a wide-ranging overhaul of the company’s operations aimed at reviving its fortunes. Under his three-year tenure, Flybe went from a £35.6m loss in 2015 to a £2.7m profit in 2016.
