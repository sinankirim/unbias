JD Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin\nHe will warn that advantages will be lost if the Government signs up for a deal with the EU, which keeps the UK tied in to the \"protectionist\" EU customs union.\nMr Martin said: \"Now that the details of the appalling deal, negotiated by the Downing Street kitchen cabinet have become clear, it is certain the UK will be financially far better off by choosing no deal.\n\"The hard mathematics demonstrate beyond doubt that no deal leaves the public and the UK better-off on day one after Brexit.\n\"The UK will immediately gain by non-payment of the proposed Â£39 billion, for which lawyers have repeatedly confirmed there is no legal liability. Read More\n\"No deal also allows parliament, on 29 March 2019, to slash import taxes (tariffs) on over 12,000 non-EU products, including oranges, rice, coffee, wine and children's clothes.\n\"Ending these tariffs will immediately reduce shop prices to UK consumers.\n\"There is no loss of income to the government from slashing these tariffs, since the proceeds are currently remitted to Brussels.\n\"Most importantly, no deal allows the UK to regain control of historic fishing grounds, where 60% of fish today are landed by EU boats.\" Mr Martin said the current deal is a mechanism for remaining \"trapped in an undemocratic and financially inefficient system.\"\nMr Martin will be at The William Jameson at 1pm on December 6 and The Mile Castle at 4pm the same day.
