It includes a temporary Irish backstop to prevent a hard border, access for the UK and the EU to each others markets, and talk of an \"ambitious customs arrangement\" in the future relationship. Prime Minister Theresa May makes a statement outside 10 Downing Street (Image: PA)\nThere has been criticism of the proposal from both political sides. Jeremy Corbyn labelled it a \"botched deal\" in Prime Minister's Questions earlier on Wednesday.\nMeanwhile Conservative backbencher and chair of the European Research Group Jacob Rees-Mogg wrote to fellow Tory MPs urging them not to support the deal.

This is a decision which will come under intense scrutiny, and that is entirely as it should be and entirely understandable.\n\"But the choice was this deal, which enables us to take back control and to build a brighter future for our country, or going back to square one with more division, more uncertainty and a failure to deliver on the referendum.\n\"It is my job as Prime Minister to explain the decisions that the Government has taken and I stand ready to do that, beginning tomorrow with a statement in Parliament. \"If I might end by just saying this: I believe that what I owe to this country is to take decisions that are in the national interest.\n\"And I firmly believe, with my head and my heart, that this is a decision which is in the best interests of our entire united Kingdom.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": ["https://communicatoremail.com/IN/DCF/wo13VulRxfnD9_IKKGjv78/", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/nechronicle/subscriptions/&quot;}"], "published": "2018-11-14T22:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-11-15T00:08:58.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
