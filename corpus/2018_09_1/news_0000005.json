Workers at Nissan (Image: PA)\nIt said: “The Commission is proposing a CETA-style Free Trade Agreement, but we note that this would not, on its own, ensure the type of friction-free trade that many companies with just-in-time supply chains need.”\nAnd MPs said the UK Government’s proposals, known as the Chequers agreement, are doomed to failure because the EU will not agree to them.\nMPs said one solution would be to stay in the European Economic Area. This means staying in the EU’s single market and the Customs Union, allowing products to be moved without restriction between the EU and the UK. The EU flag and a Union Jack (Image: PA)\nSome Brexiteers oppose this option because it would mean the UK continued to obey some EU rules.\nThe Committee said another option would be to form a Customs Union with the EU - combined with “continued alignment on relevant EU rules”, which once again would mean the UK continues to obey some rules made in Brussels.
