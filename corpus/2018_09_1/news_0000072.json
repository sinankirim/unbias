Debate is being stifled.”\nA Best for Britain spokesman said the organisation had asked the Conservatives for an explanation, but had not been given one.\nPressure groups, think tanks, trade unions and a range of other organisations traditionally send representatives to party conferences, and are given passes.\nLabour and the Conservative Party have even provided conference passes to each other in recent years.\nAnd the Labour leader of Birmingham City Council is due to speak inside the secure zone, and will need a pass to do so. Read More MPs on maternity leave will be allowed to cast 'proxy votes'\nBut it seems that the Tories are worried about allowing entry to supporters of a second referendum.\nAs well as speeches from the main stage, party conferences include hundreds of smaller “fringe” events where people from a range of organisations speak.\nBest for Britain said it would press ahead with its fringe events, but they will take place outside the secure zone.\nMrs May will deliver her high-profile speech on Wednesday September 3, the final day of the conference.
