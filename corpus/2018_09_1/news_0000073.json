Read More\nThe second most feasible corridor would be the A1 between Sheffield and Edinburgh, followed by the M5/A38 route between Plymouth and Birmingham. poll loading Should we have self-driving lorries on our roads? 0+ VOTES SO FAR Yes No\nThe M25 London orbital motorway was selected as the road where driverless lorry technology could lead to the biggest safety improvement, due to having a significantly higher levels of dangerous incidents per mile than any other route.\nCoventry-Manchester on the M6 was in second place.\nThe report stated that highly automated vehicles are \"posed to dramatically alter the long-haul trucking sector\".\nIt predicted that the cost of the technology will decline as it is developed, and stated that it could provide \"valuable savings\" for UK firms due to the shortage of qualified HGV drivers and uncertainty over the movement of people after Brexit. Read More First new express trains arrive in Devon\nPlatoons of self-driving lorries are expected to be trialled on England's motorways by the end of the year.\nUp to three wirelessly connected HGVs will travel in convoy, with acceleration and braking controlled by the lead vehicle.\nLorries driving close together could see the front vehicle pushing air out of the way, making the other vehicles more efficient and lowering their emissions.\nThe Government announced in August 2017 that it would provide Â£8.1 million of funding towards the trials, which will be carried out by the Transport Research Laboratory.\nAll lorries involved will have a driver ready to take control if required.
