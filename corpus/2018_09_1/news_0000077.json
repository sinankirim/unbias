Labour shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer (Image: Daily Record)\n“On the contrary, they say, what can do you do protect this model? Because we don’t want to lose jobs, we don’t want to lose manufacturing, we don’t want to move our factories.”\nSir Keir highlighted the threat to the “just in time” method used by many major manufacturers, which depends on the ability to import parts from across the EU without restrictions.\nMany of the parts come from suppliers in EU countries and the system would grind to a halt if there were long checks at borders.\nHe said he’d met with “the best part of 1,000 businesses” over the past two years, particularly manufacturers.\n“Whether it’s the trains in the North East, some of the carmakers, the potteries in Stoke, the aerospace industry elsewhere, I’ve had long and confidential discussions both with the workforce and with the management.
