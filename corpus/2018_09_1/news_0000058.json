We must lead by example.\n“Our energy plans would make Britain the only developed country outside Scandinavia to be on track to meet our climate change obligations.”\nOther measures in his green jobs plan include a sevenfold increase in offshore wind, a trebling of solar energy generation and making all homes energy efficient. Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn (Image: PA)\nThe speech will be the culmination of Labour’s annual conference , where the party has attempted to explain how it would transform the economy to create a fairer society.\nThe conference was dominated by debate over Brexit, with campaigners calling on Labour to support a so-called “People’s Vote” or second referendum on whether to leave the EU.\nBut Labour avoided a major row, with most delegates uniting around a policy of keeping open the option of supporting a Brexit referendum but not necessarily backing the idea.\nIn his speech, Mr Corbyn will also hit out at the “greed-is-good, deregulated financial capitalism” which 10 years ago “came crashing to earth, with devastating consequences for millions of people”.\nThe Labour leader will say: “Instead of making essential changes to a broken economic system, the political and corporate establishment strained every sinew to bail out and prop up the system that led to the crash in the first place.” Read More Why passengers could soon be able to travel across the North using their smart phone\nAs the Government that bailed out the banks was led by Gordon Brown, his attack on the “political establishment” of the time appears to be a criticism of a former Labour Prime Minister.\nOn creating 400,000 skilled green jobs, Jeremy Corbyn will say Britain needs a Government “committed to investing in renewables, in jobs and in training”.\nHe will announce that Labour will work with industry and unions to invest in jobs and training, with a plan to reduce net carbon emissions by 60% by 2030 and zero by 2050.\nAnd Mr Corbyn will say this major investment, driven by a share of Labour’s planned £250 billion national transformation fund, will bring “skills and security to communities held back for too long”.\nThe insulation programme will create 160,000 jobs alone, spread across the UK.\nHe is expected to say: “There is no bigger threat facing humanity than climate change. We must lead by example.\n“Our energy plans would make Britain the only developed country outside Scandinavia to be on track to meet our climate change obligations.\n“That means working with unions representing the workforce to ensure jobs and skills are protected as we move towards a low-carbon economy.
