I instantly take his opinion over all others.\"\nLuke Jackson said: \"If anyone was to have a sweater draped over the shoulders on live TV, it would be Tim Martin.\"\nAnd @pinknouveau said: \"Tim Martin looks so chill. He’s going down the spa after his interview with GMB...\nA number of users even called him a 'legend'.\nTim was on the show to discuss how currency market volatility is hurting sales and profits.\nAsked what his final piece of advice to Theresa May would be, Tim said: \"Theresa, cut those tariffs, forget Chequers, don't pay £39billion, regain control of fishing and we will all be really happy.\"\nHe didn't, however, offer her any fashion tips.
