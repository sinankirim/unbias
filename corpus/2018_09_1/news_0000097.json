What would happen if there's a no-deal Brexit?\nThe Leicestershire business said in the \"unlikely event\" that free-trade agreements were not put in place, it could send the cost of goods soaring by up to around £20 million, which would add almost 0.5 per cent to its prices.\nBut it said the no-deal risks do not pose a \"material threat to the ongoing operations and profitability\" of Next in the UK or EU.\nDetails of its no-deal plans came as it upped its full-year profit outlook after a better-than-expected first half, with interim pre-tax profits up 0.5 per cent at £311.1 million in the six months to July.\nIt has managed to avoid many of the problems faced by other high street retailers such as House of Fraser, Debenhams and Poundworld, mainly thanks to its strong online operation Next Directory.\nAnd while profits at Next remain steady, by comparison John Lewis recently announced its profits had fallen to almost zero in the first half of the year, partly down to its policy of price matching against rivals.
