Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury has warned that Britain’s economy is not working for the North and needs “fundamental reform”.\nArchbishop Justin Welby is one of the authors of a new report calling for the wholesale transformation of the UK economy.\nIt highlights research showing that incomes in the North East are a third less than in London and the south east. Read More HS2 rail project delayed by a year - but here's why it could mean better services for Newcastle\nAnd it calls for the creation of four “regional economic executives” in the North, Midlands, South West and South East, which would take responsibility for economic and industrial strategy and report to local mayors and councillors instead of the Westminster government.\nOther proposals include an immediate £1 increase to the minimum wage - and giving everyone a £10,000 gift on their 25th birthday.\nArchbishop Welby, England’s most senior churchman and a former Bishop of Durham, said: “For decades the UK economy has not worked as it should, with millions of people and many parts of the country receiving less than their fair share. The widening gulf between rich and poor, and fears about the future among young people and their parents, have damaged our nation’s sense of itself.\n“Our report shows that it doesn’t have to be like this. By putting fairness at the heart of the economy, we can make it perform better, improving the lives of millions of people.\n“Achieving prosperity and justice together is not only a moral imperative – it is an economic one.”\nThe report was produced by the IPPR Commission on Economic Justice, which includes senior figures from business, industry and academia.\nOther members included Lord Bob Kerslake, the former Head of the Civil Service; Frances O’Grady, General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress, and businessman John Mills, founder of JML.\nThe Commission’s report, called Prosperity & Justice: A Plan for the New Economy, follows two years of research and consultation.\nProposals include: An immediate increase of around £1 an hour in the minimum wage to the Real Living Wage, and requiring all those on zero-hours contracts to be paid 20 per cent above the higher rate, along with a package of measures to revitalise trade unions An industrial strategy supporting a ‘new industrialisation’ to boost the UK’s exports and close the trade deficit, backed by a new National Investment Bank and by raising public investment by £15bn a year to 3.5% of GDP Major changes to how UK companies are governed with the inclusion of workers on company boards, a rise in corporation tax from 19 per cent to 24 per cent. A new “alternative minimum corporation tax” to be charged on multi-national firms that claim they don’t make much profit in the UK The acceleration of automation across the economy, managed by a new partnership of business, trade unions and government, alongside regulation of near-monopoly tech giants as utilities through a new watchdog called the Office of Digital Platforms * Taxing work and wealth on the same basis, with a new, single, income tax schedule for all types of income. This would end the current discrepancy where people who earn money from the return on investment pay a lower tax rate than people who earn a salary Creating a Citizens’ Wealth Fund, possibly by imposing a new tax on the most wealthy or by selling government assets, which would be used to give everyone £10,000 when they turn 25, to invest in their education, put down a deposit on a home or start a business.\nThe North East isn’t the only region of the UK to suffer as a result of massive inequalities. The report points out that London is the richest region in northern Europe, yet the UK also has six of the 10 poorest regions.\nBut there is a stark gap in the level of wealth enjoyed by people the North East and the south.\nThe average household in the south east has wealth of £380,600, more than double the average wealth of households in the North East, which comes to £163,000.\nAcross the UK as a whole the richest 1 per cent are estimated to own 14 per cent of the nation’s wealth, while 15 per cent of adults either have nothing or have debts which come to more than the value of everything they own.\nHelena Morrissey, Head of Personal Investing at Legal & General and member of the Commission, said: “We live in an era of profound change and societal challenge. Whatever happens with Brexit, the British economy needs to be more balanced, more productive and more inclusive if we are to thrive in the 2020s.\n“We need government and business working together to improve growth and share its proceeds more fairly. This is a fantastic country and this report shows how we can solve the challenges we face, seize opportunities and prosper in the future.” Read More Revealed: The staggering amount increasing 'real' living wage would boost the North East economy\nFrances O’Grady, General Secretary of the TUC and member of the Commission, said: “It’s time for a once-in-a-generation rethink of our approach to the economy. Working people have had enough of stagnating living standards and massive inequality. And no one’s buying the idea that there’s no alternative.\n“A better deal for a working people is possible, and will allow us to build a stronger, fairer economy.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": ["https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/nechronicle/subscriptions/&quot;}"], "published": "2018-09-05T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-09-05T07:31:32.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
