Richard Alderman sent a Facebook post calling for the Prime Minister Theresa May to be hanged\nThe 72-year-old admitted four charges of sending a menacing or grossly offensive message via the public communication network.\nThey included posts describing Ms Abbott as a \"monkey\" and calling for Ms Soubry to be shot and drowned.\nAfter the hearing Leicestershire Police officer DC Young said: “The content of the comments published by Alderman were deemed offensive.\n\"He is a prominent member of the Rutland community and should have known better as an elected councillor.\n“We treat all reports of this nature seriously, irrespective of who has made them, and we’re pleased that he has admitted the offences.”\nOrdering pre-sentence reports, District Judge David Robinson had told Alderman: \"You have pleaded guilty to these four charges and you will receive credit for that in due course.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-09-27T22:04:05.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
