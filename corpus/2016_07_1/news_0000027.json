Jon Ferris, Utilitywise strategy director \nJon Ferris, strategy director at North Tyneside energy giant Utilitywise, expects to see little change with the UK’s commitment to low-carbon energy well advanced and measures such as the Carbon Price Floor generating £1.5bn a year for the Treasury. \nThe Conservative Government has set its stall out to create a UK shale gas industry as this is unlikely to change, and efforts to phase out UK coal power plants will continue. \nIndications that investment in new capacity may stall were demonstrated by Siemens’ announcement last week that it plans a UK offshore wind investment freeze until the post-vote landscape becomes clear. \nHowever the offshore wind sector is one which the conservatives have continued to back, as Mr Ferris highlighted. \nHe said: “The money put aside to support renewable technologies will mostly now go to offshore wind, while the Capacity market (designed to support baseload capacity) is being used to subsidise coal and diesel generation.” \nProfessor Simon Hogg, DONG Professor in Renewable Energy and Executive Director at Durham Energy Institute, believes the vote will not impact on the UK green energy transition although he says it may be given less priority than energy security. \nConcerns over the UK’s energy security over the coming winters has risen sharply up the political agenda in recent years, as we aim to phase-out coal power plants within 10 years. \nProf Hogg said: “While Brexit has escalated concerns over the French commitment to Hinkley Point C in Somerset (a new nuclear power station) there are more pressing concerns over the next two years. \n“We are already in a difficult situation with six out of 14 coal power stations closing in the last year and the ones that remain open are finding it very difficult to make money. \n“There are issues around our current nuclear fleet and if one or more of these were to suffer a fault, there is a very real possibility of black-outs this winter. Brexit has not helped by making the money available for maintenance more difficult to come by due to the increased uncertainty in the money markets.” Professor Simon Hogg, executive director of the Durham Energy Institute \nMr Hewitt believes the UK Government and the National Grid will do all they can to ensure the lights don’t go out. \nHe said: “Here at EnAppSys we say the lights will never go out as the National Grid will use all the money it can to prevent blackouts and industry will be paid to shut down during periods of high demand.” \nMr Hewitt says the UK has the chance to remain in the IEM by adopting a Norwegian model which allows it to participate without having any input in its decisions. Switzerland has stayed out and pays higher electricity bills, he said. \nHe fears plans that plans for two additional electricity interconnectors between the UK and the continent, one through the Channel Tunnel and one to Belgium, which could deliver 2GW of capacity, will fall by the wayside. \nHowever Mr Ferris believes there will be no impact here and planned interconnectors will be developed including the one between the UK and Norway. \n“It makes commercials sense for the French to have somewhere to export their excess nuclear power,” he said. \nThe National Grid Brexit report also highlighted how being in the EU contributed to a stable investment climate and investor confidence is particularly critical in the energy sector where investors look at 20 year time scales. \nSuch confidence has already been hit by a series of policy U-turns since last year’s General Election which have been to the detriment of renewables energies such as onshore wind and solar power. \n“There is not a huge amount of confidence in the sector in first place. We have been muddling along before the Brexit vote and we are muddling along now. The one certainty in the energy industry is that there is always uncertainty,” added Mr Ferris. \nFollow Peter McCusker on Twitter @mccusker60", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-06T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-06T21:07:29.205+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
