Chief operating officer Andy Keeling will cover the role in the meantime. \nBefore joining the LLEP, Mr Crane was head of economic partnerships and inward investment at Wolverhampton City Council. \nHe said: \"I am really proud to be taking up this role as chief executive at the Black Country Chamber of Commerce. \n\"I know the area well and understand what a diverse and entrepreneurial cluster of businesses are based there, with such a clear sense of identity. \n\"I also know that for all the opportunities there are at the moment for forward-looking businesses, there are also a huge amount of challenges from Brexit, from a slowdown in manufacturing, imports being hit by a weaker pound and foreign investors delaying decisions in an uncertain political environment. \n\"The chamber has a long history of supporting businesses to seize opportunities regardless of national economic trends and in making the business voice heard at every level of decision makers. \n\"I'm looking forward to working with the chamber team and Black Country businesses to continue to do all this and more.\" \nCity mayor Peter Soulsby said: \"Both Frank and Corin have been instrumental figures in the regeneration of the city over recent years. \n\"In the four years Frank has worked at the council, he has delivered a range of creative and ambitious projects. \n\"He has played an important part in creating momentum for regeneration and investment in the city. \n\"Likewise, Corin has played a vital part in creating one of the most successful inward investment partnerships in Britain. \n\"I wish them both well in their new roles and we will move quickly to find replacements.\" \nMr Jordan said: \"I've really enjoyed my time in Leicester and I'd like to thank the many colleagues and partners I've worked with over the past four years, who have enabled so many great projects to be delivered. \n\"I'm now looking forward to the new challenges that lay ahead and the next phase of my career.\" \nAdrian Wright, Black Country Chamber of Commerce president, said: \"I am thrilled with the appointment of Corin Crane as the new chamber chief executive. \n\"Corin can really help build for the future by creating a bigger and stronger chamber to support local businesses. \n\"He also has a wealth of experience and knowledge to bring to his new role which will help to continue the great work the chamber team is doing.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-19T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-19T09:31:38.298+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
