He also said there was still a lack of quality homes in the UK. \nMeanwhile, Breedon was changing hands at 68p a share on June 23, and after falling to 54p bounced back to 62p today. \nIbstock shares fell from £1.99 on June 23 to £1.28 today, while Topps Tiles, of Enderby, has gone from £1.48 to 99p. \nShares in three of the four have rallied in recent days, despite still being substantially down on the days building up to the referendum. \nShare specialists said confidence in construction and the property market \"soured\" after the Brexit vote, although prices were not expected to be hit as badly as they were during the Credit Crunch. \nA spokesman for stockbroker AJ Bell said: \"Since the EU referendum vote, the roof has fallen in on Barratt's shares – as it has across the whole housebuilding sector – and they have fallen to two-year lows amid as yet unfounded fears that a UK house price and broader economic downturn may follow the Leave vote.\" \nDavid Cheetham, market analyst and foreign exchange broker at trading company XTB.com, said while the long-term impact of Brexit on construction was uncertain, there had been \"panic-selling in shares of firms within the industry\". \nHe said: \"Not all of this sharp sell-off in price should be attributed solely to adverse trading conditions in the new post-Brexit UK as [not] until Article 50 is invoked and a Brexit actually occurs will there be any material impact on trading terms. \n\"Furthermore, at least a portion of the selling seen since June 23 could be seen as an over-reaction as the markets clearly believed that the Remain camp would prevail – as evidenced by the price action in the pound before and after the result was announced. \n\"Barratt Developments and Ibstock are among the worst hit since the vote, but the impact can be felt industry-wide. \n\"Whilst there is little to suggest this will mark a substantial house price decline like the one seen during the 2008 financial crisis, sentiment has certainly soured and the relentless run-up in house prices over the past few years may at the very least pause until investors can ascertain with a greater degree of certainty the longer term implications for property of a Brexit.\" \nMr Cheetham said an anticipated cut in the Bank of England base rate would go \"some way\" to alleviating fears, although the \"cloud of uncertainty\" remained overhead and could see house price growth checked. \nOn Friday, the International Monetary Fund downgraded its projections for growth in the Euro area.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-11T11:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-11T11:57:46.906+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
