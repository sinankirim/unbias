Neither Theresa May, who campaigned to remain in the EU, nor Andrea Leadsom, who fought for Leave but did not sign the regional pledge, could be held to the pledge. \nNorth East LEP chair Andrew Hodgson said: “We are hopeful that these projects will be honoured by Government and deliver important support to businesses and local people before Brexit happens. \n“It is important to realise we will not be immediately losing the opportunities that EU funding has historically brought to the North East. \n“Millions of pounds of projects are still likely to go ahead, bringing new jobs and closing the skills gap in the North East. The truth is that we just don’t know yet if or when we will see changes. \n“EU funding has hugely benefitted the North East over the last few decades and we are lobbying Government for clarity and seeking assurances that any potential future funding gap will be filled. We urge the Government to provide this guidance quickly to ensure opportunities to create jobs and growth are not lost.” \nThe LEP said there was “no formal Government guidance” on how much funding will be available in the future for North East businesses and organisations beyond the projects already approved.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-07T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-07T21:30:13.248+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
