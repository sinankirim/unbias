The iPhone SE, Apple’s first 4-inch smartphone since 2013, was launched in March as a lower cost alternative to their flagship 6s and 6s Plus.

However, some economists are pencilling in GDP to notch up 0.5% after a string of reports showed a mixed picture for the UK economy ahead of the Brexit vote.Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the ONS first estimate for second quarter GDP will signal whether the UK economy headed into the EU referendum from a position of strength.He added: “First, it will tell us if the referendum gave the UK economy the jitters in the lead up to the vote.“There are several indicators which have pointed to a slowdown in economic activity as the referendum approached.”He said, now the result of the vote is known, the latest figures “will also indicate whether we are entering the implementation of a Brexit from a position of strength, or as seems more likely, a position of weakness”. 08:53 Robert Gibson-NEC Smith commits to equality at work Owen Smith 08:51 Robert Gibson-NEC Meanwhile, ITV is less confident on the EU front \nITV will slash £25 million in costs next year as a direct result of Britain’s decision to quit the European Union.The broadcaster said it has put in place a “robust plan” to meet the challenges Brexit is set to pose.Chief executive Adam Crozier said: “Against a backdrop of wider economic uncertainty following the EU referendum we have put in place a robust plan to allow us to meet the opportunities and challenges ahead.“As part of this we are targeting a £25 million reduction in overheads for 2017.”ITV made the announcement alongside results for the first half of the year, which saw total external revenue rise 11% to £1.5 billion.Pre-tax profits increased 9% to £425 million but the firm warned that advertising revenue is set to dip 1% in the nine months to the end of September.Mr Crozier added: “Our strategy of strengthening and rebalancing the business is clearly working and remains the right one for ITV. We have a strong balance sheet and the capacity to continue to invest behind our strategy, while at the same time delivering returns to our shareholders.” 08:46 Robert Gibson-NEC 'No better place in Europe' \nResponding to GSK’s announcement, the Business and Energy Secretary, Greg Clark said: “An investment of this scale is a clear vote of confidence in Britain and underlines our position as a global business leader. \n“GSK’s recognition of our skilled workforce, world leading scientific capabilities and competitive tax environment is further proof that there really is no place better in Europe to grow a business.” Greg Clark 08:41 Robert Gibson-NEC North East site to get £92 cut \nIt is believed that GSK’s Barnard Castle site will receive a £92m cut of the overall investment, funding the construction of a sterile facility to make biological molecules. \nGSK manufactures at nine UK sites, employing 6,000 people \nBarnard Castle is one of its biggest secondary manufacturing sites, employing 1,100 staff. \nThe site supplies almost half a million packs of products per day to 140 global markets. 08:31 Robert Gibson-NEC BREAKING: GSK's Co.
