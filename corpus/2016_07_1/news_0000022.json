South Shields MP Emma Lewell-Buck \nBut the loss of EU funding would “push a coach and horses through that deal”, Bishop Auckland MP Helen Goodman warned. \nAnd South Shields MP Emma Lewell-Buck urged Ministers to draw up a new devolution deal - but her request was turned down. \nShe told House of Commons: “Over the next five years alone, the North East was due to receive £726 million in EU funding, but the North East devolution deal promises only £30 million a year for 30 years.” \nThe MP added: “With such high levels of uncertainty because of Brexit , is it not time he revisited all the devolution deals?” \nBut Local Government Secretary Sajid Javid told her: “There is no need to reconsider any of the deals. These are good deals that have been reached by local leaders and central Government, and they will all, in turn, help to boost local growth.” \nQuestioning Treasury Ministers, Mrs Goodman asked the Government if it could guarantee the money would be provided. \nShe said: “Without a guarantee from the government, this will push a coach and horses through that deal.” PA Wire Helen Goodman \nDavid Gauke, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said he could not make any guarantee now. \nHe said: We recognise the need to bring any uncertainty to an end as soon as we possibly can \n“In the circumstances it is right that we take a moment before making any guarantees \n“But let me absolutely clear, as a government we remain committed to doing everything we can do to strengthen the Northern Powerhouse, to ensure that the north of England fulfils its full potential.” \nHe added: “On the specific point, we will be making an announcement in the not too distant future.” \nThere are a number of buildings and projects in the North East which benefitted directly from EU grants in the past. \nThey include Portobello Trade Park in Durham, financed with £2.7m in European Regional Development Fund funding, Consett Business Park in Durham, which received £1.1m in ERDF funding, the regeneration of a 660-hectare area on the River Tyne North Bank, which benefitted from £2.4m in ERDF funding, and Core Science Central in Newcastle city centre, which was built with the support of £5.6m in ERDF funding.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-20T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-20T07:50:26.143+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
