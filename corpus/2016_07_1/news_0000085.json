vital for manufacturers, who'll want to support retailers Shares Get business news by email Peter Jones \nFast growing motor retailer Vertu Motors says the new UK car market should remain strong post-Brexit as a direct result of Sterling’s fall against the Euro. \nThe Gateshead-headquartered business said it is monitoring the negotiations of the trade relations between the EU and UK, following the referendum result, stressing how a manufacturer partners will likely want to support UK retailers through any period of uncertainty. \nThe majority of the Group’s new vehicle sales are imported to the UK from the EU, and directors have noted uncertainty for the economy and the motor retail industry, which supports thousands of jobs, following the June 23 vote. \nAt the firm’s AGM, chairman Peter Jones said: “Regulations surrounding manufacturer franchise contracts are currently determined on an EU basis by manufacturers and reflect EU competition policy. \n“The Board, at this stage, does not anticipate any major changes to the franchise contract position under which the Group transacts with our manufacturer partners resulting from the UK leaving the EU. \n“The UK represents the second biggest market for new vehicles in the current EU and thousands of continental European jobs are reliant on a continuation of this trade with the UK. \n“Consequently, the Board believes that Manufacturer partners are likely to be keen to support UK retailers through any period of uncertainty. \n“Our manufacturer partners clearly have a vital interest in ensuring continued free trade access to the key UK market and the Board will be monitoring the negotiations of the trade relations between the EU and UK.” Read More Gateshead's Vertu continues 'buy and build' strategy with £18.7m acquisition \nMr Jones said the Sterling/Euro exchange rate is important to manufacturer profitability on the UK sales and is a factor in determining the level of supply push of vehicles into the UK market. \nHe said: “Whilst sterling has declined against the Euro following the referendum result, it remains at levels above the lows seen in 2008/9, and more recently throughout much of 2013, and at levels which the Board believes remain attractive for European Manufacturers to export vehicles to the UK. \n“This should help to underpin the UK new car market which is currently at record levels. \nDuring the AGM Mr Jones updated shareholder on the four month trading period to June 30, which shows profitability is ahead of the same period last year and in line with the Board’s expectations. \nTotal revenues increased by 21.5% with like-for-like revenues increasing by 8.4%, and the group’s aftersales operations continued to grow strongly with service revenues up 25.6% in the period, an increase of 6.1% on a like-for-like basis. \nA strong used vehicle performance with total used vehicle volumes up 19.2%, an increase of 10.2% on a like-for-like basis. \nMr Jones said the majority of £35m raised in the March Placing in March has also now been used to make acquisitions, which has included the buyout of Leeds Jaguar, Gordon Lamb Group Limited in Derbyshire and \nthe freehold and long leasehold interests from Honda in two Honda dealerships operated by the Group in Nottingham and Derby.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-20T14:50:00.000+03:00",
