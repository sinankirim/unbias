Journal business breakfast meeting at Bond Dickinson \n“Then we hit the buffers and could actually feel the transactions landscape slowing down,” he said. \n“We didn’t know it at the time, but the banks were running out of money.” \nFollowing a short period of uncertainty, however, he argued that there was every reason to expect a brighter picture going forward. \nSteve Plaskitt, of Tait Walker, Graham Lowes, of Lloyds Bank, and Tony Leech, of HSBC, agreed with that sentiment, the latter pointing out that around nine out of 10 applications for funding it handled were successful. \n“We definitely have the money to lend and we want to lend that money,” he said. \nRod Wilkinson, of KPMG, also suggested the funds were still there, but added that deals were perhaps taking longer to finalise due to increased care over due diligence. \nThere was also, he accepted, a certain proportion of “really important” small businesses for which it was harder to cater – an example of which was Tyne Bank Brewery. Julia Austin from Tyne Bank Brewery \nBrewery director Julia Austin told the meeting how she had met with numerous banks, yet was unable to find an investment source that would not involve her putting her home at risk as a guarantee. \nThe former Nissan employee turned to crowdfunding to help the business achieve its goals of hitting £1m turnover and employing 14 people within two years. \nThe campaign was a huge success, raising more than £213,000 from 367 investors, who each received equity plus additional perks for investments ranging from £10 to £17,000. \n“It really works – because now we have 367 ambassadors who will go into pubs and ask the landlords why they haven’t got our beers on,” Ms Austin said. \n“They have bought into the ethos of the business. \n“People with money want to see it benefit the North East; they are not particularly interested in what is in it for them.” \nMr Phillips, however, suggested that, historically, North East businesspeople had not been so keen to share equity in their companies, their mentality being: “This is my business and I don’t really want to share it with anybody else.” \nIt was a point embraced by Tony Cleary, managing director of Lanchester Wines, which has taken its turnover from £28m to £78m within the past five years. \n“It is 100% family-owned and will stay that way as far as I am concerned,” he said. “I want this to be a legacy business.” \nHe added that, in contrast to the considerably smaller Tyne Bank, he had received “great” support from HSBC. \n“The banks have changed – it’s not harder to get the money, but there is so much more paperwork,” he said. \n“The presentation has got to be slick; you can’t just get on the telephone and ask for half-a-million quid. It’s not like that any more. \n“The banks have made a lot of money from us, but I have no problem with that; if it wasn’t for the banks, we wouldn’t be where we are today.” \nChris Boyes, of the Business Growth Fund, who retains an involvement with a number of North East companies in the organisation’s portfolio, stressed that businesses do not “give away” equity but sell it in exchange for investment that is crucial for expansion. \n“I encourage companies to speak to those within our portfolio,” he said. “The proof of the pudding is what things are like afterwards.” \nMr Phillips similarly suggested that talking about “success stories” such as that of Durham’s Atom Bank or Burnopfield’s Quantum Pharma could help encourage more to come forward. \nYvonne Gale, of NEL Fund Managers, however, said these represented the “pinnacle” of what can happen, and could fell like a “parallel universe” to small businesses. \nTom Rowley, of North Edge Private Equity, likewise suggested that while it was good for businesses seeking investment to hear from those that had succeeded in the process, it would also be useful for them to meet with companies that had had less luck. \n“It is important to speak to people in businesses that have perhaps not performed as well as originally expected,” he said. \n“That provides a chance to see how the private equity provider acted in such a situation. It’s at those tough times when you really want someone with you supporting you through it.” \nHe added that while some challenges may remain, this appeared to be a “very good time in which to be investing”. \nThe meeting also involved discussion on the impact of Brexit, with most of those at the meeting having been in the Remain camp. \nMr Cleary, who voted for the UK to leave the EU, said: “I honestly think things will go on as ever and it will be a great opportunity for the country. \n“That is because the EU isn’t working - it’s broken and we have had 40 years to make it better.” \nMs Gale said: “We are in danger of literally talking ourselves into a recession by assuming it – but nobody knows. \n“The other important thing that gets lost is that every time there are ups and downs in the economy, somebody makes money. \n“It presents opportunities as well as difficulties and it’s the small, agile businesses that spot that.” \nMr Leech, meanwhile, suggested that, while some uncertainty was inevitable, there was little option but to proceed with “business as usual”. \n“We have spent lots of time in the last few days contacting as many customers as we can just to reassure them we are still around and to gauge how they are feeling,” he said. \n“Business is resilient. Generally, the feeling among our customers is that just need to get on with things. \n“I’ve not come across anyone who is desperately worried.” \nNick Edgar, of Yorkshire Bank, pointed out that the UK had two years in which to get a deal together. He said: “We have a decent window in which to readjust and recalibrate.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-08T14:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-08T18:15:04.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
