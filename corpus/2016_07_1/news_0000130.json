R 09:21 Training company expands to the BIC \nA training provider has opened a second office in Sunderland as it gears up for growth. In addition to a city centre training facility, Milltech Training has opened a second office at the North East Business and Innovation Centre (BIC) acquiring over 2000 sq ft of office space. The company, which boasts an 88% success rate and Grade 2 Ofsted, has moved into the BIC’s Riverview to focus on recruiting adult learners onto management courses as well as providing new 16+ apprentices for businesses in the city centre and at the BIC. With just over 250 apprentices on Milltech’s books and over 21 employees, the company was keen to offer two locations to suit all employer and learner needs. 09:18 Peers warn on Channel Four privatisation \nPrivatising Channel Four would badly damage the quality of its output and probably see the broadcaster fall into foreign hands, peers have warned.The House of Lords Communications Committee urged the Government not to sell off the network in order to raise billions of pounds for the Exchequer.It warned Culture Secretary John Whittingdale that any benefits would be out-weighed by negatives.A report by the committee rejected claims by Mr Whittingdale that privatisation could help secure the future of the public broadcaster.Committee chairman Lord Best said: “Channel Four is an important and much-valued part of the nation’s media landscape, and boasts an array of innovative and creative programming as well as a strong commitment to public service broadcasting.” 09:13 Study shows business response to introduction of national living wage \nFirms have increased prices or cut profits rather than lay off workers to pay for the national living wage, a new study has revealed.Research by the Resolution Foundation found that a third of employers have faced a higher wage bill following the new £7.20 hourly rate from April.But a survey of 500 businesses showed that only 6% said the new rate had increased their wages bill to a large extent.Around one in six expect the living wage to increase their wage bill in the future.More than one in three of the firms affected said they had increased prices, while 29% were taking lower profits.The study also showed that 15% had invested more in training and one in eight were spending more on technology, which the Resolution Foundation said will help maintain the success of the living wage. 09:07 Osborne vows to build 'global-facing Britain' \nA closer trading relationship with the United States could be possible as a result of Brexit, George Osborne indicated as he vowed to build a “global-facing Britain”.The Chancellor, who is heading to New York for talks with major investors, said he wanted to begin discussions with members of the North American Free Trade Agreement bloc - the US, Canada and Mexico - about forging stronger ties.Mr Osborne has a busy schedule over the coming weeks, with a trade visit to Asia also planned in an effort to promote investment in the UK amid fears that leaving the EU could make the country less attractive to foreign firms.The Chancellor said that although the UK is leaving the EU, “we are not withdrawing from the world” and for the first time since joining the EU it “will be setting its own trade terms”. 09:04 Businessman taken for a ride by Uber after being hit with £60 fare \nInteresting tale from our news team this morning about businessman, Ed Blackbird, being charged more than four times his normal taxi fare - £60.33 for a six mile trip. Find out why here: http://bit.ly/29AZLZs 9:00 Star Wars film studio doubles profits \nJames Bond and Star Wars have helped Pinewood Group more than double its annual profits, with the film studio saying the plunge in sterling following the EU referendum would also give it a boost.Revenues at Pinewood grew 10.9% to £83.2 million last year while operating profit soared 136.3% to £13.6 million.Star Wars: The Force Awakens and James Bond’s latest incarnation in Spectre, filmed at its studios, saw the firm cash in on two of the largest grossing movies of last year.Britain’s exit from the European Union will be “largely mitigated” as its most significant customers are US based, Pinewood said.Chief executive Ivan Dunleavy said: “The result of the UK’s referendum on membership of the EU is now known. In the context of our business, the decline in the sterling exchange rate is undoubtedly positive for our international customers.”Mr Dunleavy also said that five new sound stages are now operational, meaning its Buckinghamshire site now has capacity to take on two more blockbusters a year.In February, Pinewood hired Rothschild to conduct a strategic review, which could conclude with the firm’s sale for more than £250 million. Pinewood said the review is “ongoing”. 08:56 Record turnover for Darlington's Subsea Innovation \nOffshore supplier Subsea Innovation achieved record turnover in the year ended December 31, 2015. \nResults for the period show the figure rose 22% year-on-year, from £9.3m to £11.3m. \nOperating profit, meanwhile, came in at £339,000, up significantly from the previous year’s loss of £190,000. \nA strategic report said: “The group was successful in securing work across its full range of products throughout 2014 and 2015, enabling it to produce a record level of turnover, 22% above that of 2014. \n“This was despite the challenging market conditions.” 08:49 May's plan for big business shake-up for 'everyone - not just the privileged few' \nTheresa May will promise to put workers on the boards of major companies and curb excess corporate pay as she sets out her plan for a Britain that “works for everyone - not just the privileged few”.In the first event of a nationwide campaign to win over Tory members in her bid to become prime minister, Mrs May will say that under her leadership the Conservative Party will put itself “at the service” of working people.Setting out plans to change the way big businesses are governed, Mrs May will say consumers and workers should have places on their boards. 08:40 Boost for EE customers post-merger \nEE is to give pay monthly customers six months free access to the BT Sport app, as the mobile operator promotes its merger with the telecoms giant for the first time.From July 27, any new and existing EE customers on pay monthly plans for a smartphone or tablet will be able to access the BT Sport app and all its channels from their device.BT completed a £12.5 billion merger with EE earlier this year, with the mobile operator joining the BT Group but retaining its own brand.The new offer will enable users to watch Premier League and Champions League football as well as Premiership rugby on WiFi or over the mobile firm’s 4G network. 08:38 Staying on that Brexit theme... \nThe NFU has kicked off the UK’s biggest consultation on what the British farming industry will look like outside the EU \nKeen to grasp the earliest opportunity to engage with members on the issue, the organisation’s officeholder team discussed the impact of Brexit and took questions at the two-day Livestock 2016 event this week. \nA consultation focused on the future of farming in light of the ‘out’ vote will now run throughout the summer. \nHere’s our full story: http://bit.ly/29s2mlm 08:32 ...But business confidence slumps amid Brexit uncertainty, another report suggests \nThe UK economy is showing signs of stuttering amid mounting uncertainty following Britain’s vote to leave the EU, according to a report.Business optimism and output have slumped to three-year lows for the second month running under the weight of Brexit concerns, according to accountants BDO.The firm’s business trends report revealed that business output, which reflects company orders for the next three months, slipped to 99 last month, compared to 99.7 in May and 100.6 in April.It said business optimism also took a hit, falling to 98.9 in June from 99.4 in May, with UK manufacturing holding the bleakest outlook for future trade.Peter Hemington, partner at BDO LLP, said while Brexit has impacted investment in the UK economy, the slowdown was already in full swing when the vote took place.He said: “In all likelihood, whatever arrangements the UK eventually arrives at with the EU won’t look very different from what we have at the moment. So businesses cannot afford to get caught up in the hysteria. They need to hold their nerve and continue to invest in the UK.“We are at a crucial moment where we must be sensible in protecting the UK economy. We need a plan of action now that gives businesses the added confidence to progress with investment plans.” 08:28 Consumer confidence holding steady in wake of Brexit vote, says Barclaycard \nConsumers’ spending increased in the week after the EU referendum - but there were signs of shoppers adopting a more cautious mind-set - according to data from Barclaycard.Between June 24 and June 30, there was a 2.14% increase in consumer spending compared with the previous week, suggesting that many consumers avoided a knee-jerk reaction to the Brexit vote, its report said.However, those behind the report pointed out that spending often tends to go up towards the end of any month, as it coincides with payday for many people.There was also some mixed underlying news, as people appeared to have reined in their spending in pubs and restaurants towards the end of last month. 08:17 Robert Gibson-NEC GoRaise secures £600,000 of investment \nNewcastle-based fundraising platform GoRaise has received a £600,000 investment from Northstar Ventures and an angel investor. \nGoRaise is an online charity cashback platform which facilitates fundraising opportunities for individuals and organisations. \nFounder Gary Thompson said: “The capital of Northstar’s investment will be deployed to raise awareness of the platform and to ensure that the product continues to be an incredibly simple and frictionless process for all users. \n“We also have some exciting products in the pipeline to help the business community and event challengers (such as marathon runners) to raise money. \n“We’re currently on the lookout for new hires to fill roles in marketing, web development and community management. GoRaise will also be rolled out in the USA, Australia, France and Germany.” 08:15 Robert Gibson-NEC New Quantum Pharma product focuses on alleviating side effects of cancer treatment \nThe Burnopfield-based Quantum Pharma plc has launched a new product. \nThe Mucodis Dermal Spray, developed through Colonis, part of the firm’s Niche Pharmaceuticals division, is among a range of in-licensed patented medical devices focused on treating some of the side effects experienced by patients undergoing cancer treatment. \nChief executive Andrew Scaife said: “Radiodermatitis is an unpleasant and painful side effect of cancer treatment and we are delighted to launch Mucodis Dermal Spray to help treat these symptoms. \n“We are excited by the potential that the Mucodis range offers the NHS and patients. \n“There is a clear unmet need for this type of relief and we are confident that our products will have a significant effect on improving the patient’s quality of life.” Quantum Pharma - Aseptic suite 8:05am Robert Gibson-NEC 'Continued progress' for Northern Bear plc \nThe Newcastle-based specialist building firm Northern Bear plc has enjoyed another year of “continued progress”. Preliminary results for the year ended March 31, 2016, show that, while the company’s turnover dropped year-on-year from £41.7m to £36.5m, profit before tax remained static at £1.9m. \nThe performance led to a significant decrease in net bank debt, from £4.8m to £2.5m, Northern Bear is proposing its final dividend be raised from 1.5p to 2p per share. \nExecutive chairman Steve Roberts said: “The results for the year ended March 31, 2016, were in line with the excellent achievements in the previous year. \n“This has resulted in a further significant decrease in bank debt, which will allow us to continue with a progressive dividend policy for the benefit of shareholders. \n“We are very pleased with the continued progress, particularly given the impact of weather conditions on our ability to trade on site in the second half of the year, and would once again like to thank our staff for all their hard work and commitment.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-11T09:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-11T22:11:45.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
