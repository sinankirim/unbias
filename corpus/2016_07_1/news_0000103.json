ConservatoriesVince Lord, director of long-established Leicester firm Abbey Windows, confirmed a surge of inquiries into replacement windows and conservatory extensions, estimated to add 15 per cent on to the value of your home.\"We have received a huge number of inquiries so far this month, almost reaching the total we had throughout the whole of July 2015,\" he said.\"The inquiries are tending to come in for the bigger items and we currently have almost double the number of conservatory installations in our system.\"Damian Dewhirst, of Dewhirst Kitchens, reported buoyant sales, with customers preferring to add value to their current home instead of moving.He said: \"Sales are definitely up and customers are saying they would rather spend the money on installing a good-quality kitchen than pay the stamp duty on a Â£500,000-plus home.\"Market experts have predicted a short-term fall in property values with the overall impact on the market still to be determined by the outcome of negotiations on the UK's exit.The RICS UK Residential Market Survey for June indicated current uncertainty had resulted in a marked drop in housing market activity, with buyer inquiries falling for the third consecutive month.Best advice continues to be to sit tight and see, since property investment should always be looked at as a long-term investment.Kevin Newby, of Glenfield- agency Newby and Co, confirmed a drop in inquiries due to the uncertainty generated by Brexit.\"Despite the current state of play, I see this as very short term situation,'' he said.\"There has been a long period of shortage of supply and low interest rates, which has caused prices to go up and some properties to be over-valued, which may now see a slight correction.\"But I personally expect the market to pick up again within the next few months.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-21T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-21T15:36:05.090+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
