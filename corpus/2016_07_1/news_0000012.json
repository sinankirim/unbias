about money, a report has found. \nWhen asked: “Do you ever worry about money?”, 33% of youngsters aged between eight and 15 said they did - and boys appear more likely to pick up on their parents’ financial concerns than girls - Halifax found.Despite boys receiving more weekly pocket money than girls on average, at £6.93 versus £6.16 for girls, 37% of boys worry about money, compared with 30% of girls.When similar research was carried out 12 months ago, there was no particular gender divide, Halifax said.Giles Martin, head of Halifax Savings, said: “It is concerning that one in three children worry about money. \n“This is likely to be a reflection of young people picking up on their parents’ financial anxieties and shows how money issues continue to affect many families.” 08:55 Robert Gibson-NEC Contract win for Advantex \nGateshead IT firm Advantex is eyeing further growth for its Internet Protocol (IP) telephony business after the latest contract win to supply and install a new system. \nThe Sunderland-based business management specialists RTC North has opted for a new five-figure Mitel phone system to operate on a newly installed data infrastructure, also supplied by Advantex. \nThe standalone system will plug into the benefits for internet connectivity to provide low cost, fast and reliable telecommunications services for 70 users at RTC’s Loftus House head office on Colima Avenue. \nWith future growth anticipated, the new system will also provide reliable connectivity to other RTC sites across the UK along with remote tele-workers. \nIt will likewise improve the recording and reporting of customer calls for quality control and training purposes. \nRTC IT manager Michael Ball said: “Advantex’s solution will not only deliver long term cost savings but ensure high quality communications are an integral part of improving customer service levels as our operations and team expand.” From left, RTCs Michael Ball and Tracy Cornwell with Andy Shannon from Advantex 08:45 Robert Gibson-NEC Sage: the North's digital leader \nOk, so here at Journal Business, we bang on about it all the time - Sage this, Sage that... \nBut a new report has highlighted the market-leading position of the business software giant. \nTech investment bank GP Bullhound also has sweet things to say about the splendid folks at Performance Horizon, who are quietly taking over the world. \nOr something like that... http://bit.ly/2a0ndi0 Stephen Kelly 08:41 Robert Gibson-NEC Postal workers warn of 'crisis' \nPostal workers will today deliver a warning to the Government that the Post Office is in “crisis” because of closures and privatisation.The Communication Workers Union will parade a giant 20-foot postcard outside the headquarters of the Business Department in London calling for help to protect high streets across the country.The union has called a strike ballot among its members in response to job losses and branch closures.General secretary Dave Ward said: “Our Post Office is in crisis. Closures and privatisation are rife, thousands of jobs are being lost and millions of pounds of public money is being misspent by the gross mismanagement of company bosses.”A Post Office spokesman, however, said the CWU’s comments were “misleading”. It has been claimed the Post Office is in 'crisis' because of closures and privatisation 08:35 Robert Gibson-NEC Government urged to fund low-carbon projects in former industrial communities \nGovernment support for new low-carbon industries should be targeted at communities hit by the demise of heavy industry, says a new report.The TUC called for a Government agency to fund energy research and support projects such as new nuclear power stations and offshore wind.The UK could undergo a clean energy transition to create high-quality jobs in an industry worth hundreds of billions of pounds globally, said the report.TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: “[Business Secretary] Greg Clark’s new department must seize the opportunity and use green tech to deliver great new jobs.“Combining climate change and industrial policy in one department is an opportunity to get a share of the 500bn dollar (£378 billion) renewable energy industry for the UK.“As energy from oil and coal gets more expensive, manufacturing firms will instead invest in countries with a plentiful supply of low-carbon energy.“So the Government must put investment in low-carbon industry at the heart of its new industrial strategy.“It must focus that investment on towns that have lost their heavy industry, where decent jobs are still in short supply.” 08:27 Robert Gibson-NEC Ashley to blame for 'appalling working practices' at Sports Direct, says report \nSports Direct boss Mike Ashley is responsible for “appalling working practices” at Sports Direct, a damning report by MPs has concluded. \nThey said he was to blame “either for not knowing about them, or for turning a blind eye to such practices in the interests of maximising the revenue of Sports Direct”.

I am particularly pleased with the profit growth in both Estate Agency and Surveying. \n“Whilst the vote to leave the EU has created uncertainty in the property market, and has impacted consumer confidence, mortgage cost and availability remain positive for the UK housing market. \n“LSL has very strong fundamentals, with a robust balance sheet and a balanced business portfolio including its counter-cyclical Asset Management business. “The business is well positioned to adapt quickly to these changing market conditions and I am confident that it will continue to deliver long term value to shareholders.” 08:02 Robert Gibson-NEC Strong interims for LSL... but full-year figures could be hit by Brexit \nNewcastle’s LSL Property Services plc says expects to report strong interim results on August 2 - but has expressed doubt about full-year figures, given the impact of the Brexit vote. \nThe company, which runs businesses such as Your Move and Reeds Rains, has delivered growth across all major revenue lines. \nProfits are likewise up in both the Estate Agency and Surveying divisions. \nA trading update, however, said EU referendum outcome had led to further consumer uncertainty and that trading performance since had reflected these market conditions. \nIt said: “Whilst it is difficult to accurately predict the market conditions and consumer sentiment for the remainder of calendar 2016, LSL does not expect market conditions to improve sufficiently to meet the Board’s expectations for the full year. \n“Consequently, whilst still expecting growth in profitability in the second half of 2016 as compared to the first half of 2016, LSL now expects that full year Group Operating profit will be significantly lower than previously anticipated.” \nLSL will provide a further update with its interim results on 2 August 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-22T09:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-22T13:15:08.549+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
