Revenues for the period rose by 2 per cent to £163 million. \nMr Tom said integration planning for Breedon's acquisition of Hope Construction Materials was \"well advanced\", with completion of the deal expected on August 1 subject to final CMA clearance . \nBreedon announced its intention to acquire Hope Construction for £336 million last November. \nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) warned the takeover could result in a \"substantial lessening of competition\" in the ready-mix market, meaning Breedon has had to sell off some of its ready-mix plants to get final CMA clearance for the deal. \nRead more: Breedon boss buoyed by construction pick-up \nMr Tom said: \"The strategic rationale of the acquisition of Hope remains compelling and it will present new opportunities to deliver self-help improvements. \n\"It will also give us an even stronger platform for growth through a broader geographical footprint, increased scale, improved product mix, greater financial capacity and some highly talented people. \n\"We fully intend to use this strengthened platform to continue to pursue our strategy of consolidating the UK building materials market. \n\"Against this background we remain confident of meeting 2016 market expectations. \n\"We have some major contracts which will help to underpin our performance during a period of uncertainty, along with a strong balance sheet and a record of strong cash generation in challenging markets. We have also demonstrated our ability to deliver a strong performance through determined self-help and we will maintain this discipline irrespective of market conditions.\" \nBreedon operates more than 50 quarries, close to 30 asphalt plants, over 60 ready-mixed concrete plants and three concrete block plants in England, Wales and Scotland and employs around 1,200 people. \nThe group has strong asset backing, with over 500 million tonnes of mineral reserves and resources in the UK. \nBreedon Aggregates is in the process of changing its name to Breedon Group.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-21T11:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-21T15:36:55.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
