We’ve had talks of EU funding for programmes and whether that will continue for two years, and will it be replaced by Central Government. \n“So times are uncertain. How are these high level indicators going to play out for us? \n“All you can do is keep up with positive management and keep a strong cash balance in the business, but as a company we could have done without it – having only just clawed out of the recession.” \nThe firm develops commercial and residential properties and has offices in Yorkshire, Cumbria and Scotland. During 2015 Esh Build completed a number of exciting projects, including the £5.4m Thirteen headquarters in Stockton, £7.4m STEM Skills Centre at Middlesbrough College, £3.3m Boho Five in Middlesbrough and £1.3m Excelsior Academy in Newcastle. \nThe group, which employs more than 1,200 people across the North and Scotland, won significant work including a 10-year contract to carry out work for Northumbrian Water. \nThe group’s Esh Property Services business was also appointed to the four-year Broadacres Framework, a £160m scheme which involves the construction of 1,600 homes in the North East and Yorkshire over four years. \nDevelopment performance with Esh Homes and Esh Developments improved in 2015, as planning permission was secured for 450 houses and retail development at Philadelphia in Sunderland , which will start in 2016 and provide revenues from 2017 onwards. \nThe Esh share scheme, which includes 180 employees, has delivered significant gains to date. Further rewards for management and employees are also in place to recognise hard work and performance. \nShareholders were also told of work carried out by Esh Charitable Trust and Esh Added Value – the two supporting parts of Esh Group’s community work. \nThe platforms supported the national award winning Building My Skills initiative which introduces school children, sixth form and university students to employability skills and leads them into work experience, apprenticeship and job opportunities. \nThe scheme involves 103 business partners, 71 schools and more than 7,000 students. \nEsh Communities – Esh Group’s financial support platform for community projects – delivered more than £40,000 in grants to 39 projects, including 12 in the North East. \nThe business aims to increase grants delivered to £50,000 across 50 projects in 2016. \nMr Manning added: “These results show a successful, diversified strategy which is working not just to the benefit of our own employees, supply chain and customers but also the communities in which we operate. \n“The construction industry is showing signs of sustained recovery and with our strong cash position, Esh Group is well positioned to lead the new opportunities with our partners once areas such as devolution and the EU are more settled.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-13T02:36:48.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
