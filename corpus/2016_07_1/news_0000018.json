Tory MPs rising to their feet for a standing ovation while most Labour MPs remained seated and put their hands together, although SNP MPs refused to clap. \nHe then visited Buckingham Palace to stand down as Prime Minister after six years. Theresa May, the former Home Secretary, had a separate private audience with the Queen, and began her work as Mr Cameron’s replacement. Newcastle East MP Nick Brown, talks about his life as an MP \nNick Brown , Labour MP for Newcastle East, called on Theresa May to appoint a minister with responsibility for ensuring the North East regional economy grows. \nHe said: “I would really like Theresa May’s Government to take direct responsibility for economic development in the English regions and to devise a structure that works for the North of England. \n“What is needed is direct Ministerial leadership. David Cameron never provided this.” Read More Can Jeremy Corbyn beat Angela Eagle - and where do North East MP's loyalties lie? \nAnd he criticised Mr Cameron’s focus on the creation of a mayor-led regional combined authority. \nMr Brown said: “His main policy initiative was essentially local Government restructuring rather than focusing on central Government’s responsibility to push back against the natural drift of economic activity to London and the South East.” Catherine McKinnell, MP for Newcastle upon Tyne North \nCatherine McKinnell , Labour MP for Newcastle North, said: “This is obviously an historic day for Britain with a new female Prime Minister, but Cameron is leaving the country in a significant mess of his own making. \n“Whether the new PM will show any greater interest in the North East than the last one remains to be seen. \n“Cameron’s legacy for our region is certainly not a happy one, and the impact of his Government’s disproportionate cuts will be felt by communities across the North East for many years to come.” \nHowever, there was a glowing verdict from Mr Opperman, Conservative MP for Hexham. \nHe said David Cameron was “British to his fingertips, and is passionate about all the United Kingdom.” \nMr Opperman said: “He is a ‘one nation’ Conservative, proud of modernising the Conservative Party, leading it back into power in 2010 as the head of a coalition, after 13 years in the wilderness and winning an outright victory in the 2015 election, that many thought he would lose. \n“He is proud of restoring the country to economic stability after the 2008 crash and fighting for unpopular causes in the party, including gay marriage and international development.” Video loading Click to play Tap to play The Live Event you are trying to watch is either unavailable or has not started Please refresh this page in your browser to reload this live event video \nMrs May has already issued a promise to support economic growth across the UK, saying in a speech on Monday she wanted “a proper industrial strategy to get the whole economy firing, and a plan to help not one or even two of our great regional cities but every single one of them.” \nIn his final bout of Commons questions in the role of Prime Minister, Mr Cameron mocked Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who faces a leadership challenge, comparing him to the Black Knight character in the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail. \nThe comedy character has their limbs hacked off in a swordfight but carries on fighting, insisting “it’s just a flesh wound”. \nMr Corbyn, in turn, pointed out that Mrs May had once complained of workers “exploited by unscrupulous bosses” - implying that she had been talking about Mr Cameron. Read More Theresa May will become new Prime Minister on Wednesday as Leadsom quits \nBut the two party leaders ended on a warm note, as Mr Corbyn paid tribute to Mr Cameron’s wife, Samantha, who was watching events in the Commons public gallery with their children. \nMr Cameron also insisted he loved the Number 10 cat, Larry, following newspaper reports that he wasn’t fond of the feline - and even held up a photograph showing Larry sitting in his lap. \nMrs May, Britain’s second female PM, will swiftly begin drawing up her new top team and is expected to increase the number of women in Government as well as appointing a Cabinet-rank minister at the head of a new Brexit department to oversee the process of withdrawal from the EU. \nAlthough a Remain supporter, Mrs May has repeatedly stressed that “Brexit means Brexit” and the hunt for a building to house the department is already under way. \nAfter presenting herself as the unity candidate, the incoming leader is expected to offer plum posts to leading figures from both camps in the EU referendum.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-14T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-14T08:13:52.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
