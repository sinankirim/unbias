Red is energising and my favourite colour. \nIt's a fun car and I can only get one other person in it which means I'm never asked to be the designated driver. Related content \nI do 20,000 business miles a year and the diesel is nippy and comfortable and averages 65 mpg. It also matches my handbag and watch! \nWhat should be new Prime Minister Theresa May's key priorities over the next few months? \nTheresa May needs to build her cabinet into a strong cohesive high performing team. \nA team which can win the confidence of the nation and know what is best for the country they represent and is not built on the positioning of individual politicians. \nShe needs to be considered, positive and strong. \nDo you think having our second female PM will have any impact on gender inequality? \nA hundred years ago, women in the UK did not have the vote. Today we have a second female prime minister. \nThis is progress and Theresa May will have a positive impact as have Hillary Clinton, Angela Merkel and Nicola Sturgeon. \nHow can the Labour party fix its leadership crisis and can it become a strong opposition? \nThe Labour party needs a leader its members can believe in and get behind â€“ David Miliband? \nSome suggest the UK economy will go into recession after the Brexit vote. What is your advice to business managers? \nBusiness leaders need to stick to their guns, make clear choices and don't stall. \nWhat is your advice to professional Jamie Vardy lookalike Lee Chapman who said his life has been ruined after England crashed out of Euro 2016? \nIn short, s**t happens. We all need to be able to concentrate on the positive and be prepared to reinvent ourselves when faced with challenging situations. \nWhat now for new Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson? \nBoris understands the power of visibility/exposure and it has put him where he is now. \nHe obviously knows how to win friends and influence people. \nHe's a great salesman and now needs to apply these skills on behalf of Britain.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-19T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-19T07:46:22.539+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
