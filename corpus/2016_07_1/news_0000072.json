the UK out of the EU, says the SNP’s Angus Robertson, saying that he won’t be getting applause from the SNP for taking Scotland to the brink of leaving against their will. 12:45 Tom Eden Cameron concludes debate with Corbyn \nDavid Cameron thanks Corbyn for his praise of his family, saying: “The pressure often bears hardest on those around us.” \nAs he rounds off his exchange with Jeremy Corbyn he says he’s taken 5,500 questions and the dispatch box and given 92 hours of statements. \n“I’ll leave it to others to say how many I’ve answered,” he jokes. \nAnd that’s it for the PMQs sparring between the two, as Cameron rides off into the sunset. 12:41 Tom Eden Is Cameron heading for strictly? \nHe also sends wishes to Samantha and children — as it’s politicians’ loved ones who often bear the biggest burden — and asks if the PM will be filling the new vacancy on Strictly Come Dancing. \nThe PM confirms he’s not. 12:38 Corbyn's final question to Cameron is about ties \nJeremy Corbyn has put 179 questions and is now putting his 180th and final one. \nHe defiantly says that he has got plenty more to come for his successor. \nHe jokes “I would like to pass on my thanks to his mum for her advice about ties and suits and songs. \n“I’m reflecting on the lesson she offered.” \nHe seemed to enjoy this gag: 12:36 Tom Eden 'Beware Tom Watson' \nDavid Cameron reads out his own email - from a lady called Judith on 16 September 2015. \nShe asked him to not be triumphant in his first PMQs against Corbyn, because Tom Watson was more formidable. \nShe claimed “Tom Watson who may oust Jeremy Corbyn” was “experienced, organised and far more dangerous in the long term.” \nHe jokes: “I’ve got to find Judith and find out what on earth happens next!” 12:34 Tom Eden What happens to EU citizens living here? \nJeremy Corbyn gets cheers when he reads out an email from Nina - an EU citizen who is worried she will be chucked out after Brexit. \nThe PM says the Tories are “working hard” to guarantee her position but won’t give a cast iron pledge. \n“The only circumstance I can envisage a future government trying to undo that guarantee would be if British citizens in other countries didn’t have their rights respected. \n“There must be reciprocity.” Tom Eden Cameron launches into a Monty Python jibe \nAs, once again the PM is asked about failures in the economy, Cameron responds by talking about what he thinks the government has done to tackle workplace exploitation. \nAnd he replies with another jibe: \n“He’s reminding me of the black knight in Monty Python and the Holy Grail! \n“He’s been kicked so many times but he keeps saying keep going, it’s only a flesh wound!” 12:29 Tom Eden Will May tackle 'Agency Britain' \nIn his handover discussions, will there be any proposals to take on ‘Agency Britain’, ban zero-hour contracts and clamp down on umbrella companies? 12:27 Is Cameron an unscrupulous boss? \nSo who is that dodgy boss, Theresa? \nJeremy Corbyn jokes how Theresa May warned about people being “exploited by unscrupulous bosses”. \nThe House of Commons errupt in laughter, with the camera turning to the incoming PM and David Cameron, who both are laughing hard, as Mr Corbyn asks - “I wonder who she could mean?” 12:25 Tom Eden Corbyn: 'I’m enjoying every moment' \nDavid Cameron jokes it’s rich of Mr Corbyn to accuse him of “sloth in delivery”. \n“We’ve had resignation, competition and coronation - they haven’t even decided what the rules are yet!” he says. \n“If they ever got into power it would take about a year to decide who sits where!” \nMr Corbyn replies: “Democracy is an exciting and splendid thing and I’m enjoying every moment of it.” 12:23 Cameron accused of 'malaise' \nCorbyn returns to the dispatch box to ask his third question. \nHe says there is a “malaise” in the economy, once again using what Theresa May has said. \nHowever, Cameron responds with a now-well-rehearsed list of achievements by the government. 12:21 'We are making good progress' \nOn the issue of housing, Cameron continues, the question of affordability is key. \n“We are making good progress.” 12:19 Tom Eden Cameron congratulates Theresa May \nCameron takes the opportunity to congratulate the current home secretary in becoming the next prime minister, to cheers from the Tories. \nMocking Labour’s record on female leaders, he jokes: “It’s 2-0, and not a pink bus in sight.” 12:17 Tom Eden Why can't young people buy homes? \nTurning to Theresa May’s comments in her ascention be becoming the next PM, Corbyn references her saying that it’s harder for ever for young people to buy their own home. \nIs this because of record low house-building or the government’s apparent belief that £450,000 is apparently an ‘affordable home’? 12:14 Tom Eden Cameron responds to question about homelessness \nCameron thanks Corbyn for his kind words about both the cases, with a personal anecdote about gay marriage from someone who worked at Number 10, who told the prime minister of his happiness that he could finally marry the person he loved. \nTurning to the homelessness question, “The key is building more homes,” and a strong economy, says Cameron. 12:12 Tom Eden Corbyn on his feet \nCorbyn joins Cameron in congratulation the British tennis players at Wimbledon. He then says that, after six years as PM, it’s only right to thank Cameron for his service. \nHe welcomes release of a Guantanamo Bay prisoner and and equal marriage, quipping that he was helped by Labour votes (David Cameron faced quite strong opposition on the gay marriage bill from many of his own Conservative MPs) \nWould he express concern at the way homelessness has risen over the past six years? 12:07 Tom Eden Fist question \nThe first person to ask Cameron a question is Danny Kinahan , an Ulster Unionist MP, who thanks Cameron for his work including in Northern Ireland. He says there are other leadership roles out there, he tells Cameron: the England football team, Top Gear, the US presidency. \nPMQs is off to a light-hearted and less combative start... \nCameron thanks him for the suggestions, and reals off some of his achievements. 12:00 Tom Eden \nThe final PMQs of David Cameron’s premiership has begun. \nWe should have a live feed at the top of the page very shortly. 11:59 Tom Eden Who is asking questions? \nAside from Jeremy Corbyn, who gets six questions as the leader of the opposition (for now, at least), and Angus Roberson the SNP parliamentary leader, who gets three (as the third biggest party), backbench MPs are chosen in a random ballot to be called to ask the prime minister a question. \nHere’s who will be asking questions: Danny Kinahan (South Antrim) Graham Stringer (Blackley and Broughton) Jack Lopresti (Filton and Bradley Stoke) Adrian Bailey (West Bromwich West) Peter Lilley (Hitchin and Harpenden) Jo Churchill (Bury St Edmunds) Carol Monaghan (Glasgow North West) John Mc Nally (Falkirk) Margaret Ferrier (Rutherglen and Hamilton West) Steve Brine (Winchester) Ian Blackford (Ross, Skye and Lochaber) Robin Walker (Worcester)", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-13T13:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-13T15:05:20.282+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
