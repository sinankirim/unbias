in which she promised that Scotland would have a voice in EU talks. \nCoun Watson said exports would be vital to the UK as we left the European Union and that meant the Government should support the North East, the only region in the UK with a consistent positive balance of trade. \nHe is one of a number of northern leaders to write to Mrs May demanding a place at the Brexit negotiating table. \nLeaders of five northern Combined Authorities joined forces to make clear that with an economy stronger than that of Scotland’s and a population greater than London’s, the North of England should not be ignored. British Prime Minister Theresa May (L) meets with Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in Edinburgh to discuss the UK's Brexit negotiations \nChairs or leaders of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, Liverpool City Region Combined Authority, Sheffield City Region Combined Authority and West Yorkshire Combined Authority also signed the letter inviting Mrs May “to meet with us at your earliest convenience to discuss our role within the Brexit negotiations and how we can work together for the benefit of the North.” \nCoun Watson said: “The Northern Powerhouse is squeezed between what is becoming a very powerful Scotland and what was always a very powerful south, particularly the south east. \n“So it’s important our voice is heard in terms of our strengths and our interests.” \nEU funding for the North East would come to an end and it was important to discuss what would replace it, he said. \n“Clearly there will be something that replaces state aid and these are very important issues for the north east of England and the north as a whole.” \nIt was also important to ensure manufacturers such as Nissan with facilities in the North East continued to have access to EU markets, he said. \n“We really need to have as fair a deal as possible and as good a deal as possible for the north of England. \n“We need our voice to be heard at that table. We have some special interests and for too long we haven’t been able to influence clearly in that forum.” \nHe added: “If it is going to be an export-led recovery then they need to listen to the people who are in the areas that can drive that.” \nThe plea from council leaders was backed by Newcastle upon Tyne North MP Catherine McKinnell . \nShe said: “Britain leaving the EU will have a profound effect on the North East, and it is clearly vital that our voice is heard as loudly as anyone else’s throughout this process. \n“I totally agree that the new Prime Minister must include the North throughout this negotiation, if we are to have any chance of getting the best possible outcome from what was a very disappointing referendum result.” \nLeading think tank IPPR North said the north had as much right to be heard as Scotland. \nIPPR North director Ed Cox said: “The North of England has a population of 15 million and an economy worth £300 billion - twice that of Scotland - and so it is right that northern leaders should demand a place at the Brexit negotiating table and a North First approach to investment. \n“The city leaders should be mindful though that it was outside the big cities that the strength of the Leave vote was strongest and for the Northern Powerhouse initiative to prosper, greater thought must be given to how the north speaks with a more inclusive voice and develops a more joined-up economic plan.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-19T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-19T07:54:59.200+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
