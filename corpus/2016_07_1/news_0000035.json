Last year’s General Election is like ancient history. Everything has changed. \nDavid Cameron increased his share of the popular vote and re-elected with more seats in a rare achievement for any sitting Prime Minister. Yet a year later he resigns. \nCameron was the Almost Prime Minister. Despite six years in Number 10, he never really got things off the ground. Most of his time was spent in an awkward coalition with the Liberal Democrats that hampered Cameron’s ability to drive his vision of a Tory Britain. \nAs the 2015 General Election approached, Cameron nervously saw the rise of UKIP and feared it could lead to another coalition deal or even Ed Miliband’s Labour Party forming the next government. So Cameron made a Faustian deal with the public that sold his political soul for much less than its worth. \nCameron promised a referendum on the UK’s membership of the EU knowing a majority unlikely. This was a promise easily made and not to be delivered. But Cameron won it anyway leading Britain into a referendum few outside Tory backbenches or UKIP pub crawls wanted. \nHis legacy is a trail of missed opportunities. Cameron supported austerity to cut the deficit and reduce borrowing. A sluggish economy meant the Government received less than expected in tax and so deficit targets kept getting missed while borrowing continued to grow. And the biggest cuts are all yet to come. \nCameron wanted to foster a Big Society reducing the size and cost of the state. We saw a Big Flop instead – at least four launches where even its founding ennobled tsar lacked the time to make it work. \nHe has left a country at ill-ease with itself. The political establishment won the battle against Scotland’s independence while strengthening the hand of the SNP. \nAnd then the establishment snatched failure from the jaws of victory in losing a Brexit vote that need never have been called. If only we knew what the polls got wrong – Cameron never needed to make the referendum promise to get his majority after all. When Leave won the vote, it seems everyone took it literally. Cameron left the political stage – and Brexit campaigners tripped over each other to quit their positions so they would never have to make a plan for what they promised. Abdication of responsibility left the public in the dark. \nThis lack of leadership from the Government and Brexit campaigners has been enormously damaging. Race-hate attacks are not new, but they have increased. Violent threats and abuse of politicians didn’t start this summer – yet Jo Cox’s assassination was the first murder of an MP since 1990. \nShortly after the Leave vote, I was asked if I was ‘safe’. When I asked what he meant, I was told: “We’ve voted Leave so you’ve got to go.” While I am a British citizen, I was born in the United States and have dual citizenship – my accent clearly makes me sound like a foreigner and people had started to ask me when I was packing my bags. \nThis confusion makes clear that people voting for Brexit wanted different things. Some want immigration to drop significantly – perhaps a minority expected deportations like with my conversation. Others wanted Britain to ‘take back control’. But several vote Leave to send a sign of disapproval of the Government. \nPeople vote for several different reasons for a political party, too. The key difference is that parties have manifestos. We might not want everything promised to happen, but we can have a sense of what this package of promises looks like. Not so with Brexit. \nWe learned within hours of Leave winning that most, if not all, of the promises made about savings, public investment and immigration reforms were not going to happen – by the very people who promised for months that they would. \nI hope history looks back on the Leave promise that £350million per week would be spent on the NHS – plastered on the side of the official campaign bus – the same way we look at the Liberal Democrat promise on tuition fees. At least the Lib Dems did mean it when they said it. Read More What will Prime Minister Theresa May do about the Northern Powerhouse? \nTheresa May has now become our new Prime Minister. Appointments to her government are being announced as I write this column. In a long list of surprises in this reshuffle that shows Michael Gove how Machiavellian politics is to be done well, the biggest surprise is Boris Johnson as Foreign Secretary. \nBoris’s promotion has been met with the kind of bewilderment normally attributed to his clumsy hair style. He has no shortage of entertaining comments regularly crossing the lines of good sense and tactfulness. This earned him a lucrative career in journalism, but may prove deeply uncomfortable in his new role. \nMay is clearly taking a gamble on Boris, but I see this as a shrewd move. Boris quit the leadership race to become Prime Minister before entering it shortly after his greatest triumph in winning the referendum vote. If you wondered why he looked miserable in his ‘victory’ speech on June 24, it was because he knows deep down the game is up and the kind of Brexit he talked about will be very difficult to deliver in practice. \nMay’s making Boris Foreign Secretary means that his political success now rests on him becoming a respected and trusted working partner with world leaders and countries he has been slagging off for years. You could almost hear him gasp ‘cripes!’ followed by some incomprehensible ancient Greek on learning May has outsmarted and outmanoeuvred him. \nPutting chief Leave proponents like Boris in charge of Brexit, means they will have only themselves to blame if they get it wrong and fail to deliver on their promises. And Theresa May will walk away undamaged, perhaps even enhanced. \nFor everyone who wanted those who asked Britain to Leave to show us the plan they never produced during the campaign, now is their chance. The clock is ticking. Don’t be surprised if Boris asks us to reconsider before any Brexit is triggered. \nThom Brooks is Professor of Law and Government at Durham University.
