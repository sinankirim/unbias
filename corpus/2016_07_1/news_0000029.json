Regions that benefited most from EU funding, like the North East, were among those that resoundingly voted for Brexit. \nIn all, 1.34 million of us turned out to vote on June 23 - with 778,103 siding with leave and 562,595 with remain, meaning a resounding 58% voted for Brexit. \nHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: “The referendum has exposed the extent to which people in the poorest places feel shut out from the benefits of the country’s prosperity. \n“These figures show the challenge in ensuring they do not fall further behind from lost EU funding after 2020.” \nShe said, without action, initiatives such as the Northern Powerhouse “risk withering after Brexit”. \nCouncil leaders are seeking urgent assurances from the Government that town halls will still get the £5.3billion in EU regeneration funding allocated up to 2020. \nThe Local Government Association is assessing the impact Brexit will have on local communities at its annual conference in Bournemouth. \nLord Porter, LGA chairman, said: “Communities also need assurances from the Government that they will still receive billions of pounds worth of EU funding to create jobs and boost growth.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-06T08:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-06T09:08:39.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
