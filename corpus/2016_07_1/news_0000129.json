Jul 2016 By Robert Gibson-NEC The Journal Business team's live blog bringing you the morning's most important business and financial news   Barratt Homes \nGood morning and welcome to the Journal Business team's morning Live blog for Wednesday, July 13. \nI'm Robert Gibson and I'll be bringing you regular updates on all the breaking business news from across the North East. \nWe will have stories, pictures, tweets and comments covering the latest big stories from the region's business community, as well as national news, FTSE updates and stock exchange announcements from the Journal region's listed companies. \nIn this morning's news, housebuilder Barratt has reported another strong year, while the mighty Hedgehog Lab has been named best company to work for in Newcastle. \nI'm here all week, from 8am to 9.30am, taking you through the events to keep you informed as they break as well as giving you a flavour of what to expect from us news-wise over the course of the day. \nIf you'd like to contribute to the live blog, tweet at @jnlbusiness to share your stories, opinions and images. \nAlternatively you can drop me a line at robert.gibson@ncjmedia.co.uk or tweet me at @JournalGibson Key Events So Far 09:30 Robert Gibson-NEC Catch you tomorrow \nWell that’s it for the morning - apart from news-just-in that Pidgey is currently the most spotted Pokemon on Pokemon Go, according to Reddit. Have just had a press release confirming the bare details (Pidey has been mentioned 62 times on the subreddit, more than any other of the 151 original Pokemon). Our editorial teams will no doubt be all over this one today. \nI’ve also got a nice little automotive story to work as well as our Monday Interview - the charming and talented, Michaela Reaney of Gradvert. \nThe blog re-commences at 8am tomorrow. R 09:24 Robert Gibson-NEC Record year for Ramarketing \nNewcastle-based digital agency Ramarketing is celebrating a record year after successful overseas expansion. \nOver the last 12 months the company has increased turnover by 60%, doubled its headcount and won work in Denmark, Spain, Ireland, Sweden, Slovakia and the US. Raman Sehgal, founder of ramarketing 09:16 Robert Gibson-NEC ‘Social enterprises are at heart of Gateshead’s economic growth’, says councillor \nAt the Social Enterprise Summit to be held tomorrow to showcase and celebrate social enterprises in Gateshead, Cllr Gary Haley will say businesses that put people and communities first and reinvest their profits back into society are at the heart of economic growth in the area. \nCllr Gary Haley, who is Gateshead’s cabinet member for economy, will say: “We are delighted to be working with Social Enterprise UK, to celebrate social enterprise in Gateshead. As a council we have supported social enterprise development for more than 30 years and are very proud of the social enterprise journey and legacy in the borough. \n“Social enterprise is being increasingly acknowledged as a core economic driver, playing a central role in both social and economic regeneration and business growth, delivering much needed services, promoting inclusion, changing lives and providing employment.” 09:10 Robert Gibson-NEC Seven year hitch faces workers saving for retirement \nWorking-age Britons typically expect to spend seven years more saving for their retirement than those who are already pensioners, a report has found.On average, UK workers predict they will spend 37 years saving for their retirement - which was also the equal longest time found in any country in a global survey by HSBC. The Future of Retirement research compared UK retirement trends with those in 16 other countries, including the United States, France, Hong Kong, Canada, Singapore, China and India.People in the UK who have already retired said it took them around 30 years on average to save for their later years. 09:02 Robert Gibson-NEC Wetherspoons boss also talking Brexit... \nThe Brexit-backing chairman of JD Wetherspoon has lashed out at Chancellor George Osborne, the IMF, the Bank of England and a host of other organisations, blaming them for a potential slowdown following the EU referendum vote.Tim Martin called into question their honesty and economic judgment during the referendum campaign, also singling out the CBI, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and PwC, who he claims were too negative about the impact of a Leave vote.“In my opinion, the above individuals and organisations are either dishonest or they have a poor understanding of economics, since democracy and prosperity are closely linked and the EU is clearly undemocratic,” he said.“By voting to restore democracy in the UK, I believe the UK’s economic prospects will improve, although it is quite possible that the unprecedented and irresponsible doom-mongering, outlined above, may lead to some kind of slowdown.” JD Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin 08:57 Robert Gibson-NEC NE housing market buoyant - despite Brexit \nDespite the uncertainty fuelled by the EU Referendum coupled with the impact of the higher stamp duty now in place on investment property purchases, the North East’s housing market remains buoyant, according to the latest RICS Residential Market Survey. \nThe North East was the only UK region to report a rise in new buyer enquiries last month, with 12% of agents reporting an increase in interest from potential buyers, up from 8% back in May. \nMeanwhile, despite over 20% of chartered surveyors in the North East reporting a drop in the number of instructions (homes for sale) coming on to the market last month, 13% of respondents saw an increase in agreed sales. \nThe only other regions to report a rise in new sales during the month of June were Wales and Northern Ireland. \nSimon Rubinsohn, RICS Chief Economist, said: “Big events such as elections typically do unsettle markets so it is no surprise that the EU referendum has been associated with a downturn in activity. \n“However even without the build up to the vote and subsequent decision in favour of Brexit, it is likely that the housing numbers would have slowed during the second quarter of the year following the rush in many parts of the country from buy to let investors to secure purchases ahead of the tax changes. \n“RICS data does suggest that the softer tone to the market will persist over the coming months. But the critical influence, looking further ahead, is how the economy performs in the wake of the uncertainty triggered by the vote to leave.” Simon Rubinsohn, Chief Economist at RICS. 08:56 Robert Gibson-NEC Northumberland College signs agreement with Huawei \nNorthumberland College has signed a strategic agreement on talent development with Huawei, a leading global information and communications technology (ICT) solutions provider. \nThrough Huawei Academy certification training, the new partnership will combine industry and academic expertise to help enhance the skills and career prospects of students studying at Northumberland. \nShi Weiliang, Vice President of Huawei UK Enterprise Business Group, said: “We are very pleased to be partnering with Northumberland College to roll out the Huawei Academy program. \n“Our enterprise business has seen strong growth globally in recent years and we are very pleased that Northumberland is the first Further Education College to sign up. \n“As the digital landscape continues to evolve, we need to ensure the next generation of STEM students and engineers is equipped with the skills to help them succeed in the workplace of tomorrow. \n“The Huawei Academy Program helps to meet that need.” \nMarcus Clinton, Northumberland College Principal and Chief Executive, said: “This agreement will further establish standards in the IT networking and data security industries and means we’re able to offer students additional certification to enhance their job prospects.” Northumberland College Principal Marcus Clinton 08:49 Robert Gibson-NEC More good news for Nomad Digital \nFast-growing Nomad Digital has secured another global partnership. \nThe Newcastle company - the world’s leading provider of wireless connectivity and ICT solutions to the rail industry - has partnered with the international train builder Stadler to supply a passenger WiFi and infotainment solution for the new EC250 ‘Giruno’ high-speed trains being built for the Swiss state rail operator SBB. \nThese will travel across Switzerland, Italy, Germany and Austria. \nWe’ve got the full story here: http://bit.ly/29I72G9 Nomad Digital CEO Andrew Taylor 08:45 Robert Gibson-NEC 'Misleading' BMW ad banned \nAn ad for BMW has been banned for making the “misleading” claim that its high beam headlight technology prevented oncoming drivers from being dazzled.The radio ad for the BMW 1 series car said its High Beam Assist technology meant “oncoming traffic is never dazzled and you can keep your hands on the wheel and your eyes on the road”.The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) upheld a complaint that the claim was misleading and exaggerated the technology’s capabilities.It said: “We considered that a second of full beam light could potentially dazzle an oncoming driver at short distances, for example on a sharp bend.“Because of that, we considered that the claim ‘Oncoming traffic is never dazzled’ had not been substantiated and was misleading.”It ruled that the ad must not be broadcast again in its current form, adding: “We told BMW to ensure that in future their ads did not exaggerate the capability of the High Beam Assist technology.” 08:42 Robert Gibson-NEC Sales slip at Burberry \nBurberry has said that like-for-like sales slipped 3% in the first quarter, laying bare the challenges facing incoming chief executive Marco Gobbetti.The company said it faces “challenging and underlying cost inflation pressures”, adding that its outlook for the US in particular is “cautious”.Underlying turnover was flat at £423 million, with Asia, Europe, the Middle East and the Americas all showing a fall in retail sales.However, the pound’s fall in value since the EU referendum result means Burberry’s profits will be boosted to the tune of £90 million, up from the £50 million benefit pencilled in in April. \nOutgoing chief executive Christopher Bailey said: “In what remained a challenging external environment, underlying retail sales were flat in the first quarter.“In this context, we continue to focus on managing our business with agility whilst implementing the ambitious evolution of our strategies and ways of working we outlined in May, to position Burberry for long-term growth.” 08:35 Robert Gibson-NEC 'Exciting times' for NE logistics experts InBond \nNorth East logistics experts InBond have recruited new staff and apprentices after pushing turnover beyond £2m. \nNow the Stockton company is looking to open a second Teesside site as its management team eyes what it believes to be a huge opportunity for growth across the region. \nSpecialising in document management, warehousing, transport and product enhancement, InBond’s blue chip customers include the NHS, Next and Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies. \nHaving recently won a significant contract with a major housing organisation, it has increased its in-house team to 40 with the recruitment of five new staff together with apprentices Cory Roberts and Nicole Shaw. \nFinance director Craig Rye said: “These are exciting times for InBond. \n“We aim to continue to grow, create more jobs and invest in a new site - almost certainly on Teesside – within the next 12 months. Craig Rye, Finance Director at InBond, and Jessica Binns, InBond Customer Service Administrator 08:28 Scaife to seek new non-exec positions \nRemember yesterday’s news that Quantum Pharma’s Andrew Scaife is to step down as CEO? Well, he kindly shared his thoughts with us later in the day, explaining that he wanted to focus more on his family, while taking on more non-exec positions such as that which he already holds at Realsafe Technologies. Read all about it: http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/business/business-news/quantum-pharma-ceo-take-non-11605262 Andrew Scaife, CEO of Quantum Pharma 08:26 Recruitment drive as steel firm SCH secures new contracts \nNewton Aycliffe steel company SCH Site Services is looking to add at least eight new members of staff to its team after enjoying another turnover boost. SCH’s annual sales grew slightly to £4.8m, up from £4.5m in 2015, while it has also won a string of new contracts which is resulting in another recruitment drive. \nOperations director Andy Braid said “We’ve enjoyed a number of new contract wins in recent months which comes off the back of another record year for the company in terms of sales, so we’re delighted. “We’ve also employed two new office staff and we’re now looking to expand on the site side of the business to accommodate the recent contract wins which will keep us busy well into the Autumn.” 08:21 May to appoint Brexit minister \nTheresa May will make appointing a cabinet minister to take charge of Brexit one of her first tasks as she takes the keys to No 10.Britain’s new prime minister will swiftly begin drawing up her new top team and is expected to increase the number of women in government.David Cameron will take to the Despatch Box in the House of Commons for his last session of questions as PM in the House of Commons before the historic shift of power takes place.He is expected to make a statement in Downing Street highlighting how he has overseen Britain’s economic recovery, before heading to Buckingham Palace to offer his resignation.Mr Cameron told The Daily Telegraph it had been “a privilege to serve the country I love”.“I came into Downing Street to confront our problems as a country and lead people through difficult decisions so we could reach better times,” he said.“As I leave, I hope people will see a stronger country, a thriving economy, and more chances to get on in life. It has been a privilege to serve the country I love.” Theresa May 08:08 Hedgehog Lab - officially fab \nTechnology consultancy hedgehog lab is celebrating being named as best company to work for in Newcastle by independent review site Glassdoor.co.uk, scoring a perfect 5.0 out of 5.0 rating. \nGlassdoor gives both past and present employees the opportunity to anonymously and honestly rate their experiences of working at any given company. Consideration is given to things such as company culture, management, salaries and future career prospects. \nThe acknowledgement comes as the company continues to grow at a rapid rate - with revenues set to double in 2016. \nIt has also opened a second US office in Austin. \nCEO Sarat Pediredla said: “Given the potential that the US market has and the encouraging signs since opening in Boston and then expanding into Austin, we plan to grow there with a view to adding delivery teams and increasing our capabilities to better serve our partners.” Sarat Pediredla, MD of The Hedgehog Lab 08:02 Barratt confident after strong year - despite uncertainty due to EU referendum \nHousebuilder Barratt says it remains confident in the “positive fundamentals” of the sector and the business, despite uncertainty following the EU referendum. \nIn a trading update ahead of annual results for the year ended June 30, 2016, the company said total completions had increased 5% year-on-year to 16,447 as a results of strong consumer demand. \nProfit before tax, meanwhile, rose 20% to £680m in line with market expectations. \nDavid Thomas, chief executive said: “We have delivered another strong performance for the year. The disciplined growth in completion volumes reflects the strength of our sector leading build and sales teams. \n“Following the EU referendum, it is too early to say what the impact of the uncertainty facing the UK economy will be. \n“The sector continues to receive focused government support, mortgage availability is good and there remains an undersupply of new homes. \n“With a strong balance sheet and forward order book, and industry leading quality and customer service, we remain confident in the positive fundamentals of both the housing sector and our business.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-13T09:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-13T11:57:26.088+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
