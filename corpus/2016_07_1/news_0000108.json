for a number of reasons, including bearing down on congestion in London an dthe south east and making sure that opportunities and power are fairly distributed across the United Kingdom. The present government just isn’t doing so.” \nHe added: “The most significant single regional policy in the North East was under the EU structural fund. \n“Will at least this funding stream continue under the new arrangements? That is the immediate question for the two candidates to be leader of the Conservative Party.” Read More North East LEP calls on Government to ensure multi-million EU funding \nAnd Mr Morris said: “It’s essential to secure investment for our region in the wake of the Brexit result. Because for our region it is £400m worth of European structural fund and for us that’s incredibly important, because that helps to drive and maintain jobs and economic growth in the North East. \n“The Government have got to address he regional imbalances in terms of capital investment in infrastructure in the regions. \n“If the Government is serious about encouraging growth and sharing prosperity it is vital to protect that funding, and in fact they should go further.” \nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn raised the issue of investment in the North East in the House of Commons this week as he accused David Cameron of breaking his promise to build a Northern Powerhouse and said just 50p in every £100 of investment goes to the North East. \nThe Labour leader said: “This Government promised that they would rebalance our economy. They promised a Northern Powerhouse, yet half of 1% of infrastructure investment is going to the North East and London is getting 44 times more than that. \n“Is it not time to have a real rebalancing of our economy and to invest in the areas that are losing out so badly?”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-08T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-08T21:03:41.971+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
