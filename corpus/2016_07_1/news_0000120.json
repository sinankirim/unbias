X \nCopy link to paste in your message / \nAlberto Costa, the Conservative MP for South Leicestershire, has written the following article on why he is supporting Michael Gove for the Conservative Party leadership. \nHis views do not necessarily represent those of the Leicester Mercury. \nTwo weeks ago, I pledged to respect the result of the EU referendum. The voters of Leicestershire and almost half of Leicester chose to leave the EU. I respect that democratic decision and must now focus on the interests of the whole of our United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. \nAs a Leicestershire Conservative MP, my duty is to help select and passionately argue for the very best candidate to become the next Prime Minister of our country. \nMichael Gove is a principled, competent and experienced member of the British government. The right thing is for me to share with you as a local Leicestershire MP why I believe he is the right person to lead us. \nFollowing the historic referendum result, we need a leader who can unite our country with a bright, dynamic vision for our great nation's future. Michael's speech last Friday set out a very positive, uplifting and exciting vision for Great Britain. He pledges to focus on helping those most in need in our country; those who have not benefited from globalisation. The referendum result is testament that there are many of our citizens who feel they have been left behind. He understands this and his policies will set out a range of new programmes to help our nation's poorest people whilst building on the economic opportunities that Brexit may bring. \nRead more: Brexit vote puts millions of pounds of EU funds at risk \nI have also spoken to my predecessor the former MP for South Leicestershire, Lord Andrew Robathan, who I have the highest regard for and he said, \"I have worked with Michael in Parliament. When I was Shadow Deputy Chief Whip I formed the view which I still firmly hold that Michael is a very principled, conviction politician. He successfully led the Leave campaign which I supported and I believe that he is now best placed to unite our country with a bold new vision for Britain's future outside the EU\". I agree. \nMichael will be a leader who is committed to a new path for our nation and who can build and lead a united team to guide Leicestershire and the whole UK through the challenges ahead. \nThis county voted for change – and he will deliver it. Why? As Education Secretary, he changed our education system driving through a huge programme of reform. He is a conviction politician and believed that the right values and the right policies would transform children's lives for the better. He negotiated with the Treasury and was able to get more money for the poorest children, establish new schools, change teaching and exams, and most importantly get a million more of our country's children into good or outstanding schools. This is genuine achievement working at the heart of government. \nRead more: Leicester voters spoiled ballots by choosing BOTH Remain and Leave \nBut he has done so much more. I serve on Parliament's Justice Committee and have seen close up how Michael, as Justice Secretary, is positively changing our prisons and the justice system. He started the biggest programme of prison reform since Victorian times, with an investment of £1billion into new buildings; with prisoners put to work; and education facilities radically improved so that offenders get the qualifications they need. He has ensured the closure of decaying prisons; and has begun an overhaul of youth justice, in order that young people who come into contact with the criminal justice system do not fall into a life of crime. This is evidence of the positive and effective action he has already achieved in government. He can do much more across the whole of our public and private sectors if he is elected as our nation's leader. \nI owe it to the voters of South Leicestershire to acknowledge that he successfully led the case for change in the referendum campaign and is now the candidate who can best deliver that change.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-05T12:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-05T14:03:33.638+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
