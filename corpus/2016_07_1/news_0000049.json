That was brilliant.” \nIn particular, she had praise for the many youngsters in the cast. \n“There’s a lot of bad things written about kids these days. They get blamed for all sorts of things. \n“But you saw the kids in this show and they were absolutely fabulous. It makes you feel really proud.” \nSteven Thornton, pushing Gill’s wheelchair, said there had been no problem accessing the Kynren site. He praised the staff who he said couldn’t have been more helpful. \nGill had just one piece of advice for those planning to come to future performances: “Bring something warm!” \nAndrew Robson, cradling a sleeping three-year-old, Lucy, said after exiting the grandstand (called the ‘Tribune’): “That was absolutely fantastic. \n“The show was brilliant and the organisation was fantastic from start to finish. \n“We got our tickets last November and I suppose we didn’t expect that it would be as good as this. \n“We live in Bishop Auckland, just a few minutes away, and I think anything on this scale must be good for the town.” \nAndrew’s daughter Kaitlin, 13, said she had liked the scene showing Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations the best. \nKaitlin said Lucy had enjoyed the show too – until she fell asleep. She pointed out that you couldn’t reasonably expect a three-year-old to stay awake until after 11pm. \nThis was when the final fireworks signalled the end of the show – and of this telling of our history at the point when Winston Churchill exhorted the British people to “brace ourselves to our duties, and so bear ourselves, that if the British Empire and its Commonwealth last for a thousand years, men will still say, this was their finest hour”. \nIn a period of political turmoil, they were perhaps just what the doctor ordered. The applause was long and loud. \nThere were cries of “More!” – although you wondered what notable events might have been equal to those shown here. Thatcher? Brexit? Things to do this summer Visit a County Show 1 of 8 \nSaturday’s performance followed a dress rehearsal a couple of weeks ago attended by just the media and the team of volunteers gathered by Eleven Arches, the company behind Kynren which takes its name from the 11 arches of Bishop Auckland’s viaduct, dramatic relic of the Industrial Revolution. \nThe dress rehearsal was impressive. Journalists present at the weekend agreed that this performance had been even more so. \nIt started a few minutes later than the stipulated 9.30pm (darkness is required for many of the effects to work) but the scenes followed seamlessly. \nThe hundreds of human volunteers – as Romans, as Georgian country folk, as jousting knights, as coal miners and much more – performed brilliantly in their colourful costumes and once again even the geese and sheep defied the slur that actors should never perform with animals. \nKynren – An Epic Tale of England was inspired by the long-established Puy du Fou shows in western France. \nMillions have been sunk into preparing the ground for this first Puy du Fou-style show in the UK and its air of permanence demonstrates Mr Ruffer’s remarkable faith in its ability to lift the fortunes of a County Durham town which has suffered economic knocks. \nI drove to the town with my family, taking heed of the advice to arrive as soon after 6.30pm as possible. \nMany others had clearly done likewise but there was no delay in entering our allotted carpark in Bishop Auckland and although the shuttle buses were many and frequent we opted for the 10-minute walk over the viaduct to the site. \nThere pedestrians encountered the first of the many cheerful volunteer stewards who helped to make this a happy and memorable affair. \nWith many exhortations to enjoy the show, they directed us to the newly laid walkway snaking down the hill. \nThere tickets were scanned, bags were checked and people could buy programmes (£10 each) or queue for refreshments (£4.20 for a hamburger). \nThe queues were long but there was time to kill and you could hear people wondering if it really had been necessary to arrive three hours ahead of the show. \nYou could understand it from the organisers’ point of view, with hundreds of performers to attend to as well as thousands of spectators, but the long wait would have been less comfortable if the heavens had opened. \nOn Saturday night there were white and grey clouds in a blue sky but the rain held off. Not many people availed themselves of the free rainproof ponchos on offer and there was a good-natured atmosphere. \nSmart new toilet blocks have been positioned at the entrance and down by the grandstand. \nAfter the show, darkness having fallen, it took us a while to exit the grandstand but the site seemed to empty quickly afterwards with a string of double decker buses shuttling people back into Bishop Auckland where two of the carparks are located . \nBefore the show one of the volunteer stewards, Sue Burke, a support teacher from Weardale, said she had met many new friends through Kynren. \n“It has been hard work and we have put in a lot of weekends but it has been a fantastic experience and we have come together as a team. \n“I think it has given the area a lift and for the young people, in particular, it has given them the feeling that there is something they can do. It’ll give them something to put on their CVs.” \nThe next performance of Kynren is on Saturday, July 9. The last in 2016 is on September 17.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-03T18:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-04T19:39:46.397+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
