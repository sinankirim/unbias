It has already closed its branch in St Albans Road, as well as its cashpoints in Horsefair Street branch and Devonshire Square in Loughborough. \nLloyds has not disclosed which branches are earmarked for closure in the latest cull. \nA spokesman for the banking giant said: \"We don't have the specifics of where they will be.\" \nLloyds, which was bailed out by the taxpayer during the financial crisis, reported pre-tax profits of Â£2.45 billion in the six months to June 30, more than double the sum achieved in the same period last year. \nChief executive Antonio Horta-Osorio said the closures were a result of \"evolving customer behaviours\", with increasing numbers opting for online banking. \nThe bank also blamed post-Brexit uncertainty and the likelihood of interest-rates staying low in the wake of the decision to leave the EU. \nDespite this, Mr Horta-Osorio emphasised that Lloyds was in a \"strong position to withstand the uncertainty\" created by the vote. \nAlmost 10 per cent of Lloyds is still owned by the British taxpayer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-28T12:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-28T13:37:30.302+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
