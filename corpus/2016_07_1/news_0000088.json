From left, Nintex CEO John Burton, Justin Short of Synergi, and Perry Gale and Mike Lovelock of Nintex 08:11 Robert Gibson-NEC AVID Technology partners with Caterpillar on £5.2m vehicle powertrains project \nNorth East-based automotive cleantech firm AVID Technology has secured a key position in a three year collaborative programme to develop more efficient vehicle powertrains with global OEM Caterpillar. \nIn a project co-funded by Innovate UK, the UK’s innovation agency, Caterpillar UK Engines Company Ltd, AVID Technology Ltd, Denso Marston and Imperial College London will collaborate to develop a highly efficient hybrid powertrain for heavy-duty on- and off-highway vehicles. \nAVID’s managing director, Ryan Maughan, said: “To secure a program like this with a major name such as Caterpillar is huge for AVID. \n“This has allowed us to push forwards with significant investments in new facilities and personnel to support the growth of the business and will provide a platform for further growth over the coming years.” From left, Ryan Maughan, AVID managing director; Dr Thanos Alexakis, AVID lead engineer; Chris Lee, Caterpillar project manager; Dr Richard Fairchild, AVID engineering director; Guy Blundell, Caterpillar research manager; and Dr Antonis Dris, Caterpillar senior research engineer at Caterpillars Europe Research and Development Centre in Peterborough 08:06 Robert Gibson-NEC Here's LSL's chairman Simon Embley summing up the situation \n“The Group expects to report a very positive first half performance in a changing market. I am particularly pleased with the profit growth in both Estate Agency and Surveying. \n“Whilst the vote to leave the EU has created uncertainty in the property market, and has impacted consumer confidence, mortgage cost and availability remain positive for the UK housing market. \n“LSL has very strong fundamentals, with a robust balance sheet and a balanced business portfolio including its counter-cyclical Asset Management business. “The business is well positioned to adapt quickly to these changing market conditions and I am confident that it will continue to deliver long term value to shareholders.” 08:02 Robert Gibson-NEC Strong interims for LSL... but full-year figures could be hit by Brexit \nNewcastle’s LSL Property Services plc says expects to report strong interim results on August 2 - but has expressed doubt about full-year figures, given the impact of the Brexit vote. \nThe company, which runs businesses such as Your Move and Reeds Rains, has delivered growth across all major revenue lines. \nProfits are likewise up in both the Estate Agency and Surveying divisions. \nA trading update, however, said EU referendum outcome had led to further consumer uncertainty and that trading performance since had reflected these market conditions. \nIt said: “Whilst it is difficult to accurately predict the market conditions and consumer sentiment for the remainder of calendar 2016, LSL does not expect market conditions to improve sufficiently to meet the Board’s expectations for the full year. \n“Consequently, whilst still expecting growth in profitability in the second half of 2016 as compared to the first half of 2016, LSL now expects that full year Group Operating profit will be significantly lower than previously anticipated.” \nLSL will provide a further update with its interim results on 2 August 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-22T09:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-22T10:29:20.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
