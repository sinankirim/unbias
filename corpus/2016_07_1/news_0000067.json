In the coming months he’s looking to get about and Newcastle is very much on his radar.” Dominic Salter Lord O'Neill of Gatley, Commercial Secretary to HM Treasury \nThe Government says the trip is designed to “reaffirm” its commitment to building a Northern Powerhouse and that Lord O’Neill and Mr Percy, both “proud Northerners”, will build on the strong progress of the last two years. \nMr Percy said: “Building the Northern Powerhouse is a long-term Government priority and central to our plans to rebalance the economy. \n“As a proud Northerner, I am determined to ensure that people in every part of the North – from large cities to small rural communities – enjoy greater control over their lives and stronger, more sustainable economic growth. \n“That’s why this Government will continue to support major investments to unlock the potential of the North and ensure that every area benefits from a growing economy.” Read More Labour plans a 'bank of the North' to provide massive infrastructure boost \nHe said the trip will allow him to hear for himself how devolving greater power from Whitehall to Town Halls would stimulate economic growth. \nMr Percy talked up the progress made already with the five historic devolution deals agreed in the North East, Tees Valley, Sheffield, Greater Manchester and Liverpool. \nBut only this month the North East Combined Authority , made up of the region’s seven councils, put the devolution deal on hold following Britain’s vote to leave the European Union pending further assurances over funding in the aftermath of Brexit. \nHowever this has done nothing to dampen the upbeat message put out by the Government. \nLord O’Neill said: “Making our great northern towns and cities a powerhouse for the economy once again is the reason I joined Government, and the Read More re is evidence everywhere you look that our plans have already made a real impact.
