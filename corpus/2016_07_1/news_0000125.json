Communities minister Marcus Jones said the plan would give the Midlands the potential to grow by £34 billion by 2030. \nRead more: Our voice has to be heard \nMs Soubry called for investment in skills to ensure young people in the Midlands are not left behind and do not feel disaffected in the wake of the Brexit vote. \nShe told delegates at the conference, held at Nottingham Trent University, she believes many of those who voted for Brexit did so \"as a protest\" because they feel \"left behind\" by society. \nMs Soubry said: \"I think it's incredibly important that as a society and a region we recognise we don't have the young people with the skills level they need to have. \n\"Yes, we have got fabulous, excellent universities. \n\"We have some great further education colleges and we have some outstanding schools. \n\"But frankly, we are not doing enough. In this region we have got to do something about a situation that we shall resolve no longer to tolerate.\" \nRead more: Nick Pulley named chairman of £250m Midlands Engine fund \nSir John Peace, chairman of the Midlands Engine, said the region has a major role to play in the UK's economic future. \nHe said: \"At a time of real uncertainty for our nation, there has perhaps never been a more important time for our region to come together and demonstrate why we no longer wish to remain Britain's best kept secret. \n\"The Midlands has much to be proud of and to celebrate. \n\"It has an amazing history and a great heritage. We have a tradition of enterprise and of innovation. \n\"We must harness that spirit and use it to energise our future as a place to do business at the heart of the fifth biggest economy in the world.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-05T11:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-05T11:38:36.775+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
