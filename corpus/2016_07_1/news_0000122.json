the region, creating 100s of jobs. \nThanks for reading - Robert Gibson’s in the blog seat tomorrow. . . \nAny thoughts on today’s tales, tweet me @Scoopford...tra! 9.26 Coreena Ford . . .and Let Britain Fly says attempts to trade outside EU will be hindered without airport expansion \nOn a similar theme, a study this morning claims Britain’s attempts to grow trade outside the EU will be hindered without airport expansion in the South East. Research carried out by accountancy firm KPMG for pressure group Let Britain Fly found that London is currently not directly connected to 128 of the biggest cities in the world - those with populations over two million. \nThe report estimated that by 2030 there will be 77 more cities of that size, and warned that Britain will have limited capacity to connect to any of them without airport expansion. \nThirty-one of these cities will be in the emerging markets of either China or India, according to the study. \nGavin Hayes, director of Let Britain Fly, said: \nBrexit makes airport expansion more important than ever because we urgently need to unlock access to new markets. Yet this cannot happen at scale without a new runway. \nKPMG’s global head of aviation, James Stamp, added: \nNow, more than ever, UK plc needs to demonstrate both its ability and willingness to connect to trading partners and investors in the rest of the world. Making a positive commitment to vital UK aviation infrastructure will send a strong message that we are open for business, and would go a long way to alleviate the concern that we are missing those global connections that are so important for business, jobs, and growth. \nDavid Cameron was expected to confirm whether expansion projects at Heathrow or Gatwick would be supported shortly after the EU referendum, but his resignation following the victory for the Leave campaign means the decision has been left for his successor as Prime Minister, Theresa May. 9.22 Coreena Ford Heathrow expansion call made by North East business and political leaders \nBusiness and political leaders from around the North East are putting presuure on the new Transport Secretary to prioritise a decision on the expansion of Heathrow. \nRepresentatives of the region’s seven councils, along with eight MPs and leaders of the North East England Chamber of Commerce, the regional TUC and the Federation of Small Businesses have signed a letter calling for Chris Grayling to make a decision on a new runway at Heathrow. \nThe heads of top regional businesses, including Newcastle United, law firm Bond Dickinson and Ryder Architcture, plus North East LEP chairman Andrew Hodgson have also signed the letter, which follows a meeting held in Newcastle in April by the Let Britain Fly group where frustrations were expressed at the Government’s delays on making a decision on the matter. \nMost North East leaders favour Heathrow because of the vital links it provides between the region and the wider world. \nBackers of the Heathrow plan say it would create more than 5,000 jobs in the North East and boost the regional economy by £4bn, with the expansion more vital than ever for an exporting region like the North East following last month’s decision for the UK to leave the EU. \nRead the full story here . A British Airways plane taking off from Heathrow airport 9.18 Coreena Ford North East businesswoman promoted to national taskforce \nGreat news for women in business this morning. \nA North East businesswoman has been appointed to a national taskforce established to promote women in enterprise. \nPamela Hargreaves will join 14 other entrepreneurs from across the UK on a taskforce set up by the Federation of Small Businesses to build on the recommendations of its Women in Enterprise report, released earlier this year. \nThe move comes as the organisation prepares to work closely with the newly appointed Minister for Women and Equalities, Justine Greening. \nA long-term passionate advocate for women in business , Ms Hargreaves set up a PR and communications business, Xivvi Ltd, in the North East in 2010. \nRead the full story here . \nThe Journal is currently running a Women in Business campaign, to champion women in the North East workplace and help increase the number of senior female leaders in the region.

Pamela Hargreaves has been appointed to a national taskforce established to promote women in enterprise 9.07 Coreena Ford TSB warns over interest rates despite profits boost \nHigh street lender TSB has warned profits will come under pressure as rock bottom interest rates and soaring IT costs are set to weigh on the group. \nTSB - spun out from Lloyds Banking Group three years ago and then taken over by Spanish rival Banco de Sabadell last March - saw profits more than double in the first half of 2016, but said the performance was unlikely to be repeated in 2017 as it faces a tougher year. \nLenders and challenger banks in particular are set to be hit hard by expected interest rate cuts as the Bank of England moves to shore up the economy after the Brexit vote, as this will impact already under-pressure profit margins. \nTSB is also facing a £125 million hike to costs for IT systems next year, which it must pay former owner Lloyds. \nThe group posted a 144.8% surge in underlying profits on a management basis to £107.7 million for the six months to the end of June. \nOn a bottom line basis, pre-tax profits jumped to £125.4 million, up from £23.2 million a year earlier. \nBut the group said: The expectation of lower for longer interest rates and the contractual increase in IT platform costs in 2017 will have a bearing on the financial performance in future periods.” \nThe group added that it saw a rise in mortgage appointments being cancelled in the immediate days after the Brexit vote, but said this was a “blip” and plans to continue to grow its lending book despite uncertainty caused by the referendum decision. \nTSB saw total lending jump 29% year-on-year to £27.9 billion in the first half, boosted by the addition of 27,000 former Northern Rock mortgages and loans. It has created a new brand called Whistletree to manage Northern Rock mortgage accounts. \nTSB also saw customer deposits rise 13% to £28.1 billion in the half-year, while it said it attracted more than 1,250 new customers on average every day. \nIt added that 7% of customers opening a new bank account or switching banks chose TSB in the first half of 2016. \nPaul Pester, chief executive of TSB, said: \nLooking forward, our mission remains unchanged. In an uncertain world, TSB’s solid foundations - plus the additional firepower provided by Sabadell - will support our responsible growth strategy. 9.04 Coreena Ford 900 jobs created as Sainsbury's launched same-day deliveries \nSainsbury’s is creating 900 jobs and trialling a same-day delivery service to meet the growing demand for online shopping in the UK’s fiercely competitive grocery sector. \nThe supermarket giant said it will start the same-day service at three stores, before rolling it out to 30 stores by Christmas, to keep pace with a rise in online orders across London. \nIt said the service will allow customers who order by 12pm to have their shopping delivered to their home by 6pm, or they can use its click and collect service to pick it up from a supermarket at 4pm. \nThe move is being underpinned by the launch of a new online fulfilment centre in Bromley-by-Bow, east London, where it plans to immediately recruit 470 people followed by a further 430 by 2020. \nThe announcement comes after Amazon revealed its push into the UK grocery market in June when it launched AmazonFresh, which offers same-day fresh food deliveries to 128 London postcodes. \nRobbie Feather, Sainsbury’s director for online, said: \nDemand for our online delivery service in the capital continues to grow. \nWe expect this trend to continue as more and more customers enjoy the flexibility of multi-channel shopping using our groceries website and app, in addition to visiting stores. \nOur online orders are currently picked from supermarket stores across the UK and this model will continue, but the Bromley-by-Bow centre will help us keep pace with demand in London, enabling us to fulfil another 25,000 orders per week. A Sainsbury's store 8.58 Coreena Ford \"One of the most difficult periods we have seen in a long time” - Easyjet CEO \nEasyjet chief executive Carolyn McCall said it was the most challenging trading in her time in charge and “for airlines, one of the most difficult periods we have seen in a long time”. \nShe said the group has also been forced to promote flights in June and July - normally in high demand in peak season trading. \nThere have been 11 strikes in June alone, with a “significant number of cancellations” due to disruption, to add to the wider challenges impacting the sector. \n“More recently, currency volatility as a result of the UK’s referendum decision to leave the EU as well as the recent events in Turkey and Nice continue to impact consumer confidence,” Ms McCall added. \nRevenue per passenger seat on a constant currency basis fell 8.3% in the third quarter, the airline said. \nThe carrier said it had sold about 65% of seats available in its final quarter to the end of September, with per-seat revenue falling 7.5% at a constant currency basis. \nEasyJet declined to give guidance on its full-year profits, but cautioned that “as a result of events in the last week, the revenue per seat trajectory in the fourth quarter remains uncertain”. 8.50 Coreena Ford Easyjet warn of turbulent times amid Brexit vote and terrorist attacks \nEasyJet said it was facing the most difficult summer holiday season for years as it revealed bookings have fallen after the Brexit vote and passenger confidence knocked by political turmoil in Turkey and recent terrorist attacks. \nThe low-cost carrier said bookings were down around 10% since the UK’s decision to leave the EU. \nBoss Carolyn McCall said the group was battling against the toughest period in her tenure at the helm, following two months of turbulence and the EU referendum. \nShe said the pound’s plunge after the Brexit vote had seen a £40 million currency swing against the group, while holidaymaker confidence has also been impacted by sterling’s weakness as well as last week’s massacre in Nice and the attempted coup in popular sun-seeker destination Turkey. \nThe group said revenues dropped 2.6% to £1.2 billion in its third quarter, after being knocked by traffic control strikes, runway closures at Gatwick Airport and severe weather. \nShares dropped 6% after the gloomy update. \nEasyJet has seen its stock tumble after warning last month that it would take a £28 million hit to profits following two months of turbulence and cautioning that Brexit would have a negative impact on the airline. \nThe group is also drawing up plans to potentially move its legal headquarters out of the UK and into Europe if the Government cannot negotiate to retain the status quo in the aviation market, which allows operators to fly across the continent in a deregulated environment. Barry Batchelor/PA Wire 8.46 Coreena Ford HSBC senior executive arrested in US on wire fraud conspiracy charges \nHSBC’s head of global foreign exchange cash trading has been arrested and charged in the US for allegedly conspiring to commit wire fraud on a £2.7 billion transaction. \nThe US Department of Justice said Mark Johnson, 50, allegedly conspired to defraud an HSBC client through a “front running” scheme that netted over £6 million. \nThe Briton, who lives in the US, was detained on Tuesday as he landed at JFK International Airport and released on Wednesday on 1 million dollar (£755,000) bail. \nJohnson was charged along with a second Briton, Stuart Scott, 43, HSBC’s former head of foreign exchange cash trading for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, who lives in the UK. \nThe pair are accused of misusing information in 2011 “provided to them by a client that hired HSBC to execute a foreign exchange transaction related to a planned sale of one of the client’s foreign subsidiaries”. \nAccording to prosecutors the pair, along with other traders they directed, bought sterling for HSBC’s “proprietary” accounts prior to converting about 3.5 billion dollars (£2.7 billion) in sales proceeds on behalf of the client into sterling, knowing the large transaction would boost the price of the pound. \nThe “front running” enabled them to generate 8 million dollars (£6 million), some of it illegally, to the benefit of HSBC and at the expense of their client, it is alleged. \nRobert Capers, US attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said: \nAs alleged, the defendants placed personal and company profits ahead of their duties of trust and confidentiality owed to their client, and in doing so, defrauded their client of millions of dollars. \nThe client was not identified, although the sale was said to relate to part of its ownership interest in an Indian subsidiary. 8.42 Coreena Ford FTSE and Pound latest \nThe FTSE-100 index opened at 6728.99. \nThe pound at 8am was 1.3261 dollars compared to 1.3180 dollars at the previous close. The euro at 8am was 0.8323 pounds compared to 0.8352 pounds at the previous close. 8.38 Coreena Ford Amble hotels to be submitted this autumn \nA design team has been appointed, and is progressing with the potential development of a 30 bed hotel including a food led offer that will bring a high quality 150 cover restaurant and bar. \nArch would look to submit a planning application for this development in autumn 2016, with the aim of appointing a contractor to deliver the scheme in spring 2017. \nCoun Dave Ledger, Arch Chair and Deputy Leader of Northumberland County Council said: \nThrough the provision of an attractive food and beverage offer with modern, affordable accommodation there is a real opportunity to bring more economic activity into Amble and increase visitor numbers. \nSubject to planning permission being secured, this first class leisure facility will be located on a prominent site owned by Arch on the A1068 North East Coastal Route. \nCoun Scott Dickinson is business chair of Northumberland County Council and county councillor for the Druridge Bay ward. \nHe said: \nI look forward to seeing these plans progress. \nA development like this will be great for Amble and surrounding areas like Hadston and Widdrington – helping to attract many more tourists and visitors to the town and creating more jobs for local people. \nOnce established, it can also provide a catalyst for further commercial opportunities in the area and in particular the Coquet Enterprise Park. 8.35 Coreena Ford Top story - hotel plan unveiled for Amble in Northumberland \nExcellent news for the seaside town of Amble in Northumberland this morning. \nArch: The Northumberland Development Company has announced it is in discussions with a regional hotelier to build a hotel and leisure facility. \nThe organisation said: \nAmble is one of Northumberland’s up and coming coastal tourism destinations. Popular for both day visitors and holiday makers it has an attractive harbour and marina and is close to some of the county’s most beautiful beaches. \nTo maximise on these assets there is an identified need for serviced visitor accommodation and three star plus boutique-type hotels to complement the accommodation currently on offer and support the town’s economy. \nNorthumberland development company Arch has been in discussion with an established regional hotelier with the aim of delivering a bespoke, high quality visitor and leisure facility.
