Today, tens of thousands of people still flock to the gala every year. Mirrorpix Durham Miners Gala - Harold Wilson meets members of the Brandon Women's Institute, 1960s \nIn 1925, Bishop of Durham, Hensley Henson, was said to be thrown into the River Wear during the Big Meeting because of his comments that their strikes were immoral as they struggled to avoid starvation on their meagre wages. The tale, however, is probably apocryphal! \nThe gala usually begins in Durham city centre with a parade of colliery banners and performances from local brass bands marching across Elvet Bridge. \nThe parade ends on Durham University Racecourse at Green Lane with guest speakers, a fairground and entertainment. \nThe only time galas haven’t been staged were during the two World Wars, and when major strikes took place in the 1920s and 1980s. Mirrorpix Durham Miners' Gala - Michael Foot, Tony Benn and Neil Kinnock, 1980 \nFollowing the miners’ strike of 1984-1985 and the resulting pit closure programme which decimated National Union of Mineworkers membership, the gala’s future was in doubt. \nThings got so desperate in the mid-1990s it looked like the event might be scrapped. Then New Zealand entrepreneur Michael Watt decided to sponsor it and it was saved. \nAlways a colourful occasion, in 2009, for example, 70 or more miners ’ banners, a host of standards from other trade unions and around 60 bands took part in the parade. \nShunned by both Labour Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, the Durham Miners’ Gala in 2012 welcomed Ed Miliband, the first Labour leader to attend the gala in 23 years. Durham Miners' Gala - Prime Minister Clement Attlee at the gala, 1951 \nLast year saw all four candidates for the Labour Party leadership - including eventual winner Jeremy Corbyn - attending. Mr Corbyn will be a guest at the gala on Saturday. \nLast year’s event attracted an estimated 150,000 visitors and organisers hope even more will attend on Saturday.
