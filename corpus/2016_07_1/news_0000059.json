I’ll be back tomorrow at the crack of dawn, bringing you the best of the North East’s business news as it unfolds. \nIn the meantime, stay tuned to http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/business/ where The Journal’s business team will be working its magic throughout the day. \nHave a good one. R 09:23 Robert Gibson-NEC BHS: a timeline \nBHS was one of the UK’s most recognised high street brands for decades. But after the turn of the century it struggled to compete against value fashion rivals and online shopping.Here’s a timeline of milestones in its history:* 1928: British Home Stores is set up in a store in Brixton, south London. Nothing costs more than a shilling.* 1929: Prices rise to a five shilling maximum as home furnishings are introduced.* 1970: Expansion since the Second World War means the brand now has 94 UK stores and around 12,000 workers.* 2000: Sir Philip Green buys British Home Stores for £200 million. It is rebranded as BHS.* 2002: BHS becomes part of the Arcadia retail empire after Sir Philip pays £840 million for the clothing chain which includes Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and Burton.* 2005: The shop is beginning to lose pace as it is pitched against cheaper rivals such as Primark. \n* 2014: BHS department stores start selling food with the aim for it to be about 10% cheaper on branded goods than the big four supermarkets which are already involved in a price war.* 2014: BHS makes a cash loss of £21 million in the year to August 2014, compared with £19.3 million in the year earlier. \n* 2015: Sir Philip sells BHS to Retail Acquisitions, led by former bankrupt Dominic Chappell, for £1. Work begins on a turnaround plan to try to bring it back into profitability.* 2016: The store is thrown a lifeline in March when creditors back two company voluntary arrangements (CVA) designed to cut costs and prevent widespread store closures.* 2016: BHS collapses into administration in April, sparking an investigation by MPs into Sir Philip and Mr Chappell.* 2016: Administrators fail to find a buyer for the firm and decide in June to wind the company down. Attention now turns to an MPs’ inquiry into its demise.* 2016: Sir Philip appears before MPs in June and admits he sold the business to the “wrong guy” and pledges to “sort” the firm’s pension scheme.* 2016: Sir Philip is branded the “unacceptable face of capitalism” by the inquiry, which finds in July that he systematically extracted huge sums from the collapsed store group while leaving its pension fund in deficit. BHS on Northumberland Street in Newcastle 09:21 Green 'worse than Maxwell' \nFrank Field has argued Green is, in fact, more culpable than Robert Maxwell, who famously plundered the pensions of the Mirror Group. \nHe said: “Maxwell, I’ve always thought, meant to pay the money back. \n“He was just going all over the place, borrowing money to keep his companies going. When the music stopped, he had no money. \n“Now, the music has stopped [at BHS], and there’s someone there who’s managed to catapult themselves towards the top of the Sunday Times Rich List. \n“This person has huge amounts of money, unlike RM. \n“If he wishes now to make good that pension deficit to those 22,000 pensioners, he could do it. But he keeps talking about it, but not doing it.” 09:18 Government: more must be done to avoid repeat of BHS collapse \nA spokesman said: “This case shows why the Government is determined to tackle corporate irresponsibility and reform capitalism so it works for everyone - not just the privileged few. \n“Today’s report is very concerning, and the Insolvency Service is now carrying out an accelerated investigation. \n“Job centres are also standing by to provide support and advice to those who were affected. \n“But in the long run we need to do more to prevent this kind of irresponsible and reckless behaviour.” 09:13 £3bn three-way merger on the cards \nShares in William Hill, Rank Group and 888 rose sharply this morning after the trio confirmed that a £3 billion three-way merger could be on the cards.William Hill shares spiked 11%, Rank rose 2.4% and 888 was up almost 3% after the opening.Online operator 888 and casino giant Rank came clean over their interest in a merger with William Hill over the weekend, with the firms adding on Monday: “The consortium sees significant industrial logic in the combination, through consolidation of their complementary online and land-based operations, delivery of substantial revenue and cost synergies and from the anticipated benefits of economies of scale which will accrue to all shareholders.” 09:07 Study reveals drop in applications to build new shops \nThe number of applications to build new shops has fallen by 9% in the past year, a new study shows.There were 6,700 applications, down for the seventh year in a row, said commercial law firm EMW.The fall shows that high street retailers continue to be hit by the rise in e-commerce, with added pressure from the EU referendum result, said the report.Aimee Barrable of EMW said: “With online retailers continuing to win market share, high street firms have less of an appetite to open new shops, instead opting to develop online services or squeeze extra profits from existing space.“Recent high profile closures will lead to more retail space becoming available on the market. Those retailers still looking to expand their high street presence might look to acquire some of these recently vacated stores instead of applying for any new retail developments.“Also, it may be that many retailers wait before committing to any new shop developments until they have a clearer picture of the economy in the aftermath of the Brexit vote.” 09:01 Robert Gibson-NEC Students introduced to VR \nDozens of students from around the region are being given a first taste of working in the Virtual Reality industry thanks to a unique mentoring programme set up by the owner of a specialist North East games development firm.Experienced games developer and educator Frankie Cavanagh set up the Somniator Studio and Pocket Money Games in November last year to both create innovative new VR games and provide a direct bridge between higher education and the emerging technology sector.Frankie, who also lectures at Northumbria University, chose to base Somniator at the VRTGO Labs in Gateshead’s Baltimore House, alongside a number of other top tier VR and technology firms such as Hammerhead Interactive, Vector 76 and Chronicles VR.Since then, more than 70 students have been taking part in the mentoring programme, using the industry-leading equipment that is available at the VRTGO Labs to work on their own live project briefs during placements can be anything from a few days to several months.All the participants, most of whom come from Newcastle & Northumbria Universities and Gateshead College, undertake their own work during their time on the project, with Somniator paying them for any additional work that they commission them to do on the games that the company is developing. A Virtual Reality industry developer day at the Northern Design Centre, Gateshead 08:58 And in Work and Pensions Committee chairman Frank Field's words... \n“One person, and one person alone, is ultimately responsible for the BHS disaster. \n“His reputation as the king of retail lies in the ruins of BHS. \n“His family took out of BHS ... a fortune beyond the dreams of avarice, and he’s still to make good his boast of ‘fixing’ the pension fund. \n“What kind of man is it who can count his fortune in billions but does not know what decent behaviour is?” 08:50 The parliamentary inquiry's conclusion on Philip Green and the pensions issue... \nThe report said: “Sir Philip gave insufficient priority to the BHS pension scheme over an extended period. \n“His failure to resolve its problems by now has contributed substantially to the demise of BHS. \n“Sir Philip owes it to the BHS pensioners to find a resolution urgently. This will undoubtedly require him to make a large financial contribution. He has a moral duty to act, a duty which he acknowledges.” 08:49 Brexit increased global uncertainty, say G20 ministers \nFinance officials of major economies have pledged to boost sluggish global growth and promised to defend against the shockwaves of Britain’s vote to leave the European Union.In a joint statement after a two-day meeting, envoys of the Group of 20 also rejected trade protectionism, an issue that has risen in prominence as US Republication presidential candidate Donald Trump has talked about restricting access to American markets.The United States, China, Britain, Germany and other governments at the meeting in Chengdu in western China pledged to use spending, monetary policy and regulatory reforms to strengthen growth. They promised to strengthen communication and cooperation but announced no joint action, as some financial traders had hoped.“We are taking action to boost confidence and promote growth,” said the statement. It promised to use “any and all policy instruments” to achieve “strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth objectives”. 08:36 Companies now lest strict about degree credentials \nIn this week’s Monday Interview - http://bit.ly/2anI6pG - Michaela Reaney of Gradvert spoke of how businesses were now looking much less at job candidates’ degree credentials and much more at how ‘rounded’ they were as people. \nHer assertions have now been supported by new research that shows fewer companies are asking graduates to gain a 2:1. \nThe study, from the Association of Graduate Recruiters (AGR), suggests employers are increasingly turning their backs on the traditional minimum requirement, arguing that there is no difference in the workplace performance of those who leave university with an upper second and those who gain a 2:2. 08:30 Green branded 'unacceptable face of capitalism' \nFormer BHS boss Sir Philip Green has been branded the “unacceptable face of capitalism” as a parliamentary inquiry found he systematically extracted huge sums from the collapsed store group while leaving its pension fund in deficit.In an excoriating joint report, two Commons select committees accused the entrepreneur of seeking to blame anyone but himself for the firm’s failure and said he has a “moral duty” to make a “large financial contribution” to the 20,000 pensioners facing substantial cuts to their benefits.While the committees were damning about Dominic Chappell, who bought BHS for £1, and the “directors, advisers and hangers-on” associated with the deal, they said ultimate responsibility lay with Sir Philip. Ian West/PA Wire 08:16 Robert Gibson-NEC Record year for kitchen firm \nA Darlington-based luxury kitchen company is on track for a record year, with sales breaking the £1m barrier for the first time. \nOakstone Designs, which was established in 2004, has also invested in increasing its production capacity, redeveloping the interior of its workshop space and adding new machinery. \nPlans are also in place to appoint a new cabinet maker and an apprentice. \nThe company’s founder, Stephen Kennedy, said: “We use the finest materials and construction methods in our kitchens and the quality of our furniture and designs is first class. I believe this is why we have continued to grow at an exceptional rate. \n“It’s been a very exciting time for us and we’ve been invited to design some magnificent projects this year, which we are really looking forward to seeing come to fruition.” Luxury kitchen specialist Oakstone Designs is line to report a record year 08:05 key event Petards secures £1.2m contract with Bombardier Transportation \nThe Gateshead-based Petards, which develops advanced security and surveillance systems, has been awarded a contract to supply Bombardier Transportation with Petards eyeTrain systems. \nThe new contract, which is worth in excess of £1.2m, is for the supply of eyeTrain saloon and Driver Only Operation (DOO) systems to be fitted to four-car Electrostar Electrical Multiple Unit (EMU) trains to be built by Bombardier. \nPetards’ deliveries are anticipated to commence during the latter part 2016 and to be completed in 2017. \nPetards Chairman Raschid Abdullah said: “We are delighted that Petards’ eyeTrain systems continue to be the system of choice for fitment to Bombardier’s Electrostar trains. \n“This order adds to the hundreds of Electrostar vehicles for which eyeTrain systems have previously been specified and further bolsters the Group’s present order book for delivery in 2017.” \nBased in the Team Valley, Petards works across the rail, defence and emergency service markets. \nIn 2015, it reported revenues of £13.1m, while operating profit increased 22% year-on-year to £935,00. \nAt the time, Mr Abdullah said: “As a result of the past two years positive trading, improved balance sheet and financial robustness following our initial turnaround, we are now well positioned to pursue an earnings enhancing acquisition strategy. \n“We intend to expand the group into a larger and more prosperous business. The board has under review a number of potential businesses to acquire and we will of course be keeping shareholders fully advised of our progress.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-25T09:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-25T11:41:07.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
