Amazon used the earnings announcement to reveal that sales from its second annual Prime Day, where customers on their Prime membership scheme had access to exclusive deals, were up more than 60% on 2015’s event. Inside Amazon's Fulfilment Centre in Hemel Hempstead 8.50 Coreena Ford Hinkley Point delay - reaction \nThe Unite union’s national officer for energy, Kevin Coyne, said the decision by EDF to proceed was historic and urged the Government to sign the contracts as a matter of urgency. \n“Any further delay or backsliding would hold back the economic boost and the accompanying creation of thousands of skilled jobs that this major infrastructure project will bring. \n“Our members are shovel-ready to start work on the country’s first nuclear power station for a generation and British companies are at the ready to build and supply this £18 billion project. “This is the first big litmus test, following last month’s EU referendum. \n“Theresa May’s new Government must now give the final go-ahead and show that it has the appetite for the big infrastructure projects that the UK so desperately needs for its future economic prosperity,” he said. \nRoss Smith, of the North East England Chamber of Commerce has also been tweeting this morning on the subject: 8.45 Coreena Ford Estate agent Foxtons sees profits slump \nProfits at Foxtons tumbled 42% in the first half of the year as the impact of Britain’s decision to quit the European Union hit the London property market. \nThe estate agent said pre-tax profits slumped from £18.1 million to £10.5 million during the period. \nChief executive Nic Budden said: \nUncertainty surrounding the EU referendum led to slow residential property markets in London during the first half of the year. \nQ2 experienced a sharp contraction and we believe that the overall level of property sales transactions made in London during the first half of the year is substantially down on last year. \n“The result of the referendum to leave Europe is likely to lead to a prolonged period of further uncertainty and we do not expect London residential property sales markets to show signs of recovery before the end of the year. \noxtons also said it is reviewing the pace of new branch openings in the short term in response to market conditions.

Wylam Brewery in Newcastle have launched an official Great North Run beer 8.23 Coreena Ford Sir Richard Branson makes call to government over Europe \nVirgin founder Sir Richard Branson said the Government must clarify the UK’s trade relationship with the EU before the nation is hit with higher tariffs and taxes. \nThe call comes as the Virgin Group founder outlined a five-point plan for the UK economy following the Brexit vote. \nIn a column for The New European newspaper, Sir Richard said there was still a “feeling of uncertainty” hanging over the economy, which will continue unless the Government acts fast. \nHe said: \nIt is vitally important that UK business has some idea of how it will be able to trade with its closest trading partners and not slip back to the time before the 1970s when the UK was restricted by high tariffs and taxes.” \nThe fortunes of UK-focused businesses have not improved and the pound remains low, forcing up the cost of imports and travel. \nThe feeling of uncertainty hanging over Britain’s economy has continued into the summer, as the business community waits for clearer signals from the new Government as to how they plan to rebuild long-term relations with our EU trading partners and forge new ones around the world. \nBusinesses across the UK must now adapt to this new reality and look for opportunities out of the disruption caused by the vote. Over the years at Virgin, we have found periods of uncertainty and recession to be good ones to expand through. \nSir Richard’s five-point plan includes action to clarify the UK’s trade relationship with the EU; allowing the three million EU nationals to keep living and working across Britain; focusing on infrastructure projects outlined in David Cameron’s manifesto; increasing global connectivity by pushing ahead with a new runway at Heathrow; and the expanding the Start-Up Loan scheme. \nIn the days after the referendum result, the billionaire businessman said Virgin Group may have lost up to a third of its value following Britain’s vote to leave the EU. He has also called on Parliament to take a second look at the referendum result. \nMedia publisher Archant said The New European newspaper will continue to publish on a rolling basis, following strong first week sales. Sir Richard’s column appears in this week’s edition of The New European newspaper Ben Pruchnie/PA Wire 8.18 Coreena Ford Pre-tax profits tumble 21% at Barclays \nPre-tax profits at Barclays have tumbled 21% to £2.06 billion in the first half of the year. \nThe lender also booked a £400 million charge for payment protection insurance (PPI) in the second quarter, taking its total provisions to £7.8 billion. \nAnd the bank warned that Britain’s decision to quit the European Union could have a detrimental effect on the lender. It said the increased risk of recession with lower growth, higher unemployment and falling UK house prices “would likely negatively impact a number of Barclays’ portfolios”, most notably its mortgage offering. \nTotal income at Barclays was down 9% to £11 billion in the six months to June. \nNet profit for the second quarter came in at £803 million compared with £1.2 billion last year. \nBoss Jes Staley said: “This has been a quarter of very encouraging progress against our strategy. Our core businesses, Barclays UK and Barclays Corporate & International, continue to thrive.” \nBarclays also warned that if Brexit negotiations end with the UK’s financial sector losing “passporting” rights, it would require the bank to make “alternative licensing arrangements in EU jurisdictions” where it operates. \nThe bank said: \nThe result of the referendum means that the long-term nature of the UK’s relationship with the EU is unclear and there is uncertainty as to the nature and timing of any agreement with the EU. \nIn the interim, there is a risk of uncertainty for both the UK and the EU, which could adversely affect the economy of the UK and the other economies in which we operate. \nIndustry concerns following the Brexit vote have centred around the UK’s membership of the single market and whether it will continue to have access to the bank passporting system. \nBanks and financial firms wanting to trade with a country in the European Economic Area (EEA) must apply for a passport, which allows them to sell their products to any country within the EEA. \nHowever, the European Central Bank (ECB) has warned that Britain would not be able to access the passporting system without remaining a member of the single market and abiding by its rules, which includes the free movement of people. A Barclays bank branch 8.12 Coreena Ford Consumer confidence plunges following Brexit vote \nWe have a new consumer confidence barometer, this time in the form of the GfK Consumer Confidence Index, carried out on behalf of the European Commission. \nAnd it shows consumer confidence has suffered its sharpest monthly fall in more than 26 years, revealing deepening post-referendum concern. \nThe Brexit vote caused a “dramatic” 11-point drop to this month’s GfK Consumer Confidence Index. \nThe survey, which dates back to 1974, saw its overall score drop from minus 1 to minus 12 - the sharpest month-by-month fall since March 1990. \nThe figure is a further three-point slide from the minus 9 recorded by the index’s Brexit Special in early July, which found 60% of consumers expected the general economic situation to worsen in the next 12 months. \nEach of the latest survey’s key measures recorded a drop. \nThe biggest decrease - a 19-point fall - was in the outlook for the general economic situation over the next 12 months, taking it to 32 points lower than this time last year. \nThe forecast for personal finances over the next 12 months is down by nine points this month to minus 1, which is seven points lower than this time last year. Joe Staton, head of market dynamics at GfK, said: \nConsumers in post-Brexit Britain are reporting higher levels of concern this month. \nAlthough the rate of decline is slower than reported in the aftermath of the vote to leave the EU, consumers in the UK were also less optimistic about the state of their personal financial situation going forward. \nHowever, the index continues to remain at a relatively elevated level by historic standards. Its future trajectory depends on whether we enter a new period of damaging economic uncertainty or restore confidence by embracing a positive stance on negotiating a new deal for the UK. \nThe YouGov/CEBR (Centre for Economic and Business Research) Consumer Confidence Index reported on Wednesday a “significant and clear dive” to its lowest point in three years following the Brexit vote. \nThe index fell by 4.7 points in the past month, the joint highest one-month decrease since the summer of 2010.

The deal had been expected to be finalised today - but the Government stunned the industry by saying it wanted more time to study the details. \nAround 25,000 jobs will be created by the project, which is already years behind schedule, including thousands in a supply chain which will involve firms right across the UK. \nThere was speculation that Prime Minister Theresa May was involved in the move to allow time to study the details before any deal is signed and sealed. Critics believe the Government has been stung by criticism of the amount of money EDF will be paid for generating power from Hinkley - £92.50 per unit of electricity generated. \nJustin Bowden, the GMB union’s national secretary for energy, said: \nTheresa May’s decision to review the go-ahead on HPC is bewildering and bonkers. \nAfter years of procrastination, what is required is decisive action not dithering and more delay. \nThis unnecessary hesitation is putting finance for the project in doubt and 25,000 new jobs at risk immediately after Brexit. It is a gross error of judgment and must be reversed. \nBuilding Hinkley will not on its own make up for successive governments’ failure to have in place a coherent energy policy, but it is a very important step along that road and, as GMB has been warning now for months, the country’s energy capacity is already so fragile that if we have a cold winter there is a high likelihood we will experience power cuts. \nThe ramifications of this foolish delay are far wider than putting our energy needs in jeopardy - they will immediately call into question other major infrastructure projects coming down the line like HS2 and Heathrow/Gatwick expansion. \nBusiness and Energy Secretary Greg Clark said in a brief statement: \nThe UK needs a reliable and secure energy supply and the Government believes that nuclear energy is an important part of the mix. \nThe Government will now consider carefully all the component parts of this project and make its decision in the early autumn. 8.00 Coreena Ford Good morning - what's on the business menu? \nHello and welcome to Friday. . .and the last live blog of the week from us here on the Journal Business desk. \nA quick check on the stock market reveals no major announcements from our North East listed firms, but Barclays are just announcing half-year results and there are some other national firms updating shareholders. \nThere’s also a lot of post Brexit vote news around this morning too, with Sir Richard Branson calling for clarity on EU trade relations, some latest statistics into consumer confidence that show a sharp drop - the sharpest in more than two decades - and Amazon have released results too. \nWe’ve got lots of regional news too, including news from Wylam Brewery, the latest manufacturing stats for the region and news from the star-studded Safe Summit, where Gwyneth Paltrow and Ashton Kutcher are among the tech-talented stars to take to the stage. \nI’ll provide links through to the news stories I feature too. \nI’m going to here until around 9.30am so please do get in touch if you get the chance. \nIf you’d like to contribute to the live blog, tweet at @jnlbusiness to share your stories, opinions and images, or tweet at me direct @Scoopford. \nAlternatively you can drop me a line at coreena.ford@ncjmedia.co.uk ", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-29T12:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-29T11:18:36.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
