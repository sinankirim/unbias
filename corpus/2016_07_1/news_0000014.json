Food Nation’s managing director, Jamie Sadler 9.15 Coreena Ford Morning market update pt 2: Blue chip builders \nAndy Scott, economist at HiFX, warned there would be further falls for the pound, predicting a drop to 1.25 US dollars and 1.10 euros. \nHe said sterling would suffer as the “economic outlook significantly worsens and the UK awaits political leadership to provide some certainty”. \nBlue chips Barratt Developments and Taylor Wimpey led falls in the housebuilding sector, dropping by another 5% and 3% respectively after heavy declines on Tuesday. \nFellow builder Redrow dropped 5% in the FTSE 250 Index, while estate agents Countryside and Savills were also under pressure, down more than 4% each. Retailers were also suffering falls, with supermarket Tesco more than 5% off and Morrison down around 4%. Barratt Homes development 9.11 Coreena Ford Morning market update - housebuilding shares remain in the red \nConcerns over a Brexit hit to the UK’s property sector saw housebuilding shares remain deep in the red on the London market, although the FTSE 100 Index lifted 24.3 points to 6570.3. \nThe pound’s continued descent has been attributed in part to concerns that Brexit may cause a crash in British commercial property value and hurt the wider economy. \nM&G became the third fund manager to suspend trading in its property fund late on Tuesday, joining Aviva Investors and Standard Life after investors have rushed to pull out of UK commercial property. \nThe property woes added to warnings from the Bank of England that Brexit effects were already taking hold, as well as a slew of recent economic figures pointing to a sharp slowdown in growth. \nA move by the Bank of England to help prop up the British economy on Tuesday, by relaxing rules for banks to boost lending by up to £150 billion, failed to halt the pound’s slide. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: “Combined with a warning that some Brexit effects were already starting to crystallise and this week’s slowdown in recent economic data we’ve seen a bit of a domino effect in locally exposed sterling assets, as well as risky assets generally across the world.” 9.08 Coreena Ford Pound and FTSE latest \nThe pound at 9am was 1.2963 dollars compared to 1.3019 dollars at the previous close. The euro at 9am was 0.8537 pounds compared to 0.8505 pounds at the previous close. \nThe FTSE-100 index at 8:45am was up 15.91 at 6561.28. 9.05 Coreena Ford Baldwins Accountants director John Baldwin on the Evolution buyout \nBaldwins Accountants is one of the largest independent accountancy firms in the UK, with 27 offices - and earlier this year they acquired Rowlands Accountants. \nHere’s what director John Baldwin said: \nRowlands has given us an exceptional start in the North East and now we have the confidence to further invest in the region with Evolution, continuing to build on the excellent brand of both firms. \nWe’re thrilled to be joining forces with Evolution in the North East, this give us greater opportunity to utilise our specialist services across the region. We now have around 200 staff in seven offices across the region from Alnwick in the North to Wynyard in the South. \nBy having such a varied geographical spread, we are developing an invaluable network that will enable businesses in and around surrounding areas to connect with other entrepreneurs further afield in the region. \nWe are looking to invest further in the area in the coming months which underlines our faith in the strong business community and local economy. 9.00 Coreena Ford Evolution accountants acquired by national firm \nA second North East chartered accountancy and business advisory firm has been acquired by the national Baldwins Accountancy Group.

MasterCard is facing a claim of up to £19 billion in damages in a UK collective action 8.35 Coreena Ford Food prices show deepest deflation for more than a year \nGreat news for shopping families but not so great for retailers comes news that household budgets have received a boost with the deepest deflation in food prices for more than a year. \nOverall shop deflation of 2% in June was deeper than the 1.8% decline in May, and lower than the 12-month average of 1.8%, according to the BRC-Nielsen Shop Price Index. \nFood deflation deepened further in June, falling to 0.8% from 0.3% in May, while fresh food reported a further acceleration from 0.8% in May to 1.5% - the deepest rate since September last year. \nShoppers have now been able to fill their baskets and pay less for their goods than the year before for 38 months in an “extraordinary” run of overall shop price deflation. \nBritish Retail Consortium chief executive Helen Dickinson said: \nThis month’s figures show overall shop prices falling once again. \nThis extraordinary 38-month run of deflation has undoubtedly been good for consumers. While it has been driven largely by falling prices for non-food items we have, from time to time, seen food in deflationary territory as well - which provides the real boon for household budgets. \nJune was one of those months with food prices falling by 0.8%, the deepest deflation in food (fresh and ambient) for over a year. \nWhile the good news for household budgets continues, prices in store will eventually rise again. \nHowever, the time it takes for any price increases to make a reappearance will depend on a combination of factors including the future value of the pound, commodity prices and any eventual impact of the Brexit vote on input costs.
