We look forward to welcoming staff and students and building on the relationships that already exist.” \nThe earliest any changes to programmes will take effect will be for the start of the 2017/18 academic year, though detailed timings are yet to be agreed. \nBoth universities “will carefully manage the transition and will provide appropriate support to minimise any disruption”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-13T15:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-13T16:51:35.934+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
