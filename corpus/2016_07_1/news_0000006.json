Retired policeman Doug Thomas was one of the first to discover the scene. \nHe said: “The graffiti said Death to Islam with some swastikas. \n“The police and council were there. My wife had gone past it at half six, she rang me up to tell me about it. \n“Everybody was stopping because it was so prominent.” \nHe added that council workers used a spray to quickly remove the black marks. \n“It was pretty shocking, I was pleased that the council came out so quickly to get rid of it and it was gone by half past nine.” \nAnother Allerburn Lea neighbour who didn’t want to be named, said: “It was unbelievable to see it this morning. If the message was against immigrants and Muslims, Alnwick has hardly got either. \n“It’s a lovely little house, and a quiet place to begin with. I think the vandals must have come from another area.” \nResidents said a council caretaker and his wife used to live in the cottage but the small home had been left empty for two years. \nPolice were at the scene with one officer knocking on doors around the estate as part of the investigation. Councillor Gordon Castle \nAlnwick councillor Gordon Castle condemned the “truly depressing” act, saying that it’s the first time he’d seen such a crime in the area. \nHe said: “It most definitely does not reflect Alnwick, It’s something the likes of which I have never seen here before. \n“If there are these sorts of views in Alnwick, they’ve been extremely well hidden. \n“I hope it’s just a mindless youth yob, who didn’t know what they’re doing, but if it’s someone who knew the full extent of their horrible intentions, they deserve to be dealt with.” \nCoun Castle added: “It would be easy to link this to Brexit, but I would like to think that this wasn’t a result of the referendum. \n“We’ve seen across the country an increase in hate crime, I hope this is not part of that, but you must not rule it out.” \nRetired couple Norman and Hilary Whitelam who have lived on the street for 15 years had seen the workmen cleaning the cottage and were shocked to hear about the graffiti.

You don’t think of something like that happening here.” \nNorthumberland County Council confirmed they own the deserted cottage, which was part of the council’s former base Allerburn House, but are planning to sell it on in the near future. \nAlnwick resident Claire Barber who also owns a business in the town said “I have lived and worked in Alnwick for almost 17 years with my daughters and it is a very peaceful town with an exceptionally low crime rate, so to see the graffiti this morning was a real shock. \n“The former Northumberland County Council lodge is well known and is located right at the entrance to Allerburn Lea housing estate, where families and executives primarily live. \n“Thankfully the police and the council were quick off the mark to clean it off. Vile anti-islam graffiti on a cottage in Allerburn Lea in Alnwick \nInspector Sue Fryer, of Northern Area Command, said: “We received reports of racist graffiti on Denwick Lane in Alnwick at around 7.30am on Tuesday. \n“We contacted the local authority who acted quickly to clean the area in question to remove the graffiti. \n“Our officers will be carrying out extra patrols in the area to make inquiries into the incident and to reassure any concerned members of the public. \n“This is an isolated incident but we will not tolerate this type of behaviour in our region and will be doing all we can to identify those responsible. \n“Any witnesses, or anyone with any information that could help police, should contact officers on 101 quoting reference 175 12/07/16.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-12T20:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-12T21:56:10.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
