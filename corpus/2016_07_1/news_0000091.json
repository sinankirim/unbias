another planned student accommodation scheme and completed work at a prospective park. We’ve also got a tech firm helping war veterans by using 3D printing - more on that later - and the launch of a comic tea brand... \nI’ll be back at 8am tomorrow - get involved by tweeting at me @Scoopford 9.22 Coreena Ford FTSE and sterling update \nThe pound at 9am was 1.3157 dollars compared to 1.3298 dollars at the previous close.

Nickie Gott, She’s Gott It managing director and chair of the North East England Chamber of Commerce Women’s Advisory Board 9.03 Coreena Ford \nFrom today’s front page of The Journal comes news of the devolution deal . \nProposals which could release billions of pounds in funding for the North East have been put on hold until the UK has a new leader. \nLeaders of the region’s seven councils chose to freeze discussions over devolution for the North East on Monday pending further assurances over funding in the aftermath of the EU referendum result. Will Metcalfe/Twitter George Osborne signs the North East devolution agreement 8.57 Coreena Ford Regeneration specialist in \"period of uncertainty\" post-Brexit \nRegeneration specialist St Modwen Properties has reported a slump in profits and warned that it is operating in a “period of uncertainty” as a result of Brexit. \nThe Midlands-headquartered business has said pre-tax profits for the first half of the year came in at £30 million compared with £206 million last year. \nThe firm also booked a one-off £13 million hit from the increase in stamp duty. \nRevenue rose to £159.7 million from £135.7 million. \nChief executive Bill Oliver said: “Following the referendum held on June 23, we are now operating in a period of uncertainty in relation to many factors that impact the property market. \n“Whilst it is too early to accurately predict how the UK property market will respond, until we have more clarity we believe it is appropriate to take a more cautious approach to the delivery of our development strategy.” \nMr Oliver’s comments come after Standard Life Investments suspended trading in its £2.7 billion UK Real Estate fund yesterday as investors spooked by the Brexit vote scrambled to ditch commercial property holdings. 8.50 Coreena Ford Pudding Parlour expands into Newcastle's Grainger Market \nGrainger Market in Newcastle is fast becoming something of a foodie destination, with American-style pud experts Pudding Parlour opening up a new store. \nMy biz desk colleague Robert Gibson went along to speak to the owners, brother and sister Greg Small and Kristy Giblin, on their first day of trading at the market about the rebirth of the historic market, (and brought back some pretty amazing Rainbow Cake). Brother and sister Greg Small and Kristy Giblin outside The Pudding Parlour's new store in the Grainger Market, Newcastle 8.45 Coreena Ford Gaming giant tombola unveils new £5m HQ plans for Sunderland \nMore good news from gaming giant tombola, which has announced plans to build a new £5m headquarters in the North East with the potential to create a significant number of new jobs. \nThe firm – Europe’s biggest online bingo company – is currently working with Newcastle architecture practice Ryder on proposals to build a new company HQ next to its current base at Wylam Wharf. \nThe firm already employs 310 people and there’s scope to create many more. How Tombola's new HQ, designed by Ryder Architecture, will look 8.39 Coreena Ford Shares and pound fall ahead of Bank of England Financial Stability Report \nThe FTSE 100 Index and the pound began the day in the red, slipping ahead of another announcement from Bank of England governor Mark Carney. \nLondon’s top tier was down 0.45%, or 29 points, in morning trading at 6,493. Sterling slid 0.73% to 1.31 dollars, close to the 31-year low it fell to following the Brexit vote. \nMr Carney, who last week signalled that the central bank will slash interest rates over the summer, is expected to lay bare the Bank’s assessment of the UK economy in its latest Financial Stability Report at 10.30am. \nExperts expect the governor to relax capital requirement rules for banks in order to provide them with more flexibility in the wake of Brexit. \nMr Carney could also increase the Bank’s funding for lending scheme, which provides cheap loans to banks to encourage them to lend. \nThe FTSE 250, a better barometer of UK sentiment, was down 219 points. \nTony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: “London’s FTSE 100 has stuttered at the open with early gains proving unsustainable although direction was always going to be difficult to establish ahead of the Bank of England’s Financial Stability Report that’s due at 10.30am today. \n“There’s a theme of defensiveness amongst the stocks that are sitting at the top of the board, whilst it’s fund managers who are languishing in early trade following some pessimistic broker notes on the sector. Property stocks are also suffering across the board.” \nOn Monday, Standard Life Investments suspended trading in its £2.7 billion UK Real Estate fund on Monday as investors spooked by the Brexit vote scramble to ditch commercial property holdings. 8.37 Coreena Ford The Herb Garden set to open second restaurant \nNow for a look at some of our stories that you may have missed, starting with great news from The Herb Garden in Newcastle, who are opening a second restaurant at the Royal Quays Marina in North Shields. The building’s still under construction but if CGIs are anything to go by it’s going to be a real winner! Anyone who’s been to the Westgate Road restaurant will know of Herby the Horse, the rollerskating stallion, who guards the door. Will Herby get a brother or sister at the new one? \nRead the rest of the story here . A CGI of the new restaurant building at Royal Quays Marina from which The Herb Garden will operate 8.30 Coreena Ford KPMG and BT report into cyber crime reveals \"arms race\" \nBusinesses are in an “arms race” with criminals over the threat of cyber attacks, according to a new report by BT and audit firm KPMG. \nOnly a fifth of IT bosses within major corporations are confident they are fully prepared for a cyber attack, the report claims, despite findings that showed 97% of those asked had experienced an attack of some kind. \nBT Security CEO Mark Hughes said: “The industry is now in an arms race with professional criminal gangs and state entities with sophisticated tradecraft. \nThe 21st-century cyber criminal is a ruthless and efficient entrepreneur, supported by a highly developed and rapidly evolving black market.” \n“With cyber-crime continuing to escalate, a new approach to digital risk is needed - and that means putting yourself in the shoes of attackers. Businesses need to not only defend against cyber-attacks, but also disrupt the criminal organisations that launch those attacks. \n“They should certainly work closer with law enforcement as well as partners in the cyber security marketplace.” 8.25 Coreena Ford Persimmon on Brexit \nPersimmon moved to soothe fears over a Brexit hit within its robust trading update, assuring there would still be “good opportunities” in Britain’s property market. \nThe builder said that, while it was “too soon to judge” the impact of last month’s vote to leave the European Union, it believes the “market fundamentals remain strong”. \nIts comments come after shares in UK-listed housebuilders took a hammering following the Brexit vote amid fears it would spark a downturn in the housing market, with 38% wiped off Persimmon’s stock market value in a savage two-day rout. \nBut shares across the sector have since rallied higher as markets have recovered. \nPersimmon’s assurances follow figures on Monday that fuelled fresh fears for housebuilders after revealing the construction sector experienced its worst month for seven years during the run-up to the EU referendum. \nThe closely watched Markit/CIPS construction purchasing managers’ index signalled a shock contraction in the sector, driven by a “steep decline” in housebuilding and the first fall in commercial construction work since May 2013. 8.17 Coreena Ford The Gym Group beefing up membership \nBudget fitness firm The Gym Group - which has three gyms in Newcastle - continues to flex its muscles and cash in on the growing trend among Britons to get fitter. \nThe company reported a 19.4% surge in members over the first half and now has 424,000 people on its books. \nChief executive John Treharne said: “This is another strong performance underlining the strength of our business model, the power of our low-cost proposition and the success of our rollout.” \nMr Treharne added that the Gym Group is on track to meet full-year expectations, with analysts pencilling in pre-tax profits of up to £9 million. \nLast year, the firm recorded an adjusted pre-tax profit of £5.3 million on sales of £60 million. \nThe group, which listed on the stock market in November, opened six new gyms in the period. Inside one of The Gym Group's fitness centres 8.15 Coreena Ford BHS' former owner defends actions \nFor anyone who missed Newsnight, the former BHS owner was on the programme defending taking millions out of the doomed retailer as a “drip in the ocean” and accused Sir Philip Green of siphoning huge sums from the firm. \nFormer bankrupt Dominic Chappell admitted he was a “chancer” who had benefited “a lot” from owning the high street giant, but denied the £2.6 million package that included a £600,000 salary had contributed to its demise. \nBHS’s collapse in April left 11,000 people out of work and a £571 million black hole in its pensions fund, triggering an inquiry by MPs into the whereabouts of the cash. \nSpeaking to BBC’s Newsnight Mr Chappell said he “sincerely and utterly” apologised to the high street giant’s staff and insisted he had made every effort to turn the ailing company around. \nHe said: “I took a big risk going in and it was a risk reward, we live in a risk reward society, that’s the way companies are built and fail. Did I take a lot of money out? Yes I did. But did the business fail because of the amount of money I took out? No it didn’t. \n“This was just a drip in the ocean compared to the money that was needed to turn around BHS. \n“What would I say to them [BHS employees]? I sincerely and utterly apologise for you being out of work. \n“It’s hideous. It did not need to happen. \n“We did take money out of BHS but we certainly didn’t take nearly £1 billion out of it.” \nMr Chappell previously told the Commons Business and Pensions Committees that his efforts to save BHS were confounded by Sir Philip, who owned the retailer for 15 years PA Wire Dominic Chappell, the man who bought BHS for £1 from Sir Philip Green, appears before MPs to answer questions over the retailer's collapse at Portcullis House, London 8.10 Coreena Ford FTSE 100 and Sterling latest \nThe pound at 8am was 1.3186 dollars compared to 1.3298 dollars at the previous close. The euro at 8am was 0.8433 pounds compared to 0.8372 pounds at the previous close. \nThe FTSE-100 index at 7:44am was unchanged at 6522.26 8.05 Coreena Ford Housebuilders Persimmon and M J Gleeson booming \nFrom listed firms with North East presence we have very strong trading updates from housebuilders Persimmon and MJ Gleeson. \nM J Gleeson, an affordable homes and strategic land specialist – which has regional offices at Wynyard Park in Teesside and Chester-le-Street - has put out an update following the end of its financial year on June 30 2016. \nGleeson Homes sold 904 homes during the year, an increase of 20.4% compared with the previous year’s total of 751 and it also remained very active in purchasing sites, \nThe land pipeline of owned and conditionally purchased plots at 30 June 2016 increased by 23.9% compared to the prior year, totaling 9,284 plots of which 4,927 plots have been purchased subject to planning permission.

With the average selling price of circa £205,500 having increased by 6% (2015: £194,378), Group revenues of £1.49bn were 12% ahead of last year (2015: £1.33bn).
