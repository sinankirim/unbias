Business Editor Tom Pegden talks to the local polish business community to see how it might be affected \nOver the past decade, thousands of Polish workers have made Leicestershire their home. Since Poland joined the EU in May 2004, economic migrants have taken advantage of employment opportunities – starting businesses, opening shops, and generally oiling the wheels of British industry. \nThe last census suggested the number of Polish nationals in the city was 6,417, with a further 3,521 in Leicestershire. \nA 2013 study by Oxford University's Migration Observatory suggested that the Leicester figure had gone up 1,111 per cent since 2001 when it had been 530 – representing the biggest proportional change in foreign-born residents in the city. \nRead more: San Carlo founder still works seven day weeks despite being 72 \nSo how will Leicestershire's Polish workers and entrepreneurs be affected by Brexit? \nKey issues range from the rights of workers and their families, to access to Polish labour and, fundamentally, whether economic migrants still feel welcome in the UK as and when the divorce with Europe goes through. \nEmil Butrym and Mircin Ciesielski run M&E Accident Repair Centre, in Connock Street, Thurmaston, just opposite the city's Porsche garage. \nEmil, 34, has been in Britain for a decade and said his biggest concern now was how the overall economy would be hit – and the knock-on impact on his business. \nThe pair started from scratch four years ago in a corner of an existing body shop. \nOver time they brought in three staff and continued to grow. Today they have a workforce of 20. \nEmil, from Gorzów, in West Poland, said: \"Marcin was doing panel work, and is now quality control, while I concentrated on business development and administration. \n\"Insurance companies did not want to talk to us because we were too small and too young, so we were working for small independent car sellers. \n\"We concentrated on the business and put all our time and emotion into it, and slowly started getting bigger, getting bigger customers. \n\"Now we are doing work for main dealers and insurance companies. We are approved by Nationwide, Hastings and One Call Insurance, for instance. \n\"We moved to Thurmaston in April, 2014, and had maybe 10 people at the time. Now there are around 20. \n\"Every year is different, but from scratch we have doubled turnover every year. Last year it was £350,000 and this year will be maybe £600,000.\" \nEmil came to the UK in 2006 when restrictions were lifted, moving to Leicester because of the opportunities here. \nHe said: \"Launching a business is always difficult. \n\"My background is business and marketing and this is something I always wanted to do. If I had been in Poland I would have done it there. \n\"Our staff are mostly Polish but not just Polish. There are UK staff as well. \n\"I believe that Brexit won't affect me personally. But I'm scared about the economy in general. I'm trying to worry less than I was at the time of the referendum because emotions have come down, and I hope it will stay that way. \n\"I still don't know if we will or won't leave. \n\"If we do leave I believe it will be bad for the UK and the EU. \n\"Everything will need to be built back up again and it will slow the movement of products and people from the EU, and if that happens it slows down the economy. \n\"I guess it will affect Polish workers depending on how long they have been over here. \n\"For people with their own homes, who are settled here, I believe they will be all right. \n\"My company works on overdraft, so it wouldn't be easy just to move it back to Poland. I also have responsibilities and duties here. \n\"But I'm so busy I don't have time to worry. My customers have not changed since the vote. \n\"I feel quite secure here because I have worked here so long, so my big fear is of a recession, which is the last thing a young company needs. \n\"The question is how big will it be? Even if we leave Europe the borders will stay open to make things as easy as possible. \n\"If they stop people coming and it slows down here, it will have a big impact on business. \n\"Poland sees the UK as a strategic partner in business and politics. \n\"It all depends on what the Government does and how the EU reacts.\" \nTadeulz Buzala runs 14 Polish delicatessens around the country called Delikatesy Smaczek, and opened his latest branch in Belgrave Gate, Leicester, in May. \nThe new shop has 17 staff – all but one of whom are Polish, and he plans to bring in more as the business grows. \nTadeulz said: \"We opened in Leicester because I wanted to be in a big city with a big Polish population and other nationalities. \n\"It's not easy to find people to work and I think it's hard to see what happens next. \n\"For Polish people who have been in the UK for a long time I do not think anything will happen. \n\"But if they do make some people go home who is going to work here? \n\"Things have changed and Polish people don't need to come to the UK to find work. They can find work in the rest of Europe – they might earn less, but everything is cheaper. \n\"Immigration helps the UK economy. We all pay taxes and make lots of money for the Government. \n\"My worry is that in one or two years' time it will be very difficult to find people to work. \n\"We have a couple of people who came to England to work with us in Leicester, and even found them houses because it is already so difficult to find staff.\" \nFrontline Recruitment has an office in Bowling Green Street, Leicester, offering general blue collar positions in areas such as industrial, warehousing and welding. \nGeneral manager David Essam said one of the biggest challenges he faced was finding people to fill jobs. \nHe said: \"We have got a lot of Eastern Europeans working for us, filling roles, and working hard and doing the hours. \n\"Probably half our workforce is European, and temporary contracts can range from maybe a day to two, three, four or five months. \n\"I don't know if the referendum result is good or bad. We will just have to wait and see what happens, and we're finding out more information every day.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-26T14:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-26T15:43:33.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
