Throughout your time at the Home Office a number of us had an effective working relationship with you and while we sometimes held differing views, our dialogue was always constructive and business-like. \n“We noted and understood your reasons for meeting with Scotland’s First Minister in your first week as Prime Minister. \n“Your efforts to meet leaders outside London is commendable. However, the North of England has long had concerns that we are being ignored, caught between an economically and politically powerful London and an increasingly politically important Scotland. \n“As we negotiate our exit from the European Union, you have made clear that you believe in having an approach and negotiation objectives that include the whole of the United Kingdom. On that point we wholeheartedly agree. It is absolutely vital that the voice of the North of England is heard loud and clear during the Brexit negotiations. The North of England has a population greater than London and almost three times that of Scotland. Our economy is significantly larger than Wales’ or Scotland’s. \n“Accordingly, we would like to invite you to meet with us at your earliest convenience to discuss our role within the Brexit negotiations and how we can work together for the benefit of the North. Tony Lloyd would be happy to host this meeting in Greater Manchester in the very near future. \nYours sincerely, \n“Tony Lloyd, Greater Manchester Combined Authority \n“Mayor Joe Anderson, Liverpool City Region Combined Authority \n“Councillor Paul Watson, North East Combined Authority \n“Councillor Sir Steve Houghton CBE, Sheffield City Region Combined Authority \n“Councillor Peter Box, West Yorkshire Combined Authority.” More on the EU Referendum", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-18T09:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-18T10:14:06.733+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
