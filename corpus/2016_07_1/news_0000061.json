By Robert Gibson-NEC The Journal Business team's live blog bringing you the morning's most important business and financial news Shares Get business news by email Virgin Money chief executive Jayne-Anne Gadhia \nGood morning and welcome to the Journal Business team's morning Live blog for Tuesday, July 26. \nI'm Robert Gibson and I'll be bringing you regular updates on all the breaking business news from across the North East. \nWe will have stories, pictures, tweets and comments covering the latest big stories from the region's business community, as well as national news, FTSE updates and stock exchange announcements from the Journal region's listed companies. \nIn this morning's news we have half-year results from Virgin Money Holdings, showing pre-tax profits have risen by a whopping 53%. Quantum Pharma has likewise released the latest product in its Mucodis range. \nI'm here all week, from 8am to 9.30am and I'll take you through the events to keep you informed as they break, and give you a flavour of what to expect from us news-wise over the course of the day. \nIf you'd like to contribute to the live blog, tweet at @jnlbusiness to share your stories, opinions and images. \nAlternatively you can drop me a line at robert.gibson@ncjmedia.co.uk or tweet me at @JournalGibson Key Events So Far 09:28 Robert Gibson-NEC Waffles \nThat’s it, folks. Stayed tuned to http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/business as we’ll be keeping you posted with some cracking tales throughout the day. \nI’ll also be speaking to a guy about waffles - but I’ve said too much already... Catch you tomorrow morning. R Waffle 09:26 Robert Gibson-NEC Brexit vote knocks employment confidence despite unemployment fall \nConsumers are feeling less confident about their jobs in the wake of Britain’s vote to ditch the European Union, a report has found.The Deloitte Consumer Tracker said uncertainty surrounding the Brexit vote took its toll on employment confidence, which fell three points following the referendum result and six points compared to last year.It said the overall headline measure for consumer confidence stayed at minus 8 for the second quarter of 2016 - its lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2014. 09:14 Robert Gibson-NEC What did Betjeman know anyway? \nSlough is becoming one of the UK’s top creative hubs along with Heathrow, Basingstoke, Warrington and Wigan according to research. \nManchester, Brighton and Bristol are more historically known as “creative cities”, but a number of “creative conurbations” are on the rise.These clusters of creative businesses and employment - which include jobs in advertising, film, radio, television, architecture and publishing - can be found along motorway corridors and close to major transport centres.Other areas with a high concentration and growth in the creative industries include Chichester and Bognor Regis, according to research from Creative England and innovation charity Nesta. Juan Mateos-Garcia, head of innovation mapping at Nesta, said: “The UK’s geography of creativity is diverse and growing. London and other creative cities are very important, but so are other areas which are sometimes overlooked when we talk about creative clusters.” 09:08 Robert Gibson-NEC More details on those Accenture jobs... \nSome of the new roles created for the HMRC work will likely be dedicated to maintenance of the platform. \nOthers may centre on the transition to the cloud and it is possible that further mobile services will also need to be developed. \nMr Larsen, who leads the firm’s work with HMRC, said: “I think we have developed a strong and trusted relationship with HMRC during the time they have worked with us; as the Newcastle Delivery Centre has been able to successfully deliver what has been required, that track record has put us in good stead for the future. \n“This is a positive story for the Delivery Centre and in terms of the work undertaken in the North East with one of our most important Government clients.” 09:00 Robert Gibson-NEC 30 North East jobs created as HMRC renews Accenture contract \nAccenture is to create at least 30 new jobs at its Newcastle Delivery Centre after HMRC renewed a major contract with the company. \nThe firm, which has worked with the government department for around two decades, will develop, implement and maintain a secure cloud-hosted tax-management platform for the National Insurance and PAYE Service. \nMark Larsen, managing director of Accenture’s Newcastle Delivery Centre, said: “In support of HMRC’s innovative and customer-focused program, we will deploy leading digital technologies to radically transform and re-engineer the National Insurance PAYE Service applications and architecture, placing them at the heart of taxation for individuals.” \n(We’ll be bringing you more on this story soon...) Mark Larsen, MD of Accenture in North Tyneside, at its delivery centre in Newcastle 08:52 Robert Gibson-NEC Warning on negative interest rates \nA major high street banking group has warned that more than one million of its customers could be charged negative interest rates if market conditions change.In a letter setting out changes in terms and conditions to 1.3 million customers across NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) business and commercial banking, the banking group warned it might charge customers in the event of negative interest rates.The letter warned: “Global interest rates remain at very low levels and in some markets are currently negative. \n“Dependent on future market conditions, this could result in us charging interest on credit balances.” 08:49 Robert Gibson-NEC BT Openreach should become 'distinct company' - Ofcom \nBT’s Openreach network should become a “distinct company” within the BT Group as part of reform proposals put forward by telecoms regulator Ofcom which fall short of recommending a sell-off.The telecoms giant has faced calls for Openreach to be split off from the rest of the company.But in a report released on Tuesday, Ofcom instead proposes major reform of the division of BT that develops and maintains the UK’s main telecoms network used by telephone and broadband providers such as Sky, TalkTalk, Vodafone and BT Consumer.The proposals include making Openreach a distinct company with its own board, including a majority of non-executive directors not affiliated to BT Group.It also proposes greater consultation with customers on large-scale investments, its own staff working for Openreach, ownership of assets that it already controls, its own strategy and control over budget allocation, and independent branding.Sharon White, Ofcom chief executive, said: “We’re pressing ahead with the biggest shake-up of telecoms in a decade, to make sure the market is delivering the best possible services for people and business across the UK.” Nick Ansell/PA Wire 08:44 Robert Gibson-NEC North Sea strike \nNorth Sea workers have started the first 24-hour strike in almost 30 years after the failure to resolve a row over plans to cut pay and allowances.Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union and Unite, employed by the Wood Group on Shell platforms, walked out at 6.30am on Tuesday, with further stoppages planned in the coming weeks.Around 400 workers are involved in the strike, as well as a ban on overtime, following overwhelming support for action from members of both unions.Officials say workers’ pay and allowances could be cut by as much as 30% following the downturn in the industry.RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: “After savage redundancies and attacks on workload and working conditions, this group of offshore workers are now told that they are going to be railroaded into accepting pay cuts of up to 30%.Dave Stewart, chief executive of Wood Group’s eastern region business unit, said: “Our employees’ safety and well-being remains our top priority and our commitment is to ensuring it is not compromised during industrial action. Although we are extremely disappointed that industrial action will be taken, we respect the right of those employees who choose to do so.” 08:40 Robert Gibson-NEC Profits drop at oil giant BP \nProfits at oil giant BP have plunged 44% to 720 million US dollars (£549 million) in the second quarter.The slump in underlying replacement cost profit, the benchmark industry measure, comes as the sector battles with low oil prices.BP boss Bob Dudley said: “Compared with a year earlier, the underlying second-quarter result was impacted by lower oil and gas prices and significantly lower refining margins, but this was partly offset by the benefit of lower cash costs throughout the group as well as lower exploration write-offs.“We are delivering significant improvements to the business that will stick at any oil price. We are now well down the path of transforming our business to compete, whatever the future holds. We now see a much stronger outlook for BP and are focused on growth, both for this decade and beyond.” 08:36 Robert Gibson-NEC And you can watch from the comfort/drudgery of your office! Yeah! 08:29 Robert Gibson-NEC The seriously groovy Sage Summit \nIn case you haven’t seen it, here’s our first story about the Sage Summit in Chicago - http://bit.ly/2ab6kB2 \nGwyneth Paltrow, The Killers, Ashton Kutcher... How hip is that? \nToday, the great Richard Branson will be taking the stage. Oh, and we might learn a thing or two about tech while we’re at it. 08:22 Robert Gibson-NEC Quantum launches latest Mucodis product \nThe Burnopfield-based Quantum Pharma plc has launched the latest product in its Mucodis range, aimed at addressing the side effects associated with cancer treatments. \nMucodis Rectal Gel helps prevent and treat rectal mucositis, a common side effect of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. \nThe product is being launched by Colonis, part of the Quantum’s Niche Pharmaceuticals division. \nChief executive Andrew Scaife said: “We are excited by the potential that the Mucodis range offers the NHS and patients as there is a clear unmet need for this type of relief and we are confident that our products will have a significant effect on improving patients’ quality of life.” Quantum Pharma - Aseptic suite 08:13 Robert Gibson-NEC 'Strong position' to deal with post-referendum uncertainty \nFollowing the EU Referendum outcome, market commentators have suggested the mortgage market could slow and that unemployment could rise. \nIt is also possible that Bank Base Rate could be reduced and stay low for a long time. \nVirgin Money has therefore made some limited adjustments to its financial outlook. \nBut Ms Gadhia said: “Since the vote to leave the EU we have experienced continued strong customer demand and no evidence of changes in customer behaviour. \n“Virgin Money is in a strong position to deal with a period of post-referendum uncertainty as a low risk retail bank with a high-quality asset base and unburdened by legacy conduct issues.” 08:07 'We look to the future with confidence', says chief executive \nVirgin Money chief executive Jayne-Anne Gadhia said she was “delighted” to report on the company’s “excellent” first half. \nShe said: “We continued to grow the business strongly and have delivered a 53 per cent increase in underlying profit as a result of our increased share of the mortgage market and the continued success of our credit card business. \n“I am particularly pleased that more customers than ever before would recommend Virgin Money to their friends and family with our overall Net Promoter Score increasing to +28 in the first half of the year. \n“After taking into consideration our strong performance in the first half of the year and the prospects for the company, we are pleased to announce that the board has declared an interim dividend of 1.6 pence per share in respect of the half-year.” \nShe added that Virgin Money remained on track to achieve its target of £3bn of high quality credit card balances by the end of 2017. \nIt also remained focused on maintaining the high quality of its mortgage bsuiness. \n“We look to the future with confidence and will continue to drive our customer-focused strategy of growth, quality and returns.” Virgin Money chief executive Jayne-Anne Gadhia 08:03 Virgin Money reports huge half-year growth \nVirgin Money has reported strong growth for the half-year to June 30. \nDuring the period, underlying profit before tax increased by 53%, rising year-on-year from £66.4m to £101.8m. \nGrowth continued across all the core businesses, and the company said it had maintained its focus on a “high quality balance sheet, underpinned by strong capital ratios and prudent risk appetite”.
