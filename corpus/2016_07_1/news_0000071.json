Sedgefield MP Phil Wilson added that an empowered UKIP would lead to the “break-up of the UK”. \nA former head of maths at Handsworth Christian School, an independent school in Sheffield, Mr Arnott decided to throw his hat in the ring after deputy leader and fellow northerner Paul Nuttall chose not to run. \nIt comes on yet another extraordinary day in British politics. Calls for a snap General Election have been made by Labour and Liberal Democrats as Theresa May looks certain to replace David Cameron as Prime Minister following Andrea Leadsom’s withdrawal from the Conservative Party leadership race. Angela Eagle has also formally challenged Jeremy Corbyn after the Labour leader lost a vote of confidence among MPs.

They don’t want a champagne-swilling Islington elite Labour Party that looks down on the working class with some kind of morbid fascination and curiosity. \n“What do those 13.6m people want? I think they want to see a credible plan for what happens after Brexit. \n“They want to know about the jobs that we’ll create. They want us to deal with the thugs like those in my constituency who videoed themselves torturing a defenceless animal to death and didn’t go to jail. \n“They want a party that is pro-worker, rewards hard work, and also supports our small businesses, because we’re not living in Victorian times any more, having to choose between workers and the evil bosses. Being pro-small businesses helps to create jobs, and that’s good for working people too.” Read More How Nigel Farage's party of 'fruitcakes' and 'racists' flourished in the North East \nMr Arnott, a 35-year-old chess master, ousted Tory Martin Callanan to become North East MEP in 2014, having served as UKIP’s general secretary for six years, masterminding the party’s rule book and its approach to local elections. \nHe could face competition for the top job from Suzanne Evans, should her suspension from the party be lifted, as well as fellow MEPs Diane James and Steven Woolfe. \nMillionaire businessman Arron Banks, who was the main donor to the unofficial Brexit campaign Leave.EU, and Mr Farage’s former adviser Raheem Kassam are also thought to be interested in the position. \nHe has previously spoken of the need for the UK to accept more Syrian refugees and says his campaign won’t be an attempt to “out-Nigel Nigel”. \n“We must never, ever, ever, be a Party which is anti-immigrant or anti-immigration but we can be fiercely anti-uncontrolled mass net immigration,” he said. \nHe added: “Any candidate for the UKIP leadership would be mad to try to out-Nigel Nigel. I say that we should do things differently, drawing on the vast talents, skills and expertise that we have within the Party. \n“Nobody could emulate Nigel’s 18-hour a day, seven-day a week approach and it would be foolish to try: the rest of us would be burnt out within a month. That’s why I want a team-based approach, bringing democracy into our internal structures and giving the unsung heroes of UKIP the opportunity to shine.” Jack Taylor/Getty Images UKIP Leader Nigel Farage \nPhil Wilson said: “Instead of Nigel Farage taking on the responsibility of us leaving the EU , he has stepped down and is running scared. All of the promises the Leave camp made, such as giving the NHS an extra £350m-a-week, were part of the biggest con trick ever pulled on working people. UKIP has said it was a mistake to say the funding would be there for the NHS. \n“The question for the likes of Jonathan Arnott or whoever the next UKIP leader will be is how regions like the North East will be properly funded. \n“The region was a net recipient of EU funding. Where’s that money for jobs and investment going to come from? UKIP has no credible plan for the North East and the UK. In fact, their plans could lead to the break-up of the UK.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-12T02:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-12T05:33:02.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
