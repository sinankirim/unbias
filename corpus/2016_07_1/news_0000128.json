In doing so, she marked a radical departure from the policies of the UK’s last female prime minister, Margaret Thatcher. \nThe unions have welcomed her comments. Beth Farhat - Regional Secretary TUC \nBeth Farhat, regional secretary of the Northern TUC, said: “Theresa May has said she will change corporate governance to crack down on excess executive pay, put workers on company boards and tighten up rules to block predatory takeovers. \n“And she has said we need a more active industrial policy to protect British industry. \n“These are things that the TUC has long campaigned for, so if the implementation is done well it could be good for the North East. \n“It could help ensure companies in our regional industries are focussed on long term, sustainable growth and have fairer wage policies.” \nShe added: “But the North East’s prospects also depend a great deal on her handling of Brexit. The TUC has published a plan of action for the steps the government needs to take to prevent the Brexit vote becoming an economic calamity. \n“She should immediately be making plans to step up public investment across the UK. We need public investment in the North East to improve our infrastructure, keep the economy growing, and ensure private investors see a strong future here.” Jonathan Walker (right) at the North East England Tourism Awards \nMeanwhile Jonathan Walker, head of policy and campaigns, North East England Chamber of Commerce , said: “We now urge her to provide reassurance for businesses concerned about the impact of the EU Referendum result and show commitment to support our region’s exporters. \n“We will continue to campaign for a fair funding deal for the region and the need for decisions on major capital projects like Heathrow’s expansion which have been on the backburner for far too long.” North East Chair of the Institute of Directors and Senior Partner at Recognition PR Graham Robb \nHis views were echoed by Graham Robb, chairman of the Institute of Directors in the North, who said: “I have met Mrs May a number times. She stood for election in the North East in the 1990s and understands the issues we deal with every day and how the region’s uniquely strong work ethic and entrepreneurial spirit will overcome them.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-13T19:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-13T20:45:09.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
