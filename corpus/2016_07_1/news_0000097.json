Here's what you can expect 08:30, 12 Jul 2016 By Jonathan Walker Theresa May has already set out many of her plans for when she becomes Prime Minister this week Shares Get daily news by email Christopher Furlong/Getty Images Theresa May \nWhat does Theresa May believe? \nShe gave some detail about what we can expect now that she is Prime Minister in a speech delivered in Birmingham on Monday. \nWe look at Theresa May’s thoughts and beliefs ahead of her taking over the top seat. Leaving the European Union - and no second referendum \n“I couldn’t be clearer. Brexit means Brexit. And we’re going to make a success of it. There will be no attempts to remain inside the EU, no attempts to rejoin it by the back door, and no second referendum.” \nCutting energy bills \n“I want to see an energy policy that emphasises the reliability of supply and lower costs for users.” Borrowing to spend on infrastructure \n“More Treasury-backed project bonds for new infrastructure projects.” \nThe end of the Northern Powerhouse (or perhaps, to extend the Northern Powerhouse idea to other parts of the country) \n“A plan to help not one or even two of our great regional cities but every single one of them.” Read More \n“A proper industrial strategy to get the whole economy firing.” Making it harder for foreign investors to launch hostile takeovers of British firms \n“As we saw when Cadbury’s – that great Birmingham company – was bought by Kraft, or when AstraZeneca was almost sold to Pfizer, transient shareholders – who are mostly companies investing other people’s money – are not the only people with an interest when firms are sold or close. Workers have a stake, local communities have a stake, and often the whole country has a stake.” \nShe added: “A proper industrial strategy wouldn’t automatically stop the sale of British firms to foreign ones, but it should be capable of stepping in to defend a sector that is as important as pharmaceuticals is to Britain.” Giving consumers and employees a say in the running of big business \n“If I’m Prime Minister, we’re going to change that system – and we’re going to have not just consumers represented on company boards, but employees as well.” Encouraging public sector staff to manage public service providers \n“We should encourage public sector workers to set up mutuals.” School reforms (but no details yet) \n“School reform is ... a passion for so many Conservatives – and I will be setting out my own plans for schools policy in the coming weeks.” A major housebuilding programme \n“We need to do far more to get more houses built.” Read More May faces election calls following PM 'coronation' as Leadsom quits Tory race Stamping down on fat-cat pay \n“Executive pay has more than trebled and there is an irrational, unhealthy and growing gap between what these companies pay their workers and what they pay their bosses. \n“So as part of the changes I want to make to corporate governance, I want to make shareholder votes on corporate pay not just advisory but binding. I want to see more transparency.” Stamping down on banks and utility firms that take advantage of lack of competition \n“I also want us to be prepared to use – and reform – competition law so that markets work better for people. If there is evidence that the big utility firms and the retail banks are abusing their roles in highly-consolidated markets, we shouldn’t just complain about it, we shouldn’t say it’s too difficult, we should do something about it.” Making firms like Google, Starbucks and Amazon pay a fair share of tax \n“It doesn’t matter to me whether you’re Amazon, Google or Starbucks, you have a duty to put something back, you have a debt to your fellow citizens, you have a responsibility to pay your taxes. So as Prime Minister, I will crack down on individual and corporate tax avoidance and evasion.” A Government “at the service of ordinary, working people”. \nShe said: “If you’re from an ordinary, working-class family, life is just much harder than many people in politics realise. You have a job, but you don’t always have job security. You have your own home, but you worry about mortgage rates going up. You can just about manage, but you worry about the cost of living and the quality of the local school, because there’s no other choice for you.” \n“These are the reasons why, under my leadership, the Conservative Party will put itself – completely, absolutely, unequivocally – at the service of ordinary, working people. It is why we will make Britain a country that works for everyone.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-12T10:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-12T12:02:37.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
