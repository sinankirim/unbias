Gareth Fuller/PA Wire A woman wearing a t-shirt in tribute to Senior Aircraftsman Christopher Dunsmore, who died in Iraq, carries the Iraq Inquiry Report as she leaves the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre, London, after the publication of the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq War \nNow it could be argued that Chilcot might not only have destroyed any shred of reputation Blair had left, he might help save the position of Corbyn. \nFor, post Chilcot, Labour MPs might find themselves re-thinking what kind of a leader they want. \nOne like Blair with the despotic arrogance to not even consult his Cabinet while disregarding the view of millions who took part in peace rallies around the globe when making the most important post World War II decision on foreign policy matters. \nCompared to it, voting for Brexit was like deciding what curtains to hang in number 10. \nOr one like Corbyn who, although far from perfect, might actually be interested in other people’s views on a matter of such great importance and view war as a last, not a first, resort. \nSome - actually, probably all - Labour MPs might guffaw and remind us that their present leader was well known for going his own way and voting against the party line. Like he did when he voted against the Iraq war - the deceitful devil. \nIt was also interesting how his potential rivals - Angela Eagle and Tom Watson - and the man who set the ball rolling, Hilary Benn, voted FOR it. Ian Austin, Labour MP for Dudley North, and former press secretary to Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown \nThe post Chilcot debate was debased by Labour MP Ian Austin telling Corbyn to ‘sit down and shut up’ and calling him a ‘disgrace’ as his leader dissected Blair’s Iraq war role. I wonder if the families of those who lost loved ones in the conflict agreed with Austin, or even if he cared what he thought, so keen is he to ‘Get Corbyn’. \nStill, Austin is easily ignored. What won’t be so easily ignored is the Chilcot report. Before its publication, because it took seven years, there were fears of a whitewash. It proved well worth the wait.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-09T12:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-09T14:04:37.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
