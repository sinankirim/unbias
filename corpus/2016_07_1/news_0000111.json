Here are 10* things 16:38, 13 Jul 2016 After six years and 68 days as Prime Minister, we try to find things Mr Cameron did for the region - *We may or may not be able to find 10 Shares Get daily news by email Prime Minister David Cameron leaves number 10 Downing Street to attend his final Prime Minister's questions \nDavid Cameron was Prime Minister for six years and 68 days, first as head of a Coalition Government, then for the Conservative party. \nThat’s plenty of time to have an impact on the North East, is it not? Mr Cameron is to be replaced by former Home Secretary Theresa May , who enters Downing Street with more than half of voters thinking she has what it takes to be a good Prime Minister. \nThe public support for the new PM came as satisfaction ratings for her outgoing predecessor David Cameron and opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn fell to their lowest since they took office. \nSome 55% of voters - and 81% of Conservative supporters - questioned by Ipsos Mori for the Evening Standard said Mrs May had what it takes to be PM, compared to just 18% for former rival Andrea Leadsom, who handed her the keys to Number 10 by pulling out of the leadership race on Monday. \nBut as one era ends another begins - so what did Mr Cameron ever do for the North East? \nWe tried to find 10 things. Mayor of London Boris Johnson signs the I'm supporting the Dualling of the A1 Campaign 1. The A1 being dualled (in part) \nIn terms of duration, the Chilcot report was like a hastily scribbled note compared to the length of time the dualling of A1 has been discussed, reports written and feasibility studies done. Finally, it is happening! Work on dualling this key road as far North as Ellingham is a £290m investment in the region that Labour failed to make during its 13 years in power, so that’s a good start. 2. Devolution \nHis Chancellor George Osborne’s austerity policies has seen North East councils fiscally challenged, to put it mildly, but hey, the region was in line for a devolution deal which could be worth £1.5bn to the region. \nIt included a non-ringfenced £30m-a-year into a newly-established North East Investment Fund, while a mayor, to be elected in 2017, can collect an additional £30m-a-year in business rates specifically for infrastructure. It ties the Government to considering reinstatement of the Blyth and Ashington rail line, a Rural Growth Network plan, a pan-North East transport strategy, a North East Land Board to trigger more house-building. Although, there is some doubt about this now because of...

Brexit \nAn unintended boost from Cameron was his calling the EU referendum which gave the North East the chance to give the Establishment a bloody nose, whilst (it could be argued) at the same time shooting themselves in the foot. Mixed metaphors aside, a massive 58% of the region voted Leave, so it must have felt good come the morning of June 24. Quite what they think about it now, might be a different matter. James Wharton, MP for Stockton South 4. The Northern Powerhouse \nWhile some cynics, naming no names, think it should be called ‘The North West and bits of Yorkshire Powerhouse’, the region at least gets the chance to ride on the coat tails of the others now and then. Like when the region’s leaders were invited on an important trade delegation to the Far East, which was nice. Will it survive if George Osborne loses the Chancellor’s job? Time will tell. 5. A commitment to enterprise zones \nThe new enterprise zone will be spread across 12 sites, while a £100m fund will be set aside for North East start-up firms. The zone, covering a total of 115 hectares on sites stretching from Northumberland to County Durham , could create as many as 14,000 skilled roles in four specialist areas: health and life sciences; creative and digital; subsea; and low carbon industries. Roads minister Robert Goodwill above the A1 Western Bypass with Lynne Biddles of the Highways Agency 6. Work on Western bypass at Gateshead \nThe recently completed £61m scheme to improve the A1 from Coal House to the Metrocentre will tackle congestion and benefit the 116,000 drivers who use the A1 each day. Drivers are now able to use an extra lane in each direction as well as two new local link roads. \nMore than 300 jobs have been created by the scheme, with 97% of the construction workers required coming from the North East. The Milky Way seen over Sycamore Gap in the Northumberland International Dark Sky 7. He loved Northumberland (allegedly) \nSo much so, he penned a love letter to it which began: “From Hadrian’s Wall to Europe’s biggest sky park, this county is one of the many jewels in Great Britain’s crown.” \nSadly the letter was an off-the-shelf template filed to several regional newspapers up and down the land, so it seemed he loved Lincolnshire, Warwickshire, Cornwall and Isles of Scilly, Yorkshire & the Humber and Norfolk too, but it’s the thought that counts. And anyway, I’m struggling to get to 10 so it’s in. Prime Minister David Cameron visits the new Hitachi Rail Europe facility in Newton Aycliffe, County Durham 8. Hitachi Rail Europe \nThe new £82m Newton Aycliffe train-building factory will create 700 jobs and countless more in the supply chain. Much credit should go to campaigners in the region, not least Sedgefield’s Labour MP Phil Wilson, but George Osborne and David Cameron played a part in the deal. It is part of a £5.7bn contract from the Government to Hitachi to supply its InterCity Express Programme (IEP) trains. 9. Food banks \nThe policies of his Government helped create Britain’s busiest food bank, here in the North East, specifically Newcastle’s West End. Hurray. Oh. 10.
