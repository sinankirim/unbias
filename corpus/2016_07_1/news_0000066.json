G4S has started to directly procure properties to accommodate asylum seekers in the city and will be managing these. \nNewcastle also continues to support 20 households under the Government’s Afghanistan resettlement scheme. \nThe scheme resettles ex-Ministry of Defence interpreters from Afghanistan to the UK, most of whom would have been at risk had they remained in the Middle East. Ten Afghani interpreters have been settled in the city this month. \nCouncillor Joyce McCarty, deputy leader of Newcastle City Council , is expected to tell councillors on Thursday that the city will continue to welcome refugees for the next four years. Joyce McCarty, deputy council leader at Newcastle City Council \nShe will say: “This year has seen the worst refugee crisis since World War Two and Europe has seemed overwhelmed by the number of people, displaced by war and conflict, seeking safety. \n“I am proud that Newcastle, as a City of Sanctuary, has been able to respond to this crisis proactively.” \nSince the Syrian civil war began, as many as 386,000 people have been killed, including nearly 14,000 children, says the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

Dominic Lipinski /PA Wire Amber Rudd \nAmber Rudd, the new Home Secretary, announced plans to commission Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary to carry out a “scoping study” into forces’ understanding of and response to hate crime. \nMs Rudd said: “Those who practise hatred send out a message that it’s OK to abuse and attack others because of their nationality, ethnicity or religious background; that it’s OK to disregard our shared values and promote the intolerance that causes enormous harm to communities and individuals. \n“Well, I have a very clear message for them - we will not stand for it. Hatred has no place whatsoever in a 21st century Great Britain that works for everyone.” More on the EU Referendum", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-27T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-27T13:46:38.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
