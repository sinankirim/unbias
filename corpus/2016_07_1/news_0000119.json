X \nCopy link to paste in your message / Comments (0) \nLoughborough MP Nicky Morgan says she is very disappointed Michael Gove has been eliminated from the race to be the next Tory party leader and prime minister. \nMrs Morgan had been backing the man she succeeded as education secretary in the leadership contest but he failed to get the support of enough Conservative MPs to make it onto a ballot of the last two candidates. \nSome 150,000 rank-and-file Tory members will decide whether Home secretary Theresa May or Brexit campaigner Andrea Leadsom is installed in Number 10 in September. \nAfter the second MPs' ballot Mrs May finished with 199 votes, Energy Minister Mrs Leadsom had 84 and Mr Gove, the justice secretary, 46. \nMrs Morgan expressed her disappointment that Mr Gove had not made the cut but announced she was now giving her full support to Mrs May who she said was ' now the one clear choice' to be Prime Minister. \nSouth Leicestershire MP Alberto Costa had also been in Mr Gove's camp while Rutland and Melton MP Sir Alan Duncan and Charnwood's Ed Argar were behind Mrs May. \nMrs May said: \"I am delighted to have won so much support from my colleagues. \n\"This vote shows that the Conservative Party can come together - and under my leadership it will. \n\"I have said all along that this election needs to be a proper contest. And now it is time for me - and my team - to put my case to the Conservative Party membership.\" \nMrs Leadsom's campaign chief Tim Loughton said the run-off represented a \"quirky\" choice for the Tories. \n\"They both went to state schools, they are both women, hey, that's pretty quirky for the Tory party. Isn't this the new sort of Tory party?\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-07T19:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-07T19:57:34.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
