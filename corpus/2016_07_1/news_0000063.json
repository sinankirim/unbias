One way we wanted to build on those plans was with greater control over European development funds. \n“Brexit potentially puts that ambition at risk, and we find ourselves in the unacceptable situation where the threat to jobs is increased because we have a government which seems reluctant to give even short term assurances of funds up to 2020, let alone longer term. \n“We need guarantees and we need the government to stop dithering and start to set out how the economy will look as a result of the referendum. It is vital that ministers match our ambition, and I made this clear to Greg Clark when we spoke this week.” \nOne candidate for the role of North East mayor argued however that the biggest threat to jobs and investment in the region was Labour’s inactivity over devolution. \nIndependent candidate Jeremy Middleton said: “Local Labour politicians are threatening to press the self-destruct button on the region’s economy because they are scared to fight an election. This decision, which could mean the region loses jobs and investment, has been taken because they saw their power-base in the North East threatened in the EU referendum. \n“This is not a time for playing political games. It is more important than ever to make the case that the North East is open for business. However they have sent out the opposite message. While the leaders of Manchester, Liverpool, London, Sheffield and Teesside are championing investment, our politicians are effectively turning it away. \nHe added: “What our leaders don’t realise is that following the Brexit vote, the Northern Powerhouse and devolution agenda is more important than ever. The devo-deal would mean real power to change our region for the better, with new budgets to create more jobs and get better skills for our kids, and to improve our transport and NHS.” \nAny agreement over devolution has been postponed until a new prime minister and chancellor are in place.
