And HOW good does it look?! It’s not called The View for nothing. \nWell done Wilson family -get ready for big queues, (you had me at Prosecco on tap).

Brilliant news all round. Sally Ann Norman The Rocket at Stephenson Quarter Development in Newcastle, which will soon house hundreds of Convergys workers 8.45 Coreena Ford North East LEP calls on Government to ensure EU funding \nOur top story this morning is on how the body charged with developing the North East economy is seeking assurances from the Government over the delivery of EU funding to the region. \nThe North East Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) has committed £89.5m of EU structural funding to boost growth in the region, while a further £104.5m was submitted to the Government for approval in the run up to last month’s referendum. \nThe projects already approved will support more than 7,400 businesses across the North East LEP area, and also provide support and training to around 30,000 people either looking for work or trying to progress through improving their skills. \nRead the full story by business editor Graeme Whitfield here . Andrew Hodgson of SMD Ltd in Wallsend 8.37 Coreena Ford Regional breakdown on the consumer confidence report \nThere’s a semi-regional breakdown for the consumer confidence report - and there are distinct differences in how confidence has changed regionally, with the North being the least confident. \nConfidence dropped 19 points in the north of England and 11 points in Scotland. \nIn the south, including London, there has been a two point drop. \nConfidence among 16 to 29-year-olds has dropped 13 points, but this group remains the most optimistic of all age groups. \nThe biggest dip in confidence from a household income perspective is among those earning between £25,000 and £49,999, who registered a 16 point drop. Meanwhile, figures released by BDO’s monthly High Street Sales Tracker (HSST) show the Brexit vote had an immediate impact on the high street, which suffered its worst June in more than 10 years. \nA strong start to June saw overall sales grow 3.8% year-on-year in the first week, but the ‘Brexit effect’ hit retailers with increasing severity as the month wore on. \nSales saw a 3.1% drop in the second week and by the final week of June - two days after the Brexit vote - overall year-on-year sales had plummeted 8.1%. 8.32 Coreena Ford Consumer confidence drops to lowest level in two decades \nIt’s been an emerging theme for the last couple of week, and now a report has shown consumer confidence has seen its sharpest drop in more than 20 years since the Brexit vote. \nA third of shoppers believe prices will increase rapidly in the next year and some 60% of consumers expect the general economic situation to worsen in the next 12 months. \nThat’s up from 46% in June, while just 20% expect it to improve, down from 27% last month, a one-off GfK Consumer Confidence Barometer survey taken after the referendum found. \nThe proportion of people who believe prices will increase rapidly in the next 12 months has jumped 20 percentage points from 13% to 33%. \nThe core index has fallen eight points to minus 9, and all key measures used to calculate it have fallen. \nThe long-running survey, which dates back to 1974, has not seen a sharper drop since December 1994. \nGfK head of market dynamics Joe Staton said: \nDuring this period of uncertainty we’ve seen a very significant drop in confidence, as is clear from the fact that every one of our key measures has fallen, with the biggest decrease occurring in the outlook for the general economic situation in the next 12 months. 8.25 Coreena Ford John Lewis warns of Sterling plunge impact \nYet another high street retailer has warned of issues ahead presented by the falling pound. \nThe boss of John Lewis has warned that the plunge in sterling could become a problem for the department store chain. \nAndy Street said that although the firm is “fully hedged” against currency fluctuations for 2016/17, next year it could be an issue. \nHe said: “The big issue is the decline in exchange rates. \nWe hedged this year but the issue is next year, it will have an effect. If inflation gets into value chain, it will feed through.” \nSince the referendum result, sterling has collapsed against both the dollar and the euro. \nEarlier this week, John Lewis saw sales growth slow in the seven days following Britain’s decision to leave the European Union. \nBut Mr Street denied it was anything to do with Brexit, saying it was more likely linked to an earlier start to its summer clearance sale and the weather. “The market has been challenging even before Brexit. Since the result, there’s been no implication for sales,” Mr Street said. \nHowever, Mr Street did say that his major concern is the potential reduction in the growth of consumer spending as the economy looks set to fall into recession. \n“For us to start being concerned, the obvious thing for us is a reduction in the growth in consumer spending. \nBut has it actually changed behaviour? It’s just far too soon to say.” Managing director (MD) Andy Street of John Lewis 8.20 Coreena Ford Indeed....Brexit bounce expected for all publishers \nNewspaper groups across the board have seen a spike in sales following the political and economic turmoil unleashed as a result of the Brexit vote. \nIan Whittaker, analyst at Liberum, said: \nThe past months have been tough for the UK newspapers as they have suffered from the UK ad spend volatility ahead of the Brexit vote. \nYet, the Brexit vote should be positive for newspapers: in the short term, it should help boost circulation revenues given the coverage given to the Brexit vote and its consequences; and in the medium to long term, the Brexit vote - where most newspapers supported a Leave vote - will be taken as a demonstration of how much influence newspapers still have, which is a persuasive argument to use with advertisers. 8.17 Coreena Ford i newspaper sales boom following Brexit \nPublisher Johnston Press has been given a Brexit bounce, with sales of its i newspaper soaring following Britain’s decision to quit the European Union. \nSales data from last week shows daily circulation consistently over 300,000, peaking at 319,000. \nJohnston Press acquired the i in April, when its average audited circulation was 270,182. \nThe firm also said that advertising revenue for the same week was the highest since the acquisition. \nThe company said: \nThese figures show a further increase from the week of the referendum, indicating a continued desire for impartial and informative journalism, highlighting the vital role that newspapers play around major milestones for the country. \nNotwithstanding the referendum, which has evidently been beneficial for newspaper groups in general, i’s circulation and readership. \nThe online version of the newspaper, launched in April, also saw a record amount of traffic, breaking through the one million page views per week barrier for the first time. 8.12 Coreena Ford FTSE 100 and Sterling latest \nThe FTSE-100 index opened at 6533.79. \nAnd a marginally improving pound at 8am was 1.2930 dollars compared to 1.2925 dollars at the previous close. The euro at 8am was 0.8568 pounds compared to 0.8561 pounds at the previous close. 8.10 Coreena Ford Tata Steel - speciality steel sale set for confirmation \nIt’s later today that the sale of the speciality steel business is expected to be announced, after a meeting of Tata’s board in Mumba. \nBusiness Secretary Sajid Javid will meet senior Tata board members in Mumbai today during a visit to India to discuss future trade links following the UK vote to leave the EU. \nHe said: \nFollowing the referendum result, my absolute priority is making sure the UK has the tools it needs to continue to compete on the global stage. \nThat is why I am in India today to launch these initial trade discussions. \nThere is a strong bilateral trade relationship between our two countries and I am determined that we build on this. \nOver the coming months, I will be conducting similar meetings with other key trade partners, outlining the government’s vision for what the UK’s future trade relationship might look like. Business Secretary Sajid Javid 8.05 Coreena Ford Tata Steel latest as unions press for clarity \nIndian steel giant Tata is being urged not to allow its biggest UK plant to “wither on the vine” as speculation mounts that the company is to announce the sale of part of its assets. \nThe firm looks set to confirm that it will sell its speciality steel business, which employs 2,000 workers in Hartlepool, Rotherham and Stocksbridge. \nThe move would increase uncertainty among workers in the rest of Tata’s operations, including the country’s biggest steel plant at Port Talbot in South Wales. \nTata has been assessing several bids for weeks after announcing earlier this year that it was selling its loss-making UK business. \nSpeculation has been growing that it will sell off its speciality steel business but will continue to assess options for the rest of its plants. \nUnite warned Tata against “walking away” from Port Talbot in a few years’ time after leaving it to “wither on the vine”. \nNational officer Harish Patel said: \nThe cloud of uncertainty over steelworkers’ heads needs to be lifted by Tata giving binding commitments about its long-term intentions regarding Port Talbot and its UK strips business. \nIf Tata is to retain the goodwill of the workforce then its board needs to give guarantees over Port Talbot and assurances that it won’t conduct a fire sale of its speciality and tubes business. \nPort Talbot and the UK strips business can have a viable and profitable long-term future with the right investment. \nThey have a world-class workforce making world-beating products. \nUnite will be pressing Tata for clarity over its intentions and ensuring it sticks to its promise to be a responsible seller and act ethically.
