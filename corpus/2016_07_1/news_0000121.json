Analysis of people seeking online help from Citizens Advice in the first 24 hours after the vote showed immigration was the top search term, with citizenship third. Brexit was the seventh most popular search. \nRead more: MPs will debate second EU referendum after 4 million sign petition \nCitizens Advice LeicesterShire has also received queries about how Brexit will affect immigration, citizenship and employment. \nTh charity is encouraging people to seek advice if they are unsure about their rights or feel they have experienced discrimination. \nRichard Evans, chief executive at Citizens Advice LeicesterShire said: \"People have lots of questions about what leaving the EU means for their day-to-day lives. \n\"For some people, it is as significant as what country they can call home. For others, it is about their rights at work or personal finances. \n\"It is important to remember nothing changes yet and that for the time being all rights remain the same. \n\"It is likely to be several years before any changes to the law come into effect. \n\"We are here to help anyone who has a query about their rights and encourage people to come to us if they think they have been treated unfairly or discriminated against.\" \nAnyone requiring advice or support can get help online or on 0300 330 1025.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-13T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-14T00:54:56.606+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
