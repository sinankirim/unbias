Newcastle MP condemns idea of deporting EU migrants living in North East 15:30, 9 Jul 2016 By Jonathan Walker Newcastle MP slams Tories for failing to make it clear EU migrants can stay in post-Brexit Britain Shares Get daily news by email Chi Onwurah \nThe Government must now make it clear that immigrants from EU countries won’t be thrown out, MPs have demanded. \nContinued uncertainty about the future of EU nationals living in the UK makes it harder for employers to recruit staff and damages the economy, said Newcastle MP Chi Onwurah . \nAnd she described the idea of deporting EU migrants as “evil.” \nThe MP was speaking after the House of Commons overwhelmingly backed a motion demanding that the Government make it clear that EU immigrants can stay in the UK despite the referendum vote to leave the European Union. \nLabour proposed the motion and the Government opposed it - but Conservative MPs were told to abstain on the vote, which meant that it was approved by the Commons. \nHowever, Tories who ignored instructions to abstain included Boris Johnson, the Conservative who helped lead the campaign to take the UK out of the EU, and voted with Labour MPs. \nWhile nobody has called for EU migrants to be deported, Theresa May, the Home Secretary who is a candidate in the contest to choose a new Conservative leader and Prime Minister, has suggested that she cannot guarantee the right of EU citizens to live in Britain because it will be part of EU negotiations. \nMrs Onwurah, MP for Newcastle upon Tyne Central , said: “Its outrageous. \n“I was very glad that our motion was passed by such an overwhelming majority, but the hypocrisy and lack of moral compass on the Conservative side is astounding.” \nSpeaking during the Commons debate, Home Office Minister James Brokenshire told MPs the UK wanted to ensure that British nationals living in European countries were also given the right to remain where they were. \nMrs Onwurah said: “Their position seems to be that of course they wouldn’t do anything that evil but they want to retain the capacity to do something evil in case other countries do it. \n“The fact that Boris Johnson walked through our lobbies will not have reassured people one little bit.” \nThe MP, who is a shadow business minister representing Labour on issues involving digital industries, said she met a French software developer living in \nthe UK earlier this week who was considering leaving the country. \n“It’s unsettling and it’s economically damaging because people will be looking to leave, and firms will have more difficulty recruiting, \n“We can’t have this situation going on for months.” PA Wire Theresa May \nDefending the Government’s position during the Commons debate, Mr Brokenshire told MPs: “In the approach the Government takes and the agreements we make, we will never treat EU citizens as pawns in some kind of cynical game of negotiation chess.” \nThe Tory frontbencher said a “fair deal” for EU nationals in the UK and Britons living in member states was the aim of the Government. \nHe said: “We want to be able to guarantee the legal status of EU nationals who are living in the UK and I am confident that we will be able to do just that. \n“We must also win the same rights for British nationals living in European countries, and it will be an early objective for the Government to achieve those things together.” \nTory former minister Crispin Blunt said EU citizens in the UK would need to be reassured “long before” Brexit. \nDuring the debate, Labour Shadow Home Secretary Andy Burnham suggested Home Secretary Mrs May was trying to “woo” the Tory Party grassroots as she fights to become the next prime minister and of using EU citizens as “bargaining chips”. \nHe attacked Mrs May for failing to attend the debate and accused her of an “abdication of leadership”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-09T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-09T17:47:42.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
