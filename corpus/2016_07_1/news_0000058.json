Shares Get daily news by email Andrew Percy, MP for Brigg and Goole, was appointed as the new Northern Powerhouse minister \nLet’s hope it’s not an omen but when Andrew Percy got the job of Northern Powerhouse minister it seemed even his departmental head didn’t recognise his name. \nAs outgoing James Wharton left, Sajid Javid, the new Communities Secretary decided to tweet his congratulations to . . . Andrew Bridgen. \nJavid quickly deleted the tweet and it was just as well it wasn’t Bridgen who is a long term critic of HS2 , one of the foundation stones of the powerhouse initiative. \nBut all the same it illustrated why a few people were left scratching there heads first as to who Andrew Percy was and why he got the job. \nNot least the man himself, MP for Brigg and Goole since 2010. \nHe seemed to accept the role with a mixture of surprise - when the call came he thought it was a prank - and folksy delight. Dominic Lipinski/PA Wire Sajid Javid, who has been appointed Communities Secretary, originally congratulated the wrong MP on his appointment as Northern Powerhouse Minister \nHe said: “I was at a Bar Mitzvah when my phone rang and it was the Number 10 switchboard. I of course assumed this was a colleague playing a joke, as it is not unusual for pretend calls from Downing Street to come through. \n“So with a bit of disbelief I played along and thought ‘yes yes, of course it’s Downing Street and of course the PM wishes to make me a Minister’. \n“Anyway, it actually turns out that the Prime Minister does indeed wish to make me a Minister in the Department of Communities and Local Government responsible for the Northern Powerhouse.” \nAnd, if social media is to be believed - particularly the new minister’s own social media - he seems a humble type of person. \nHe said on his Facebook page: “As constituents will be aware, I’ve never chased a Ministerial job, I didn’t in the last Parliament and I didn’t in this one! However, we do live in somewhat bizarre times. Anyway, I’ve decided to accept this position and, as a proud Northerner, it is one of the few roles in Government I would actually quite relish.” Read More There is a new Northern Powerhouse minister - so what happens next? \nIn the coin toss of fate that is British politics at the moment, he supported Theresa May in the Tory leadership campaign and won. \nMr Percy celebrated with a McDonald’s - “no fancy lunch for me,” he said before adding he would give the role his “best shot”. \nAnd the role will definitely need his best shot. \nThe Northern Powerhouse idea of devolving powers to the regions was the brainchild of former Chancellor George Osborne, one of the most high profile victim’s of Mrs May’s recent cabinet re-shuffle. Former Northern Powerhouse minister James Wharton \nIn the same re-shuffle Mr Wharton, MP for Stockton South, was moved to a role in the Department for International Development. \nThe North East Combined Authority has already put the region’s devolution deal on hold following Britain’s vote to leave the European Union. \nLeaders of the region’s seven councils chose to freeze discussions over devolution for the North East earlier this month pending further assurances over funding in the aftermath of Brexit. \nThe agreement guarantees £30m a year for the region to spend – in addition to being given control of a £3.4bn pool of investment cash. \nThe North East would also get new powers covering employment and skills, transport and planning and business activity – all intended to drive economic growth. \nNew minister Mr Percy said: “I’ve always championed our area as a backbencher and now I get to champion the North within government.” \nA Government spokesman said: “The Northern Powerhouse will continue to be a priority and Andrew Percy has been appointed Northern Powerhouse Minister. \n“The Government is making huge strides in rebalancing the economy - foreign direct investment has increased by 127% in the two years since the Northern Powerhouse was established.” Read More Doubts over Northern Powerhouse future as new minister is confirmed \nAlthough an unknown quantity, truth be told he has not much to live up to. Mr Wharton always struck commentators as a largely peripheral figure in the whole process, nothing much more than a conduit between the Treasury and NECA. \nIn his short time in Parliament, Mr Percy has revealed himself not to be a simple ‘yes’ man. \nHe has rebelled against the party line on votes, including against Mr Osborne’s March budget when Mr Percy led opposition to the disability cuts. \nBut he arrives at a crucial time for the North East. With the vote to leave the European Union , a huge source of funding is to be cut. \nThe North East gets £430m, or £221 per head, the third highest in England, while the Northern Powerhouse is at risk of “withering” and the Government needs a plan to boost the poorest regions after 2020, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) argued recently. \nThe “Leave” campaign pledged to honour existing EU grants until 2020, including funds for regional development, but the Government should have comprehensive plans in place to help regional economies after that to ensure they do not fall further behind, the JRF argued. \nThere has always been scepticism about whether it will work - a Lib Dem report recently dismissed it as ‘smoke and mirror’s. \nMore specifically “a smokescreen to hide cuts that have been implemented across communities and local government”. Jeremy Middleton who is running as an independent candidate in the North East Mayoral election \nHowever Independent North East Mayoral Candidate Jeremy Middleton is much more positive about the appointment. \nHe said: “The appointment a new Northern Powerhouse minister gives a strong indication that the Government is serious about devolution; now we need to make sure it works for the North East. \n“In light of this, the main threat to devolution in our region is still the local authority leaders who have put it on hold for party political reasons. \n“The new minister isn’t from the North East, so I look forward meeting with him to discuss the needs of the region. As elected mayor I would make the case, that with the right support, the North East can be one of the regions driving the UK’s economic growth .”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-18T17:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-18T19:04:15.955+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
