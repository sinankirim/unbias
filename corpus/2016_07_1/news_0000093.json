Hexham MP Guy Opperman Northumberland MP backs Theresa May to be the next Prime Minister \nHe said: “I’m delighted that the Members of Parliament have put forward Theresa as their overwhelming choice. \n“She is the lady I support and the woman I worked for, for three years in the Home Office from 2012 to 2015. \n“She is a serious woman for a serious time and has accurately been described as Angela Merkel with better shoes. \n“I have great respect for Andrea but I don’t believe she has the experience or the ability of Theresa. And I will be seeking to persuade my members to support Theresa May.” \nWhile Mrs May enjoys a clear advantage among Tories at Westminster, she will be acutely aware that grassroots Conservatives rejected the MPs’ choice in both previous elections conducted under the current system, opting for Iain Duncan Smith and David Cameron over Kenneth Clarke and David Davis. Jonathan Brady/PA Wire Justice Secretary Michael Gove makes a statement outside the Palace of Westminster, in London Read More Which candidate in the Conservative leadership race would be best for North East? \nMrs Leadsom, who played a prominent role in the campaign for Britain to leave the EU, is likely to attract votes from Eurosceptic activists who want a “Brexit prime minister” to oversee withdrawal negotiations. \nAlthough signed up to the Remain camp, Mrs May maintained a low profile during the referendum, and sought to neutralise the issue as she launched her leadership bid by making clear she would not seek to overturn the result and declaring: “Brexit is Brexit.” \nThe new prime minister will be chosen by an electorate of around 150,000 Conservative Party members - but it’s too late to get involved if you’re not already a member, as the deadline for getting a vote by joining the party has already passed. \nMrs May said: “Now it is time for me - and my team - to put my case to the Conservative Party membership. \n“That case comes down to three things. Because we need strong, proven leadership to negotiate the best deal for Britain as we leave the European Union, to unite our party and our country, and to make Britain a country that works not for a privileged few but for every one of us. \n“Those are the things my colleagues have voted for in overwhelming numbers today, and I am confident they will win the support of our members - and the support of the country as a whole.” \nMichael Gove said he was “naturally disappointed” to be eliminated but said his two rivals were both “formidable politicians” who deserved to be in the final run-off, and whichever of them won would “lead the country well”. \nHis campaign has suffered from allegations of treachery, after he switched from backing former London mayor Boris Johnson and announced he was standing himself. Mr Johnson then pulled out of the race.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-07T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-07T20:47:04.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
