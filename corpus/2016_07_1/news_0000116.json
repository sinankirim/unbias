Rui Vieira/PA Wire A Ryanair plane landing \nThe company said there could be further implications if the UK is unable to negotiate access to the single market and the open skies regulatory framework currently in place across the EU. \nHowever, the Irish carrier added that it could benefit if “our UK registered competitors are no longer permitted to operate intra-EU routes, or must divest their majority ownership of EU registered airlines”. \nThe company made the remarks alongside first-quarter results, which saw net income rise 4% to €256m (£214m) and revenue rise 2% to €1.69bn (£1.4bn). \nRyanair said it was hit by market volatility arising from terrorist events and repeated air traffic control strikes in the period, particularly in France, which caused almost 1,000 flight cancellations. \nRobin Byde, analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, said: “The company is cautious on the impact of Brexit and we expect it to continue to offer deep discounts through the rest of the year to keep cabins full. \n“Nonetheless, these results demonstrate the resilience of the Ryanair business model and we expect consensus forecast to be unchanged at this time.” More on the EU Referendum", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-25T19:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-25T20:48:26.726+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
