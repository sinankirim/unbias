David Cameron would stay on as Prime Minister - said the man himself David Cameron leaves Downing Street for the last time as Prime Minister with his wife Samantha Cameron and children Nancy Cameron, Arthur Cameron and Florence Cameron \nIn an interview shortly before the ballot, David Cameron was asked whether he could stay in his post in the event of Brexit. He replied: “Yes. I think it’s very important that the individual careers of individual politicians don’t get caught up in this question.” \nWithin hours of the result, he announced he was quitting. 2. Boris Johnson would become new Prime Minister if there is was a Brexit vote and Cameron quit. Pretty much everybody Boris Johnson \nJohnson was the highest profile Vote Leave campaigner and it was confidently predicted he would replace Cameron if the country voted Brexit. He obviously thought so too, quickly announcing his intention to stand as leader, but was scuppered by his ‘comrade-in-arms’ Michael Gove who said his pal wasn’t up to the job. Johnson, a surprise choice for Foreign Secretary, binned his PM ambitions. For now. 3. Vote Leave said the £350m a week they claimed the UK paid to the EU a day would be diverted to the NHS 2016 Getty Images A 'Vote LEAVE' battle bus \nThe message was on Leave campaign posters - “Let’s give our NHS the £350 million the EU takes every week”. \nIt was emblazoned on the camp’s bus: “We send the EU £350 million a week - let’s fund our NHS instead.” \nHowever, let’s not divert the cash to the NHS seems to be the post-Brexit message. On the morning of June 24 Nigel Farage said it was a mistake to say it in the first place and he wouldn’t have said it, while Iain Duncan Smith said he never said it all. Which clears that up. 4. Immigration will be reduced, said Vote Leave \nMany felt immigration was the Achilles heel of the Remain campaign. Being part of the EU meant freedom of movement for workers from member states. Vote Leave talked tough about reducing immigration giving the impression it was top of their to-do list post Brexit. \nHowever in another June 24 admission, Tory MEP and Vote Leave campaigner Daniel Hannan said: “If people watching think that they have voted and there is now going to be zero immigration from the EU they are going to be disappointed.” \nAnd disappointed many of them are. 5. The refugee camp at Calais would close leading to more illegal immigration to UK - Vote Remain and others Gary Stone Migrants try to storm the the Channel tunnel at Calais \nBefore the vote French politicians, as well Remain campaigners including then PM David Cameron, warned that if Britain voted for a Brexit, then France would relax border controls at Calais and thereby opening Britain up to potentially more risk of illegal immigration. \nCalais is currently to over 7,000 migrants and refugees and that number is expected to exceed 10,000 by the end of September. \nHowever Prime Minister Theresa May has just made a deal with French President Francois Hollande for this not to happen \nBut Mrs May’s deal may only last nine months if unpopular Mr Hollande is thrown out of office during elections in April next year. \nHis rival, French presidential frontrunner Alain Juppe, wants to scrap the Calais border posts. The centre-right Mayor of Bordeaux insisted two weeks ago: “We must move the border back to where it belongs”. 6. The economy would crash. The pound would collapse in value by up to 20% against the dollar and the FTSE 100 would nosedive. Numerous economists Clara Molden/PA Wire A cashier holding a 20 US dollar note, alongside a 10 pound British sterling note \nAt first it seemed this was going to happen as on the day after the vote the pound fell from being worth $1.48 to $1.33, a level not seen since 1985. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 index which on June 23 had stood at 6,338 plunged to 5,982 by June 27, wiping billions off shares. \nToday sterling is worth $1.31 but the FTSE 100 share index has recovered to 6,730, which is 6% up on its pre Brexit close. \nA Bank Of England report on Wednesday said “No clear evidence” exists that the UK’s vote for Brexit last month has triggered a sharp slump in economic fortunes. \nIn a survey reflecting evidence gathered by agents around the country who act as the BoE’s “eyes and ears” on the ground, the bank said companies are more uncertain but are mostly ploughing ahead with expansion plans. \nA third of firms say they will curb hiring and investment relative to pre-referendum intentions, but the rest are unaffected and a majority still intend to fund growth initiatives. Consumer spending also appears to be mostly unaffected, added the report. 7. The Tory party will be torn apart by civil war whichever way the vote went, leaving the way open for Labour \nDavid Cameron said he promised an EU referendum to stop the Tories ‘banging on about Europe’. And now it seems they have. For a few days the party did implode as Mr Cameron quit, then Vote Leave campaigners Boris Johnson and Michael Gove fell out publicly and it all threatened to get nasty. Then in a ruthless leadership contest Theresa May because Prime Minister unopposed after Andrea Leadsom stood down. \nThe biggest hit has been taken by pro Remain Labour whose MPs have used the defeat as another stick to beat leader Jeremy Corbyn with, putting them at odds with the party’s membership in a conflict which has no obvious happy conclusion for the m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-23T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-23T18:14:25.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
