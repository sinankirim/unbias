twice-weekly to Girona in Spain; and five a week to Faro in Portugal. \nIn its first announced schedule for the coming year, the Irish company unveiled the “great news” for North East fliers who will also see an increase in flights and five new summer services next year, bringing its total number of routes to 11. \nThe move is expected to result in three quarters of a million passengers passing through Newcastle International Airport, where on Tuesday morning Ryanair’s head of communications Robin Kiely announced what he said is Newcastle’s biggest summer schedule. \nAnd while voicing concerns over the Brexit fall-out, he added: “The potential for growth in Newcastle and across Europe is huge.” Robin Kiely, Head of communications at Ryanair \nPassengers can also book five new summer services next year: to Gdansk, Warsaw and Wroclaw in Poland; and to Lanzarote and Tenerife in the Canary Islands. And the new schedule also makes the most of the popularity of Spain as a summer destination with sun-seeking Geordies with an increase to now-daily flights to Alicante and five-a-week to Malaga, as well as twice-daily ones to the airline’s home city of Dublin. \nMr Kiely said: “This is the first in Europe to have its summer schedule and it’s great news for Newcastle, Newcastle customers and Ryanair.” \nHe said the boost, set to deliver 750,000 passengers a year in 2017, will also support the 560 jobs at the airport. \nJohn Irving, the airport’s business development manager, said he is “delighted” at the expansion in services and that Ryanair’s biggest ever programme will prove an all-round bonus. \n“I think these popular routes will make a huge difference in the North East,” he said. \nMr Kiely pointed out that the Referendum result has brought uncertainty to the industry. Newcastle International Airport \nHe said Brexit has hit the airline in its competition with budget rival easyJet. \nMarket uncertainty means it will be 18-24 months before it sees how business will be affected by plans to leave Europe so, with regard to plans to increase aircraft numbers, “growth will be in aircraft based outside the UK,” he said. \nHe also has a request for new Theresa May: “scrap air passenger duty”. \nHe said passenger traffic had been hard hit by APD when it was introduced in Ireland - amounting to an individual £13 charge to leave the airport - but numbers had then risen dramatically once the duty was axed by the Irish government. \nHe added that Ryanair, with the lowest fares, is building upon its recent changes, including introduction of a passenger charter, with improvements including a new-look aircraft interior and offers including £19.99 travel on flights booked by July 21. \nThis will involve releasing 100,000 seats for the sale across the airline’s European network, including Newcastle, which can be booked on Ryanair’s website. \nThe 2017 summer services to Lanzarote, Tenerife, Gdansk, Warsaw and the lesser-known Wroclaw - which is Poland’s largest city - are an extension of Ryanair’s current winter service from Newcastle Airport. The new flights will be twice-weekly except for Tenerife where there will be three a week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-19T14:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-19T16:26:58.848+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
