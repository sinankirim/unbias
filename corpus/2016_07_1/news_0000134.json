launches seven figure programme to fuel growth in creative and digital \nGood news from Generator. \nThe creative development agency has launched a seven-figure programme to fuel new growth in the region’s expanding creative and digital sector. \nIt has confirmed its latest award from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and has pledged to use the investment to drive and develop the wider commercial creative and digital industries in the North East.In a bid to place the region at the forefront of the UK’s digital economy. \nThe 30 month ‘Digital Futures’ programme will assist new and existing businesses as well as potential entrepreneurs within the creative and digital industries based in the North East Local Economic Partnership area. \nGenerator, which helped create over 200 jobs and safeguard 151 thanks to its last ERDF backed initiative ending in 2015, has said the future has never been brighter for the region’s emerging sector. \nGenerator CEO, Jim Mawdsley said: “Generator is extremely excited about the latest ERDF award and the prospect of building upon our huge success in the area of business support. ‘Having earned a national reputation for our unique approach to flexible sector specialist business support we will be implementing our techniques and mechanisms sector wide.” Generator CEO, Jim Mawdsley 09:06 Robert Gibson-NEC Revenues down at Immunodiagnostic Systems Holdings \nThe Boldon-based Immunodiagnostic Systems Holdings PLC - a specialist producer of manual and automated diagnostic testing kits and instruments for the clinical market, will today hold its AGM. \nChairman, Dr. Burkhard Wittek, will say: “Group revenue (unaudited) for Q1 FY2017 is £9.5m, 7% lower than for the same period last year. On a like for like basis (i.e. at constant scope and constant exchange rates) the decrease amounted to 11%.” \nAs of June 30, the Group employed 299 people on a full time employment basis. \nClosing cash and cash equivalents on that date were £27.8m. \nDr Wittek will add: “The management team is working hard to correct the causes for the loss of revenues in order to return to a growth trajectory: major projects are the improvement in the sales processes across the organization as well as increasing the output of our assay development group. \n“In addition the company has initiated a program to reduce the cost base by £3m -£4m per year.” Immunodiagnostic Systems' office in Boldon, South Tyneside 09:00 Robert Gibson-NEC Government action needed to stave off construction recession, says FMB \nA significant programme of capital investment by the Government is now needed to tackle the threat of a construction recession - as revealed by the latest statistics from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) - according to the Federation of Master Builders (FMB). \nBrian Berry, Chief Executive of the FMB, said: “The construction industry has grown steadily over the past few years and for the sector to experience two consecutive quarters of negative growth demonstrates the powerful effect uncertainty and a lack of confidence can have. \n“The Government must now take bold action and do everything in its power to prevent these preliminary estimates by the ONS from becoming more concrete or sustained. \n“A firm commitment to invest public funds in capital projects such as house building and infrastructure would go a long way to assuaging fears that demand will dive in the wake of Brexit. \n“The country’s housing crisis and the enormous skills shortage our sector faces owe much to how the construction industry suffered during the last economic downturn – it’s pivotal that we learn from those mistakes and find a way to keep Britain building.” Brian Berry, chief executive of the Federation of Master Builders 08:55 Robert Gibson-NEC No further info available just yet, Lloyds says \nJust spoke to someone at the Lloyds Banking Group press office. \nAs yet, the company can not confirm where the closures or jobs losses are likely to be. \nHe also told me the decision won’t be made ‘on a regional basis’ but will take a lot of factors into account. \nWe’ll keep you posted as further details become available. 08:47 Robert Gibson-NEC 3,000 jobs to go at Lloyds \nLloyds Banking Group is cutting 3,000 jobs and shutting 200 branches as the lender braces for a cut in interest rates following Britain’s decision to quit the European Union.The part state-backed bank said a cost-cutting programme announced in 2014 will be extended and the “expected lower for longer interest rate environment” will see the new cuts come into effect by the end of 2017.The Bank of England is widely expected to cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% next week as the fallout from the Brexit vote intensifies.Lloyds is targeting £1.4 billion in cost savings by the end of next year.The bank made the announcement alongside results for the first half of the year, which saw statutory profits more than double to £2.5 billion, but the lender warned that Brexit could have an adverse impact on its future performance.“Given the uncertainty, it is too early to determine the impact on our formal longer term guidance at this stage. However, while the business will remain highly capital generative, it is possible that this capital generation may be somewhat lower in future years than previously guided,” the bank said. Lloyds Bank is cutting 3,000 jobs 08:45 Robert Gibson-NEC Sage and the stars \nAt the Sage Summit, Marc Scheipe, the company’s North America president, has interviewed actors/businesswomen Gwyneth Paltrow and Zooey Deschanel, both of whom emphasised the importance of partnership working. \nCuriously, Ms Paltrow also said she hopes people forget she had anything to do with Goop. \nMore on that later - and hopefully a better picture. Marc Scheipe of Sage with Gwyneth Paltrow and Zooey Deschanel 08:40 Robert Gibson-NEC Shell profits tumble by 72% amid low oil and gas prices \nRoyal Dutch Shell has reported a 72% plunge in profits for the second quarter as the energy giant continues to be hit by low oil and gas prices.The firm said adjusted earnings tumbled from 3.76 billion US dollars (£2.85 billion) to 1.05 billion US dollars (£800 million) as chief executive Ben van Beurden flagged the “significant challenge” lower energy costs are posing.He said: “Downstream and integrated gas businesses contributed strongly to the results, alongside Shell’s self-help programme. However, lower oil prices continue to be a significant challenge across the business, particularly in the upstream.“We are managing the company through the down-cycle by reducing costs, by delivering on lower and more predictable investment levels, executing our asset sales plans and starting up profitable new projects.” 08:28 Robert Gibson-NEC And there's new Sage X3 update... \nAt the Summit, Sage also reported on the continued success of the Sage X3 business management solution, launching the new Sage X3 cloud release Update 10, and a growing ecosystem of cloud applications. \nAt last year’s Sage Summit, Sage CEO Stephen Kelly announced the end of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), stating it was often synonymous with ‘Expense, Regret & Pain’ for business users. \nSince last year, Sage X3 has delivered faster, simpler and more flexible business management to mid-sized enterprise customers, dramatically cutting the cost and complexity of typical enterprise ERP systems. \nAs a result, Sage X3 saw its customer base grow by more than 29% globally since last year’s product update. \nThe new Sage X3 Update 10, available to Cloud customers in August, further improves the solution functionality and user experience. 08:25 Robert Gibson-NEC Sage One and Sage Live optimise for iOS \nAt the Sage Summit in Chicago, the Newcastle-based Sage Group has announced that Sage One and Sage Live are now optimised for iOS, Apple’s mobile operating system. \nSage has become part of the Apple Mobility Partner Program. \nBoth Sage One and Sage Live support partners and accountants, with the now-iOS- optimized versions enabling customers using iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch for day-to- day business processes to work while on the move. \nSage has worked with Apple to completely redesign user interfaces. \nSage CEO Stephen Kelly, said: “Mobility is at the heart of business transformation, and we’re just scratching the surface of its potential. \n“As a mobility partner, Sage has worked closely with software and design experts at Apple to fine tune and optimize the Sage One and Sage Live experiences for iOS, as well as create an exciting new Apple Watch application. \n“By creating beautiful easy-to- use applications, we’re able to maintain the best user experience that customers love, giving business owners peace of mind that their workflow will not be interrupted.” Stephen Kelly 08:16 Robert Gibson-NEC Turbo Power Systems achieves 'milestone' \nThe Gateshead-based Turbo Power Systems has enjoyed another strong quarter, with order intake for the three months to June 30 hitting £6.77m, compared to £3.72m in the same period the previous year. \nNet profit, meanwhile, grew year-on-year by 102% to £160,000. \nThe performance has contributed to a half-year order intake of £8.75m, compared to £4.13m in 2015. \nNet profit decreased 85% to £200,000. However, this was mainly due to contract signing delays and re-scheduling of past contracts. \nCEO Carlos Neves said: “Our main goal was to continue improving our performance and the results achieved in the first half of 2016 are fully in line with management expectations. They represent an important milestone under the challenges we have for 2016, moreover considering the uncertainties about the ultimate outcome of the Strategic Review and the Brexit short term impacts on our customers and suppliers business plans. \n“The hard work of our employees, in all areas, has demonstrated that the trend to profitability achieved last year could be maintained while we keep reinforcing the pillars for our continuous growth. The increasing order intake in the first six months on 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 together with the benefits derived from the efficiencies in cost control and the new R&D developments are now underpinning future growth. \n“I remain confident that we will continue to deliver our commitments in 2016 and with the new orders received, and expected to be received, reinforce and refine the successful strategy of turnaround with limited resources.” 08:07 Robert Gibson-NEC Strong results for intu \nRetail firm intu, which owns both Eldon Square in Newcastle and the Metrocentre in Gateshead, has reported strong results for the six months ended June 30, 2016. \nDuring the period, the company saw like-for-like rental income increase by 7.5%, reflecting increased occupancy, improving rental levels from new letting and rent reviews, and the benefits of unit reconfigurations. \nIt signed 98 long-term leases, 82 in the UK and 16 in Spain, for £17m of new annual rent, and increased occupancy from 95.1% to 96.1% year-on-year. \nFootfall, meanwhile, grew 1.3% compared to a 1.7% fall in the national Experian retail average. \nThe half-year also saw £23m being spent on active asset management projects, including the completion of catering development at intu Metrocentre, where nine restaurants have been added. \nintu is likewise on target to open 20 new restaurants at Eldon Square in the Autum, with 19 having be pre-let. \nChief executive David Fischel said: “We are pleased to report a strong set of results for the first six months of 2016 with a 10 per cent increase in underlying earnings per share driven by excellent growth in net rental income of 7.5 per cent on a like-for-like basis. We have therefore raised our guidance for full year like-for-like net rental income growth to 3 to 4 per cent. \n“Letting activity was also very positive leading to an improved occupancy ratio of 96 per cent. Our established retailers, such as Zara and Next, have been upsizing space and we have welcomed new lifestyle brands and international retailers at a time when the supply of quality retail space is limited. We continue to focus on strengthening and improving our prime regional shopping centres, introducing new leisure concepts and increasing the dwell time of our 400 million customer visits per year. \n“With over £500 million of cash and available facilities, we are well positioned to take opportunities when they arise, such as the acquisition in the period of the other half of intu Merry Hill which adds to the considerable momentum from our active asset management and development projects, both in the UK and Spain.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-28T09:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-28T12:44:28.977+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
