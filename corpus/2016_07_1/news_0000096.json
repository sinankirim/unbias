Comments (1) \nA high street law firm is putting its \"aggressive\" expansion plans on hold in light of the Brexit vote. \nEdward Hands and Lewis (EHL) has paused plans for a new branch in Birstall and for three other offices which were in early negotiations. \nThe firm, based in Loughborough Road, Belgrave, has also made seven redundancies and closed a call handling operation. \nSenior partner Jason Hathaway said taking stock after swift expansion was the right thing to do in the current uncertain market. \nHe said the decision to take a more cautious approach was made at a board meeting the Monday after the Brexit vote. \nThe firm pulled the Birstall office deal the next day – refitting new offices and bringing in staff costs the firm in the region of £100,000. \nMr Hathaway said staff had been reassured that the business was on a sound footing and was still recruiting in other areas. \nThe fundamental principle of creating a strong high street brand, he said, was still in place. \nEHL has 154 staff and 15 offices including new branches in Hinckley, Oadby and Beeston, Notts. \nIts push for growth on the high street has seen turnover grow from £4.8 million to £6.5 million in a year. \nMr Hathaway said: \"We had a vision to have 50 offices by 2020, and have pulled the plug on that vision. \n\"It was based on the expectation that the economy would grow and we do not now forecast that huge growth in the economy. \n\"I still believe in building a high street brand, but the focus is on building a strong business and putting our resources into that and not pursuing our aggressive growth strategy. \n\"If we had stayed in the EU there would have been a bounce – the Bank of England had forecast 2 per cent growth but is now forecasting marginal growth, and some are saying recession. \n\"There is a potential slowing down of the property market. On the commercial side we are seeing businesses delaying decisions. \n\"We are simply saying we can't make a commitment to opening branches because the world has changed. \n\"The UK economy has had a seismic shift and we have to respond. \n\"As a consequence we have reviewed our growth strategy which has resulted in some positions within the business being looked at and some people have been let go.\" \nHe said one person had gone from a call centre in Leicester, and another four had been relocated. \nThe business has also lost a couple of conveyancing roles, a paralegal and a handful of administrative roles. \nIt is also shutting a serviced office in Bromborough in the Wirral after deciding not to replace a conveyancer and two other staff who quit the firm last month. \nMr Hathaway said expansion could get back on track if a new Prime Minster was able to negotiate a good deal with Europe and bring confidence back to the economy. \nHe said: \"Where we have got offices we are investing to build them up to our model and will continue that.\" \nHe said a new commercial office in Leicester with 16 staff was doing well, and property work in London had been brisk thanks to a \"big increase\" in overseas buyers after the value of sterling dropped.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-12T08:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-12T09:36:23.709+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
