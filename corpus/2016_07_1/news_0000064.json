Separate schemes also give young people in vocational training the opportunity to do apprenticeships abroad. Lib Dem councillor Wendy Taylor \nNewcastle Lib Dem spokesperson Coun Dr Wendy Taylor said: “Thousands of students starting university in the North East’s five universities and a number of colleges in September will be hoping for the chance to take part in this scheme. \n“Young people overwhelmingly voted remain in the EU and it would be wrong to deprive them of this once in a lifetime opportunity to study or train abroad. \n“The philosopher Erasmus said 500 years ago 'I am a citizen of the world'. \n“Today’s students were born as citizens of the UK and the EU, and the 21st century economy demands that we continue to produce highly-skilled young people with experience of other languages and countries. \n“The Liberal Democrats are calling on the government and EU leaders to confirm that they will be to access the Erasmus scheme whatever happens next.” Read More EU referendum: How will Brexit affect North East universities? \nAfter the referendum result was announced, North East universities were quick to reassure students that nothing would immediately change for EU nationals studying in the region, or home students currently using the Erasmus scheme. \nIn the long term, it is not clear how the scheme will be affected by Brexit, but some non-EU countries are currently involved. \nThese include Turkey, Iceland and Norway.
