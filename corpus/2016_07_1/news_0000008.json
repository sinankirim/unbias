What exactly is the Northern Powerhouse? \nThe brainchild of former Chancellor George Osborne, who talked of a revolution in the way England was governed. The aim is to boost economic growth in the North, particularly in the “Core Cities” group which includes Newcastle, through better transport links and increased powers to rebalance the UK economy away from London and the South East. So why has it been thrown into doubt? \nBrexit was the first thing that caused uncertainty to stir. \nThe North East’s devolution deal depended largely on EU funding - with that gone, there was a huge question mark about where the money would now come from. \nAnd Mr Osborne’s removal from the treasury hasn’t helped matters. \nIt was his idea and now he has gone it faces an uncertain future. Who is the new Northern Powerhouse minister? \nAndrew Percy has taken over from James Wharton, who has been given a new job in the Department for International Development. \nMr Percy is the MP for Brigg and Goole and has promised to champion the North. \nHe said: “I hope having served 10 years as a local Councillor before becoming an MP, I also have something to contribute on the local government front. I’ve always championed our area as a backbencher and now I get to champion the North within government.” So, what happens next? \nThe truth is, nobody knows. \nNECA - the North East Combined Authority - met earlier this month and decided to put our region’s devolution on hold. \nLeaders of the region’s seven councils chose to freeze discussions over devolution for the North East while they seek further assurances over funding in the aftermath of the EU referendum result. \nThe agreement guarantees £30m a year for the region to spend – in addition to being given control of a £3.4bn pool of investment cash. \nBut the sacking of Mr Osborne coupled with Mr Wharton’s departure means the picture is as unclear as ever.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-17T19:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-17T19:59:48.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
