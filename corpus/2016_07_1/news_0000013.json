In theory, the amount lost could be far more. \nThe Leicester and Leicestershire Enterprise Partnership (LLEP), which helps promote the multi-million pound funding programme in the city and county, said where contracts were already in place it was business as usual. \nBut it is waiting to hear if the programme will be halted by the Government as ministers decide what happens next – and whether there would be sufficient funding for new contracts to continue once they begin. Nick Rushton \nCounty council leader Nick Rushton said he hoped the Government would eventually step in with new support programmes, re-allocating cash that would have gone into the EU. \nHe hoped EU subsidies for farmers under the Common Agricultural Policy would be replaced in a similar way. \nESIF funding is intended for organisations such as the Growth Accelerator and Manufacturing Advisory Service, the city council Leicester Energy Agency, Voluntary Action Leicester and the LLEP Gateway, which all provide support services for business. \nBusinesses which benefited directly from these types of funding streams in the past have included Geary's Bakeries, Clifton Packaging and King Trailers. \nLLEP chief executive Corin Crane said: \"From a Government perspective it's business as usual. \n\"The Government has not changed and we have not signed Article 50 and there is still a manifesto to deliver. \n\"But clearly there will be an impact on the European fund and where the Government sees its priorities. \n\"If Article 50 is launched soon, in theory at least, half of the programme will have no money, but we are looking for Government assurances that these programmes will be extended. \n\"This money plays a critical part in the local economy, because it is focused on those businesses and individuals most at need. It's essential that if we do lose the money the Government replaces that with domestic funds.\" \nCorin Crane \nCoun Rushton, who is on the LLEP board, said it seemed clear the ESIF money would stop along with EU farming subsidies. \nHe said the Government had to decide what its funding priorities were. \nCoun Rushton said: \"As part of the negotiations, the Government would have to decide if it wanted to fund things like this with the money it will no longer be sending to Brussels. \n\"There will be new funds which can be bid into which may well be a better reflection of what the people of this country want. It could actually be good news.\" \nThe LLEP has already voiced concern about the medium and long-term impact on local companies following the Brexit vote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-05T11:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-05T12:10:30.708+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
