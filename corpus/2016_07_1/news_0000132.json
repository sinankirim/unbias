Related content \nMr Crane came to Leicester two years ago , with the aim of making the LLEP more user-friendly for small businesses. \nHe has played a lead part in local initiatives such as the two-week Leicester Business festival , which takes place again this autumn, and the bid for a new hi-tech enterprise zone in Leicester and Loughborough. \nHe is also chair of the European Structural Funds Committee that oversees the management of around £90 million of funding aimed at SME business growth and skills work. \nBefore joining the LLEP he was head of economic partnerships and inward investment at Wolverhampton City Council. \nHe said: \"I am really proud to be taking up this role as chief executive at the Black Country Chamber of Commerce.\"I know the area well and understand what a diverse and entrepreneurial cluster of businesses are based there, with such a clear sense of identity. \n\"I also know that for all the opportunities there are at the moment for forward looking businesses, there are also a huge amount of challenges from Brexit, from a slow-down in manufacturing, imports being hit by a weaker pound and foreign investors delaying decisions in an uncertain political environment. \n\"The chamber has a long history of supporting businesses to seize opportunities regardless of national economic trends and in making the business voice heard at every level of decision makers. \n\"I'm looking forward to working with the chamber team and Black Country businesses to continue to do all this and more.\" \nAdrian Wright, Black Country Chamber of Commerce president, said: \"I am thrilled with the appointment of Corin Crane as the new Black Country Chamber chief executive. \n\"Corin can really help build for the future by creating a bigger and stronger Chamber to support local businesses. \n\"He also has a wealth of experience and knowledge to bring to his new role which will help to continue the great work the chamber team is doing.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-18T13:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-18T14:14:46.399+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
