How the proposed expansion at Silverlink Point 8.32 Coreena Ford Hammond on Twitter - ARM Holdings reaction 8.28 Coreena Ford Wet weather and Brexit contribute to shopping data decline \nAnother Brexit-related tale.. \nThe number of shoppers on the country’s streets saw the sharpest fall in more than two years in June, as the economic uncertainty surrounding the EU referendum vote and the wet weather took its toll. \nThe British Retail Consortium (BRC)/Springboard Footfall and Vacancies Monitor said total UK retail footfall was down by 2.8% in June on a year ago, marking the biggest decline since February 2014. \nThe report said footfall had been rising at the start of June - but in the week of the referendum and afterwards footfall declined as consumer confidence was hit - despite retailers offering discounts in early season sales. \nFootfall in retail parks fell by 1% year-on-year, following a 1% increase in May. \nIt marks the first decline in footfall in retail parks since December 2013 and the deepest decline for this sector since November 2013. \nHigh street footfall was down by 3.7% year-on-year in June, while footfall in shopping centres fell by 2.3% over the same period. \nThe latest report covers footfall between May 29 and July 2. 8.21 Coreena Ford ARM Holdings - the chairman's reaction \nStuart Chambers, chairman of ARM Holdings, said the offer was “compelling” for shareholders. \nHe said: \nThe board of ARM is reassured that ARM will remain a very significant UK business and will continue to play a key role in the development of new technology. \nSoftBank has given assurances that it will invest considerably in the business, including doubling the UK headcount over the next five years and maintaining ARM’s unique culture and business model. \nARM is an outstanding company with an exceptional track record of growth. The board believes that by accessing all the resources that SoftBank has to offer, ARM will be able to further accelerate the use of ARM-based technology wherever computing happens. \nMasayoshi Son, chairman and chief executive of SoftBank, said the investment marked its strong commitment to the UK and the “competitive advantage” of the science and technology industries in Cambridge. \nHe said: \nWe have long admired ARM as a world-renowned and highly respected technology company that is by some distance the market-leader in its field. \nThis is one of the most important acquisitions we have ever made, and I expect ARM to be a key pillar of SoftBank’s growth strategy going forward. 8.15 Coreena Ford Chancellor Philip Hammond welcomes ARM Holdings deal \nChancellor Philip Hammond said the £24 billion investment “would be the largest ever from Asia into the UK”. \nHe said: \nIt would guarantee to double the number of jobs in ARM in the UK over the next five years and turn this great British company into a global phenomenon. \nJust three weeks after the referendum decision, it shows that Britain has lost none of its allure to international investors. \nBritain is open for business - and open to foreign investment. \nSoftbank’s decision confirms that Britain remains one of the most attractive destinations globally for investors to create jobs and wealth. And as ARM’s founders will testify, this is the greatest place in the world to start and grow a technology business.

SoftBank also pledged to retain the existing management team and invest further in the business, increasing staff numbers outside the UK over the next five years. \nThe acquisition has seen shares in ARM valued at 1,700 pence, with the company being priced at £24.3 billion. \nARM, which supplies technology for Apple’s iPhone, saw rising profits in April as it outpaced the market thanks to strong demand for its products. The combined group hope the acquisition will allow it to capitalise on opportunities in the “internet of things” - giving every day objects a connection to the internet. SoftBank said it intends to continue a partnership-based business model and that a doubling of the UK workforce will allow ARM to continue to develop leading-edge technology in the UK. \nARM’s directors will recommend the deal is accepted by ARM shareholders at its forthcoming general meeting. 8.07 Coreena Ford FTSE and pound latest \nThe FTSE-100 index opened at 6669.24. \nThe pound at 8am was 1.3224 dollars compared to 1.3192 dollars at the previous close.

The UK government will need to quickly introduce measures to help offset Brexit blues, support the economy and continue to attract foreign investment. \nWhile investors value the UK’s access to the single market, we shouldn’t lose sight that they also rate the UK’s quality of life, diversity and culture, education, stability of social climate, telecommunications, and labour skills highly. These underlying fundamentals have not changed. \nThe focus now needs to be on making sure that the UK negotiates the right trade deals that will allow access to key markets. There are numerous opportunities for the economy to remain not only open for business but also attractive, competitive and connected. \nRead the rest of the story here . Mark Hatton, from Ernst and Young, in Newcastle 8.05 Coreena Ford Top story - \"Anaemic\" growth in UK economy forecast for next three years \nThe UK economy is heading for a “challenging” time with action needed to offset issues caused by the decision to leave the EU , according to two leading economic forecasts. \nThe ITEM Club summer forecast from accountancy group EY said the post-referendum economy will take a very different path to the one expected three months ago, with a drop in confidence affecting both consumer spending and business investment. \nThe drop in confidence was also reported in the Deloitte CFO survey, which found ‘significant downturns in corporate optimism and risk appetite’ among the chief financial officers of the UK’s largest companies. \nEY said the slump in the pound will cushion some of those problems by boosting exports, but this will not be enough to prevent a “significant deterioration in the UK’s growth outlook”. \nDavid Sproul, senior partner and chief executive of Deloitte, said: \nThe outcome of the EU referendum has triggered a sharp, negative response from the corporate sector. \nThis survey was conducted immediately after the referendum, against a backdrop of historical political upheaval and financial uncertainty. \nThe faster-than-expected appointment of a new Prime Minister removes one source of uncertainty, now the Government must set out its vision for the UK’s future relationship with the EU to provide further stability and reassurance. 8.00 Coreena Ford Good morning... \nMorning all, and welcome to another week of breakfast blogs with me in the hot seat... \nI’m Coreena Ford and I’ll be bringing you updates on breaking national, regional and maybe even some international business news from 8am to 9.30am. \nA quick check on the LSE this morning shows no updates for any North East businesses, but there are some national announcements, the biggest one being news of a Cambridge firm which is being acquired by a Japanese firm for a whopping £23bn. No surprise to hear that directors are recommending shareholders accept that offer... \nElsewhere we have warnings from EY that the economy should brace itself for a “severe loss of momentum” following the Brexit vote, as well as a similar survey from Deloitte. Business editor Graeme Whitfield has spoken to Mark Hatton from EY on this issue, so more on that in a short while. \nI’m also going to give you a flavour of what to expect from us news-wise over the course of the day, and remind you of some of our bigger stories. \nIf you’d like to contribute to the live blog, tweet at @jnlbusiness to share your stories, opinions and images. \nAlternatively you can drop me a line at coreena.ford@ncjmedia.co.uk or tweet me at @Scoopford", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-18T09:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-18T11:16:04.630+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
