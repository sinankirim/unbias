Andrew Milligan/PA Wire GlaxoSmithKline CEO Sir Andrew Witty \nAround £74m will also invested at the firm’s site in Ware, where additional manufacturing capacity will be created. \nGlaxoSmithKline currently employs 16,000 people in the UK, 6,000 of whom work in manufacturing across a total of nine bases. \nMost of the products made at the expanded facilities will be exported. \nMr Witty said: “Today’s announcement reflects further investment to support our pharmaceutical pipeline and meet growing demand for our innovative portfolio of newly launched products. \n“It is testament to our skilled UK workforce and the country’s leading position in life sciences that we are making these investments in advanced manufacturing here. \n“From their manufacture in the UK, many of these medicines will be sent to patients around the world.” \nBusiness and energy secretary Greg Clark said: “An investment of this scale is a clear vote of confidence in Britain and underlines our position as a global business leader. \n“GSK’s recognition of our skilled workforce, world leading scientific capabilities and competitive tax environment is further proof that there really is no place better in Europe to grow a business.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-27T14:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-27T13:17:21.159+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
