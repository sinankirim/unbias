As he prepares to step down, he tells Graeme Whitfield about what he has achieved. \nIn June 2006, South African academic Chris Brink made his pitch to be vice chancellor of Newcastle University. Unusually, we know what he said. \nProf Brink revealed the thinking that got him the job almost a decade to the day on from that interview when he joined Newcastle City Council leader Nick Forbes to welcome a £65m investment by insurance group Legal & General into Science Central, the scheme the council and the university had been working to bring to fruition for the best part of 12 years. \n“I said I wanted Newcastle to be a world-class civic university,” he said - a theme he resumes now as he begins the countdown to the end of his time at Newcastle. \nNext Monday the university will announce Prof Brink’s replacement as vice-chancellor and he will leave the job entirely at the end of this year. \nBut the pitch he made to get the job in 2006 is still his overarching vision for what a university in a city like Newcastle should be. Professor Chris Brink, Vice Chancellor of Newcastle University \n“World class civic university, that’s the mantra,” he says. “It’s a key idea that comes in various articulations. \n“One is world class civic university, excellent with a purpose is another, but my favourite way of phrasing is the two key questions we ask of our academic work: the first is ‘What are we good at?’, and the second is ‘What are we good for?’ \n“What I’d like to think is that this idea, being able to say both of those things, that has sunk in to the DNA of the institution. Most staff members and many students would able to say and give us some articulation along those lines. To me that’s very satisfying, because 10 years on it’s still the same idea and it’s become the institutional ethos. \n“Most universities would unthinkingly focus on the first question: what are we good at? Because that’s a very important part of what we do. What changed here is that we gave equal billing to the second question, which many universities still don’t. \n“We not only grapple with that question of ‘what are we good for?’, we give it equal weight. \n“So when we ask what are we good at, that usually comes in terms of academic esteem. It’s subjects and research and academic citations. They’re really important and we play in that game as much as anybody. \n“The difference is that we say that isn’t the only thing we want to focus on. We also want to think about what the university is good for, what contribution does it make to the city and the region and civil society generally. \n“We want to look at all the big challenges facing society and ask which are the ones we can make a contribution to.” \nAn obvious example of the university making that contribution is the Science Central site. First envisaged before Prof Brink had even come to Newcastle, the science site is still mostly empty, not least because the abolition of regional development agency One North East meant that the university and the council lost not just the third partner in the scheme, but the partner that was going to actually fund it. \nBut after years of inactivity, plans have been announced for major centres tackling issues around the ageing population, smart data and sustainability. \nProf Brink’s time at the university has also seen a major building programme. His own office moved from a dilapidated old terrace close to Exhibition Park to a room in the King’s Gate building that, symbolically, commands views of the Civic Centre and Newcastle city centre. Academic and accommodation buildings have been upgraded or replaced and an effort made to make the university feel like a coherent city centre campus, rather than a “collection of buildings with roads and car parks in the middle”. \nDoes the university’s role in the region also extend to doing more to taking in more children from the North East, and widening participation in higher education, I ask. \nHe says: “We do very well against national benchmarks for recruiting on our own patch. There’s all sort of things we’re measured on for widening participation - kids from less affluent areas, kids who are the first generation of their family to go to university. In those criteria we do very well in the North East. \n“But because we’re also a major national university most of our students come from outside the North East and the simple fact is that it tends to be more affluent students who travel. So when you add it all together, we sometimes don’t quite meet the benchmarks. We have over 100 schools in our Partners programme and all our North East statistics show that we way-outperform our benchmarks. \n“I like the mix we have. We take about 70% of our students from outside the North East and yet when they graduate, just under half take their first jobs here. So we’re a net importer of talent.” \nAmong that talent - both in terms of its students and its staff - are the best part of 2,000 people from Europe. \nBefore the referendum Prof Brink was among many university vice-chancellors calling for Britain to stay in the EU and he contacted staff and students after the vote to reassure Europeans that nothing would change for them in the short term. He has been vocal in saying Newcastle should project itself, post-Brexit, as a welcoming city and the university has told European students due to start degrees next year that they still pay fees at EU rates, rather than the higher fees paid by international (non-EU) students. \n“For universities this will have a major impact,” he says. “We have about 1,200 European Union students, just under 600 EU staff, academics and researchers. Psychologically, they suddenly wonder, are they welcome here? \n“I’m an immigrant myself. This city, this region, this country, we’re going to have to make clear that people are welcome here and we value their contribution. It’s not so much an immigration debate, it’s a debate about skills and talents, which the university and the city and the region can ill afford to lose. \n“Before the referendum something like 90% of people in higher education said they wanted to remain. The vote has been taken and we all accept it but if we want a knowledge-based economy, if we want our universities to do well internationally, we need a free flow of talent.” \nProf Brink’s time at Newcastle also saw the introduction of £9,000 tuition fees as the Government switched the cost of higher education from the taxpayer generally to those actually going to university. \nThat switch probably accelerated some of the university’s moves to upgrade its facilities, but Prof Brink believes students’ expectations of the university experience were already rising. \nAnd, as he heads into the last few months of his time in charge of Newcastle University, he is passionate in his defence of the idea that higher education should not be driven purely by market forces. \n“I remain firmly of the belief that universities are a public good,” he says. “If we lean too heavily on the principle of private benefit there’s a risk of that ethos deteriorating. Through our civic university ethos I’d like to think we do our bit and more. \n“It’s wise to keep in mind that most universities will outlast most governments. Universities can and should think on a longer timeframe. \n“The political timeframe is always the next election or, in this case, the next crisis. I think we have tried and will continue to try to think on a longer timeframe. Over time if you have core ideas, like public good, civic benefit and so on, they recur.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-03T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-03T14:16:56.958+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
