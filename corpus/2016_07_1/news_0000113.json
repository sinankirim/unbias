Find out with our step-by-step guide 13:30, 22 Jul 2016 If you do qualify you can keep your rights as an EU citizen in the UK even post-Brexit, as Mike Kelly explains Shares Get daily news by email An Irish passport \nOne month on from the historic European Referendum vote things have calmed down - slightly - and the country is slowly coming to terms with the fact there is no turning back. \nThe clock is now ticking and Brexit is coming. But, while the UK has to leave Europe and lose all the benefits that come with being an EU member state, some individuals might not. \nThe North East has been a magnet for Irish immigrants since the 19th century, so there’s a fair chance a number of people reading this might have family from the Emerald Isle. \nIf so, that could be good news because you might qualify for an Irish passport safeguarding your EU citizenship. Tim Rooke-Pool/Getty Images A pint of Guinness \nTo find out if you qualify, read on... \nAlthough I was born in the North East, I love Guinness, Riverdance and the Pogues, so does that make me Irish? \nIt’s a touch more complicated than that but the good news is even though you weren’t born in Ireland that doesn’t automatically disqualify you from becoming an Irish citizen by getting an Irish passport. We’re here to find out if that applies to you. So, tell me a bit about yourself. \nWell I’m a Gemini, I like going to nightclubs... \nI mean specifically about your family. Where were they born? \nI get you. If my mum or dad is Irish, I’ll qualify for an Irish passport? \nHallelujah, as U2 once sang. If you were born outside Ireland and if either of your parents was an Irish citizen who was born in Ireland, then you are entitled to Irish citizenship, and entitled to apply for an Irish passport under Irish law, irrespective of where you live. \nWhat if the parent I’m relying on wasn’t born in Ireland? \nIf at least one of your parents was an Irish citizen but not by birth, ie by naturalisation or marriage, you can become an Irish citizen after registering your birth on the Foreign Births Register, at www.dfa.ie \nSo I can only qualify through my parents then? \nNo. If one of your grandparents is an Irish citizen who was born in Ireland you can become an Irish citizen too. You will need to have your birth registered in the Foreign Births Register - see the link above. \nI’m probably pushing it but what about if I lived with my parents - who aren’t Irish - in Ireland for a time? \nIf your parents were foreign nationals legally resident in Ireland for three out of the four years prior to your birth, you are entitled to citizenship. \nInteresting. Come to think of it, I’m sure I have an Uncle Paddy somewhere. Does he count? \nNow you’re pushing it. You cannot claim Irish citizenship on the basis that relations like a cousin, aunt or uncle was an Irish citizen if none of your parents or grandparents was an Irish citizen at the time of your birth. \nJust a thought. I suppose I better get cracking now we’re out of the EU then? \nThere’s no immediate rush. As Corporal Jones would say, ‘Don’t panic!’ \nWho? \nNever mind. The withdrawal of the UK from the EU will take at least two years during which time UK passport holders will continue to enjoy the rights of EU citizens including free movement within it. \nHang on - I think there’s some Scottish blood in my family. Isn’t Scotland trying to go solo so Brexit doesn’t apply there? How do I qualify for a Scottish passport? \nWell if there is another Scottish independence referendum and this time it goes the SNP’s way, then it successfully negotiates a deal to get into the EU in its own right, we’ll talk then. By which time the UK might be back in the EU anyway. But in the mean time, sláinte. \nSláinte?", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-22T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-22T16:05:19.077+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
