to draw today’s blog to a close. . . \nSee you back here tomorrow morning! 9.28 Coreena Ford FTSE and Pound latest... \nThe pound at 9am was 1.3096 dollars compared to 1.3125 dollars at the previous close. The euro at 9am was 0.8396 pounds compared to 0.8385 pounds at the previous close. \nThe FTSE-100 index at 8:45am was up 23.62 at 6720.99. 9.24 Coreena Ford Online fashion firm Pink Boutique expands again \nCongrats to Alice Hall’s online fashion firm which is expanding once again. \nThe fashion entrepreneur started selling clothes with an initial investment of £90 announced major expansion plans as well as a recruitment drive. \nPink Boutique, set up by Alice Hall four years ago, is growing its workforce to 52 to meet growing demand for online sales of its glamorous womenswear. \nThe e-retail firm may have started with just a £90 investment but it has grown to annual turnover of £7m, shipping 2,000 garments every day. \nNow the business is building its own photographic studio to showcase its collections. \nRead all about Alice’s story here . Alice Hall, founder of Pink Boutique 9.16 Coreena Ford Could you be the next North East Business Executive of the Year. . .? \nThe search is on to find the most inspiring leaders from the North East’s business community - starting in Tyneside and Northumberland . \nThe North East Business Executive of the Year Awards are run by The Journal and our sister paper on Teesside, The Gazette, and aim to recognise the business leaders who have done the most to help the region prosper. \nFind out more about this year’s awards here , and the focus on the Tyneside and Northumberland round of the competition. Last year's winner of the Tyneside and Northumberland Business Executive of the Year - and the overall winner - winner David Laws, who was chief Executive of Newcastle International Airport at the time, with Hugh Welch, Senior Partner, Muckle LLP 9.11 Coreena Ford Workers using own cars claim £5.5bn in mileage claims \nI’ve just come across this interesting slice of statistics. . \nEmployers are spending £5.5 billion each year in mileage claims and vehicle allowances for staff who use their own cars for work, according to a new study. The UK’s so-called grey fleet consists of 14 million vehicles which are mostly older, dirtier and less safe than company cars, researchers found. \nThe report, produced by the Energy Saving Trust (EST) and commissioned by trade body the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association (BVRLA), found that companies could reduce their emissions and cut costs if they switched to car clubs, lease vehicles or public transport. \nEmployee-owned cars used for work make up some of the oldest in the UK, with an average age of 8.2 years, the study claimed. \nIt stated that cutting the number of such vehicles by just 15% would result in a reduction in emissions equivalent to taking 225,000 cars off the road permanently. \nEmployees are often reimbursed on a pence per miles basis in return for using their own vehicle and many receive an allowance if they do not have a company car. Researchers found that private sector firms fork out almost £5 billion each year in costs associated with the business use of cars owned by their staff, while the public sector pays £786 million. 9.07 Coreena Ford Halifax, Nationwide Building Society and TSB are gaining ground . . . \nBack to the data suggesting that Halifax, Nationwide Building Society and TSB are gaining ground in the battle to win current account customers’ business. \nThe figures show that Halifax made a net gain of over 31,000 customers in the fourth quarter of 2015, up from just over 11,000 the previous quarter. \nRussell Galley, managing director at Halifax, highlighted the success of its reward current account, which gives eligible customers £5 a month, as well as a £100 bonus to switch. \nNationwide Building Society made a net gain of 26,000 customers, up from 15,000 in the previous quarter, while TSB piled on more than 9,000 customers net, up from just over 3,000 the previous quarter. \nBoth Nationwide and TSB have current accounts paying 5% interest. \nThe switching figures are provided on a voluntary basis by banks and building societies. The figures cover people, small businesses and small charities using the current account switching service - which has cut the length of time it takes to switch to seven working days, from up to 30 previously and automatically moves outgoing and income payments over to the new account. \nThe figures do not cover customers who switched without using the service, perhaps because they kept their old account open and moved their payments over themselves to their new account. \nBarclays, Bank of Scotland, the Co-operative, HSBC, Lloyds Bank, NatWest and RBS all made net customer losses in the fourth quarter of 2015. Barclays had the biggest net loss of the providers included, with a net fall of over 27,000 customers. \nA Barclays spokeswoman said: \nThe switching service works well for customers, however there is still significant account opening and closing outside of the service. In fact, we continue to open more current accounts each month than we close. 9.04 Coreena Ford Santander on the account fee . . . \nA spokeswoman for Santander said \nThe Santander 123 current account remains one of the most rewarding accounts on the market due to its twin benefits of cashback on household bills and in-credit interest. \nThat, coupled with high levels of customer service, has made our account popular with savvy switchers. \nWe continue to be at the forefront of current account innovation, and just this week, we have added a new account to our range, the 123 Lite current account which offers customers all the cashback benefits of the 123 current account for just £1 per month. 9.02 Coreena Ford Santander pays price for current account fee hike \nThe number of customers flocking to Santander using the current account switching service shrank back sharply after it announced fee hikes for its flagship 123 account, figures show. \nThe data also suggests that Halifax, Nationwide Building Society and TSB have gained ground in the battle to win current account customers’ business. Santander made a net gain of 3,592 customers using the current account switching service between October 1 and December 31 2015, according to data released by payments body Bacs. \nWhile this was still an overall gain - at a time when many other major providers were making net customer losses - it marks a much smaller increase compared with the previous quarter - when Santander made a net gain of 51,000 customers between July 1 and September 30 2015. \nSantander has been considered one of the biggest “winners” of the industry’s current account switching service, which was launched in 2013 to make it easier for customers to ditch their old provider and switch to a new deal. \nSantander’s innovative 123 current account pays cashback on household bills as well as 3% interest. But in January 2016, Santander increased the fee on its 123 account, from £2 to £5 a month. \nWhile the fee hike did not come into force until 2016, plans for the increase were confirmed in September 2015. \nSantander has also just unveiled a new account called 123 Lite. The account pays also up to 3% cashback on household bills and has a smaller monthly fee of just £1 - although unlike the 123 current account it does not pay in-credit interest. Santander Bank signage above a branch, as figures show that the number of customers flocking to Santander using the current account switching service shrank back sharply after it announced fee hikes for its flagship 123 account. 8.54 Coreena Ford LoveTideWater bottling success \nA County Durham premium bottled water company is hoping to bottle success and grow internationally after launching on the back of a five-figure investment. \nThe Darlington-based LoveTideWater secured initial funding via the Finance for Business £10.5m North East Angel Fund, operated by Rivers Capital Partners. \nThis supported a first production run of 330ml and 750ml glass bottles, while helping it build its brand through market research, marketing and design work. \nNow, the business - a supplier to the Brasserie at Rockcliffe Hall, The County at Aycliffe Village and other upmarket restaurants in the region - is working to secure a second tranche of funding, allowing it enter into national and international markets while expanding its product range through adding fruit concentrates and vitamins. \nFind out all about them through the story by my biz desk colleague Robert Gibson here . LoveTideWater founder Valerie Colling 8.45 Coreena Ford More awards for fledgling Sunderland distillery \nWarm congrats this morning to Poetic License Independent Small Batch Distillery, which has won yet more awards less than a year after launching its first drinks. \nThe distillery, which is based within the Best Western Roker Hotel, Sunderland, has been awarded Gin Masters for both its Northern Dry Gin and Old Tom Gin at the International Gin Masters. \nIts new limited edition Strawberries and Cream Picnic Gin also won a Gold Award in the category. \nThe prestigious awards are held annually by The Spirits Business Magazine and is one of the greatest achievements in the gin world. Gins from across the globe are judged by a panel of experts in a blind tasting– the top accolade being Gin Master, followed by Gold, Silver and Bronze awards. \nLuke Smith, head distiller at Poetic License is particular pleased. \nHe joined the firm as an apprentice, but got director and founder Mark Hird interested in gin after taking in a sample he made himself, on his mum’s stove! \nHe said: “To be awarded Gin Masters for both of our core products less than a year after launching is pretty astounding. People work for years to be awarded these sorts of things, so to have achieved it within just 10 months of operating, we’re over the moon to say the least.” Luke Smith, head distiller at Poetic License 8.36 Coreena Ford Microsoft - any sign of a Windows Mobile Smartphone? \nNot yet... \nThe latest results revealed the company’s phone business revenue had declined by 70%, with no new Windows Mobile smartphone yet in sight. \nHowever, the company’s tablet and hybrid laptop business was up 9% on the previous quarter, as the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book continue to sell well. Xbox Live, Microsoft’s online subscription service for its Xbox 360 and Xbox One video games consoles, also reported a 33% increase in monthly active users over the last year, reaching 49 million. 8.33 Coreena Ford Microsoft's revenues rise as cloud and Office products rise 19% - beating analysts predictions \nMicrosoft beat industry expectations by reporting revenue of more than 22.6 billion US dollars (£17.25bn) for the fourth quarter of its 2016 financial year as the technology firm’s cloud services continue to be popular with businesses and consumers. \nAnalysts had expected revenue to be around 22.1 billion dollars (£16.8bn), close to the figure for the same period last year, but a 19% rise in the company’s Office products and cloud services for consumers - which includes familiar software such as Microsoft Word - enabled it to report better-than-expected results. \nMicrosoft also revealed that Office 365 subscriptions had risen to 23.1 million. \nChief executive Satya Nadella said: \nThis past year was pivotal in both our own transformation and in partnering with our customers who are navigating their own digital transformations. \nThe Microsoft Cloud is seeing significant customer momentum and we’re well positioned to reach new opportunities in the year ahead. \nThe latest results continue a trend of refocusing Microsoft’s efforts on its services rather than hardware such as smartphones, a trend introduction when Mr Nadella became chief executive in 2014. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella 8.25 Coreena Ford TalkTalk - any impact on TV subscribers? The BT Sport channels could provide a boost . . . \nTalkTalk saw pre-tax profits more than halve to £14 million in the 12 months to the end of March, as it took a £42 million hit from the cyber attack. \nThe group offered customers a free upgrade to help soothe concerns after the data breach and created a new bundle of online and telephone security features to boost customer protection. \nThe TalkTalk attack was branded a “car crash” earlier this year by information commissioner Christopher Graham, who said it should send a warning shot to the industry. \nIts latest trading update showed TV customers continued to drop, down 23,000 at the end of its first quarter. \nIt is hoping to see TV subscriber numbers recover after recently announcing a deal to offer BT Sport channels from June, while customers can also now sign up and pay for Netflix on their TalkTalk bill. It said its trial to offer direct fibre optic broadband access in York was making “good progress”, with nearly 11,000 homes connected. The group added that nearly half of connections under the trial are new customers. TalkTalk logo 8.23 Coreena Ford TalkTalk stems customer exodus \nA national tale now - and an update from telecoms group TalkTalk, which says its broadband customer base remains 9,000 lower despite halting the exodus from the firm following last year’s cyber attack. \nThe company said revenues held largely firm, edging 0.4% lower in its first quarter, as it continued to cut costs and grew its corporate business to help offset the impact of the hack last October, which resulted in the personal data of nearly 160,000 people being accessed. \nTalkTalk said it had stemmed the flow of customers quitting the group, with so-called churn remaining close to its all-time low at 1.36% in the three months to the end of June. \nIt added new broadband customers, but at half the pace of the previous three months, at 36,000 on a net basis - those joining less those leaving - while mobile net adds also nearly halved to 48,000. \nIts broadband base was 9,000 lower during the quarter, with on-net revenues falling 2%. \nThe group lost 101,000 subscribers in its third quarter last year and was forced to temporarily shut down its online sales channels in the wake of the cyber attack. \nChief executive Dido Harding insisted the group was “pleased with how the year has begun”. \n“Revenue growth was level year on year despite a smaller customer base and churn was down year on year,” she said. \nTalkTalk has already warned that revenues will remain under pressure over the first half of its financial year, but expects to return to growth in the final six months and is sticking by forecasts for underlying annual earnings to grow to between £320 million and £360 million. Dido Harding, chief executive of TalkTalk 8.19 Coreena Ford FTSE opening and Pound latest \nThe FTSE-100 index opened at 6697.37. \nThe pound at 8am was 1.3096 dollars compared to 1.3125 dollars at the previous close. The euro at 8am was 0.8401 pounds compared to 0.8385 pounds at the previous close. 8.15 Coreena Ford Vertu chairman Peter Jones on Brexit vote \nPeter Jones will talk about Brexit at the AGM - and at this point in time the board believes manufacturers will want to support UK retailers, as they have a clear vital interest in maintaining free trade. \nThis is what Mr Jones will say later today: \nOn 23 June 2016, the UK voted to exit the European Union (EU). This has led to some uncertainty for the economy and the motor retail industry in a number of areas. \nRegulations surrounding Manufacturer Franchise contracts are currently determined on an EU basis by Manufacturers and reflect EU competition policy. \nThe Board, at this stage, does not anticipate any major changes to the franchise contract position under which the Group transacts with our Manufacturer partners resulting from the UK leaving the EU. \nThe UK represents the second biggest market for new vehicles in the current EU and thousands of continental European jobs are reliant on a continuation of this trade with the UK. \nConsequently, the Board believes that Manufacturer partners are likely to be keen to support UK retailers through any period of uncertainty. \nThe majority of the Group’s new vehicle sales are imported to the UK from the EU. \nOur Manufacturer partners clearly have a vital interest in ensuring continued free trade access to the key UK market and the Board will be monitoring the negotiations of the trade relations between the EU and UK. \nThe £:€ exchange rate is important to Manufacturer profitability on the UK sales and is a factor in determining the level of supply push of vehicles into the UK market. \nWhilst sterling has declined against the Euro following the referendum result, it remains at levels above the lows seen in 2008/9, and more recently throughout much of 2013, and at levels which the Board believes remain attractive for European Manufacturers to export vehicles to the UK. This should help to underpin the UK new car market which is currently at record levels. \nIt is possible business and consumer confidence in the UK may also come under some pressure as a consequence of the uncertainty in the next few months. \nIn line with trends in recent months, since the referendum new retail vehicle sales volumes have been behind last year. \nHowever, the important revenue streams of used cars and aftersales have not seen any negative impact to date. Peter Jones, chairman of Vertu Motors 8.08 Coreena Ford Top story - Strong aftersales and used vehicle performance drives profitability at Vertu Motors \nVertu Motors, the Gateshead based motor retailer, holds its AGM later today, where the directors will update shareholders on the trading period for the four months to June 30 2016 - and the firm’s in a strong position. \nIn a nutshell, profitability is ahead of the prior year and in line with the Board’s expectations. \nTotal revenues rose by by 21.5% with like-for-like revenues increasing by 8.4%, Group and like-for-like gross margins improved due to higher used car and service margins. \nThe aftersales operations continued to grow strongly with service revenues up 25.6% in the four month period, an increase of 6.1% on a like-for-like basis. \nThe majority of the £35m raised in the placing has also now been put into acquisitions, taking the portfolio to 132 outlets, predominantly under the Bristol Street Motors, Vertu, Farnell, South Hereford Garages, and Macklin Motors brand names. \nGiven the performance of the Group to date and the ongoing integration and improvement of businesses acquired in recent periods, the Board expects the performance for the full year to be in line with current market expectations 8.00 Coreena Ford Good morning... \nMorning all and welcome to Wednesday’s blog and a smattering of news from the stock market, leading with the motor retailer Vertu’s AGM which is due to take place later on today. \nI’m also planning to bring you some national and international news - starting with Microsoft who have been doing rather well on the back of their cloud services division. \nVertu has issued the statement that chairman Peter Jones will read out at the meeting, which looks in detail at how the firm feels it will be affected by the EU referendum result, if at all. \nI’ll give you a reminder of some of our top stories and features we have running today, as well as take a look at what we might be covering here on the business desk later today. \nI’m going to be here until around 9.30am - and if yesterday was anything to go by expect one or two breaking business stories to pop up along the way! \nIf you’d like to contribute to the live blog, tweet at @jnlbusiness to share your stories, opinions and images. \nAlternatively you can drop me a line at coreena.ford@ncjmedia.co.uk but the best way to catch my attention for the next hour or so is through Twitter, so tweet me at @Scoopford", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-20T09:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-20T12:33:35.631+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
