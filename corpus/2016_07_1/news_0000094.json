I am sure most people will understand if I say that after Brexit, the vote of (no) confidence in Jeremy Corbyn and the start of the Tory leadership campaign, I was quite desperate for the peace, tranquillity and reflection of such an important and historic battlefield. \nSome accused me of running away! In reality The Northumberland Fusiliers Battlefields Tour was organised over a year ago to commemorate the one hundredth anniversary of the first day of the Somme when thousands of Tynesiders died. \nAs a member of the Franco-British Council I helped identify the right French contacts for the civil and military permissions required. Though I knew it was the weekend after the EU referendum I didn’t think it would be the weekend after Brexit. \nSo that is why the first time I used my European Union passport after Britain voted to leave the EU was to join 150 veterans, cadets, reservists and their families and supporters en route to the village of La Boisselle in the Somme, via the great battlefields around Ypres in Belgium.

I have always loved the Response memorial in the Civic Centre and as a child the knowledge that my father was in the Armed Services in the Biafran War made the sight of families waving men off to war very personal. \nAnd it was an incredibly moving visit. At La Boisselle on July 1 1916 4,000 men of the Northumberland Fusiliers Tyneside Irish and Tyneside Scottish Battalions died, most before midday, in an attempt to destroy enemy artillery. \nTheir sacrifice is commemorated by La Boisselle Tyneside Memorial Seat and at 7.28 on the Friday, 100 years to the minute from when the order to ‘go over the top’ was given, we assembled there to pay our respects. \nLocal people watched in silence as representatives of the Fusiliers, Cadets, Green Howards and civil society, including myself and Ian Mearns, lay wreathes to the sound of Scottish and Northumberland pipes, hymns and a hearty rendition of the Blaydon Races. \nHistorian John Sheen read a moving tribute to the men that died that day. Actually being there for the anniversary bought to life some of the realities of that morning 100 years ago, the lack of cover, the importance of height, the humour of the soldiers –the two shallow valleys South and North of a low rise were called Sausage and Mash respectively. The nearby Tyne Cot cemetery was named by Northumbrian Fusiliers for a disused German barn originally on the site which reminded them of a Tyneside Cottage. \nIt is now the largest Commonwealth War Grave where 11,953 are buried and 34,870 names of unidentified soldiers. Reading just some of those names underlined the horror of war that we fortunately have not had to experience and all the humour in the world cannot efface. \nWe also visited a much smaller commonwealth cemetery in Ypres, but one with strong ties to Newcastle. It is here that the two sons of Sir James Knott were buried. The memorial fund Sir James set up built St James and St Basils in Fenham as well as Knott Hall in Heddon-on- the-Wall. Both Commonwealth War cemeteries were on land gratefully gifted by the Belgians in perpetuity. \nFinally, Fusiliers laid wreathes at the Menin Gate, watched with such respect and appreciation by tourists and local residents alike it brought tears to the eye. \nOf course it was not possible to totally escape Brexit. Some Belgians raised it with us, one of our party was abused in a bar by a local woman when he said he had voted to leave the European Union, as many on the tour appeared to have done. \nI was told the vote had caused divisions within families and the point was made to me that Labour had to show that it understood why so many of our supporters voted as they did. \nI campaigned strongly for Remain, and I believed it was in the best interest of Newcastle, the North East and the country. \nBut my visit to the Somme emphasised to me just how important it is that we all work together to achieve what is best for the North East and the country and Europe, and that inside or outside of the EU, our shared history and sacrifice merits a relationship that is both mutually supportive and constructive. \n• Chi would like to thank Fusiliers Battlefield Tour Organisers and Participants.
