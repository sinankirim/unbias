With Prime Minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne’s delicates on the block if the country voted Brexit, the Labour heartlands, including the North East, voted Leave even though judged rationally, Remain was the better option for them. But taking down your tormentors was just too good a chance to pass up. Lauren Hurley/PA Wire George Osborne resigned from Government as Theresa May begun her Cabinet reshuffle \nNo matter what you think of Corbyn or the Brexiteers, what would politics be without them? Pretty dull, I’d say. \nIf Corbyn’s leadership challenge hadn’t succeeded last September we’d have had a Labour party barely distinguishable from the Tory government. \nAn exaggeration you think? Well, after Ed Miliband stood down Harriet Harman became temporary leader until a new one was elected. \nShe decided last July Labour should abstain - ie not vote - against the government’s welfare bill which included restrictions on in-work benefits, including curbs on child and working tax credits, part of £12bn worth of cuts sought by ministers by 2020. \nHarman took the decision because she thought it would play better with the public - standing up for those at the sharp end of society seemed to come second in her thinking. \nThis is the same Harman who is in charge of Angela Eagle’s campaign to replace Corbyn. Corbyn voted against the government’s welfare bill, Eagle abstained. \nOne thing we learned last week was if Corbyn really is the problem, Eagle definitely isn’t the answer. Former Shadow Cabinet Minister Angela Eagle launches her bid for the Labour leadership \nWhat does she stand for? Her laughably bad campaign launch looked like she was flogging a perfume called ‘Angela’ rather than an alternative political view. \nAnd as for her excruciating: ‘BBC! Robert Peston!! Cooee!!!’ - it was a political tumbleweed moment she’ll never live down. \nMeanwhile Brexit has done for the Chuckle brothers, Cameron and Osborne. For the life of me I still don’t know what Cameron stands for either, other than winning at all costs. Read More \nAs for Osborne, he tweeted: “Others will judge - I hope I’ve left the economy in a better state than I found it.” \nThey have and he hasn’t. \nOn Thursday a poll came out revealing crisis-ridden Labour was just one point behind the Tories, 35 to 36. Game on and I can’t wait for the next round.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-17T10:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-17T10:50:34.651+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
