Conservative Margaret Thatcher led the country between 1979 and 1990. \nMrs May has the backing of Guy Opperman , the Conservative MP for Hexham, and has now won the support of Mrs Trevelyan, MP for Berwick. \nMrs Trevelyan said: “Not enough of my colleagues chose to lend Michael their support, and now the Conservative Party membership will choose between Energy Minister Andrea Leadsom and Home Secretary Theresa May. My vote in that contest carries no more weight than other members, but I want to be open about who I shall now lend my support to. After deep consideration, I have decided to support Theresa May.” \nShe said the most important issue facing the nation at the moment is the process of leaving the European Union , following the Brexit referendum. Conservative MP for Berwick Anne-Marie Trevelyan \nMrs Trevelyan was a vocal campaigner in favour of leaving the EU. \nShe said: “I am pleased that all my colleagues in the leadership contest – whichever side they campaigned on – are fully committed to negotiating our departure from the EU and building new trading relationships with the rest of the world. \n“This will not be a short nor an easy process, and to try to pretend otherwise is irresponsible. We have over forty years of legislation and regulation from which to extricate ourselves, and replicate should we choose to, and an exit deal to negotiate which is favourable to the UK and all her citizens. This is incredibly important to me as a leave campaigner, so it’s great that we are all Brexiters now.” \nShe added: “Brexit is only the beginning. We need someone capable of running the country alongside the Brexit negotiations, and continuing to push forward the manifesto commitments I and every other Conservative MP was elected on. \n“I believe Theresa is best placed as the woman with the greatest experience of Government and how to make it work for the people, a strong principled and determined personality, and the intellect to steer us through this important challenge, and to compile the most talented team to lead the negotiations.” \nAround 150,000 Conservative members will decide the identity of the party’s new leader - who will also take the keys to Number 10 - with the result to be announced on September 9. \nMrs May claimed a decisive win in the ballot of Conservative MPs, receiving 199 votes - well over half of the 330 Tory MPs - while Mrs Leadsom won the backing of 84 MPs and Mr Gove just 46. \nHer campaign received a boost with an endorsement from The Sun newspaper - which proclaimed on its front page that the “new Mrs T must be Tezza not Leadsom”. \nShe also won the support of Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, who had previously backed Michael Gove, and the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Ruth Davidson. \nBut Ms Davidson called for Mrs May to guarantee that European Union migrants in the UK should be allowed to remain after Brexit. \n“She says that she wants to be able to guarantee them and see guarantees for Brits living abroad in the EU. I actually want her to do one without the other,” Ms Davidson told BBC Two’s Newsnight. \nFollowing the bruising EU referendum campaign and the resignation of David Cameron, the Home Secretary has insisted she can unite the party. \nMrs Leadsom was a prominent Brexit-backer and hopes that her support for leaving the EU will win her votes from Eurosceptics in the Tory grassroots.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-08T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-08T21:03:39.327+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
