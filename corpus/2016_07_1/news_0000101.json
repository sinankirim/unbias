More than 61% of voters in Sunderland backed Brexit in last month’s referendum . \nHe accused the Conservative government of failing to reduce the wealth gap between the north and the south of England, saying: “The UK has the worst regional inequalities of any current member of the European Union.” \nAnd Mr McDonnell claimed the wealth gap would increase unless the Government took action, because regions such as the North East would be hit hardest by leaving the EU . \nHe said: “The North-East exports more goods to the EU than any other English region, per head of population. \n“It also receives more EU structural funding support than any other English region. \n“The Government needs to tell us, now, what it’s going to do to stop North East’s trade relationships being damaged by Brexit. \n“And Government must act to safeguard the £10billion of EU regional funding that is now at risk of being lost. \n“Either it should ensure funding remains in place, or it must guarantee the funding itself.” \nBut the North East also had “huge potential” if the Government was willing to invest in infrastructure, he said. \nLabour would set up a National Investment Bank and a network of regional banks designed to “mobilise £500 billion into the economy and transform Britain, he said. \nThe aim would be to encourage private sector investment by mitigating the risks and giving a firm, government-backed commitment to funding. \n“A ‘Bank of the North’ could help unlock the potential of the North of England, delivering finance for critical local infrastructure and supporting lending to high-potential local businesses. \n“It would mean starting to deliver on the promise of high-quality jobs.” \nHe added: “We should be aiming to create 100,000 additional well-paid, secure jobs across the North-East.” \nIt comes after Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn highlighted what he said was lack of investment in the North East earlier this month. \nSpeaking in the House of Commons, Mr Corbyn said just 50p in every £100 of investment goes to the region. \nThe Government has announced plans for a series of infrastructure upgrades in the north, including dualling the A1 between Newcastle and Scotland, upgrading the A69 and the A6, creating a trans-Penning road tunnel and building a high speed rail line linking the north east and north west. With the exception of the A1 work, however, these schemes are at a very early stage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-18T18:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-18T19:04:08.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
