The Petitions Committee would like to make clear that, in scheduling this debate, they are not supporting the call for a second referendum,\" a spokesman said. \n\"A debate in Westminster Hall does not have the power to change the law, and won't end with the House of Commons deciding whether or not to have a second referendum . \n\"Moreover, the petition - which was opened on May 25, well before the referendum - calls for the referendum rules to be changed. It is now too late for the rules to be changed retrospectively. \n\"It will be up to the Government to decide whether it wants to start the process of agreeing a new law for a second referendum.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-12T19:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-12T20:50:09.546+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
