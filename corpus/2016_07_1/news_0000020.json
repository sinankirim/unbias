It currently lies over 98,000. \nBoth Blyth Valley and South Shields constituencies, however, fall far below Lincolnshire’s Louth and Horncastle which has provided more than 300 signatures, equal to around one in every 312 people.

Once initiated there is a period of two years to negotiate the exit, unless the European Council wishes to extend it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-16T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-16T20:40:09.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
