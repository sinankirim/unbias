That is the last time we have had temperatures this high. \n\"Today was certainly the hottest day of this year without a doubt.\" \nHe added that tomorrow will still be hot, with temperatures about 29C, with showers developing later on. \n\"From tomorrow afternoon through to Thursday morning there will be thunderstorms which will clear the atmosphere. \n\"Temperatures by Friday will be 21C, back to normal. 20C to 21C is normal for this time of year. \n\"Then I can't see any other really hot weather for a fortnight.\" \nSome businesses in the city and county including ice cream sellers and Leicestershire's only outdoor swimming pool were doing a booming trade. \nThe outdoor pool at Hood Park Leisure Centre, in Ashby, was at full capacity. \nDuncan Gibb, commercial manager for Hermitage and Hood Park Leisure Centres, said: \"It's extremely hot and the pool was very busy to the point we were full to capacity on three occasions today. \n\"This is the first time in two years we have been full. \n\"More than 300 people have been through the door.\" \nA barbeque and music added to the party atmosphere. \nRead more: Brexit risk row over Â£35m regeneration of Leicester's rundown of Waterside area \nHe added: \"Because the pool has a wall around it, I always say on a day like today, you really could be abroad - you can't recognise you are in Ashby. \n\"The atmosphere is fantastic. There is an awful lot of joyful banter and parents seem to be happy to top up their sun tan.\" \nDaniele Taverna, co-founder of Gelato Village, in St Martin's Square, Leicester, said sales were up roughly 30 per cent. \nHe said: \"Many more people are around and the product we sell is refreshing - it does increase sales.\" \nKieron Parker, who works for Steve's Ices, was in selling ice cream in Leicester. \nHe said it was like a greenhouse working in the ice cream van as it is made of plastic and refrigerators were letting off heat. \n\"It is much hotter in here than outside.\" \nHe said sales were up by about one third today. \nVolunteer steam train driver Bill Brazier, 76, had to brave temperatures nudging 40C as he shovelled coal into a steam loco. \nToday he worked from 6.30am to 4.30pm making three trips from Loughborough to Leicester North station and back on the Great Central Railway. \nHe took it in turns with the fireman, Bob Littler, to shovel coal into the furnace. \nHe said with the temperature about 30C outside, where he was working in the engine it would have been closer to 40C. \nBill said: \"You could not get much hotter than what I was doing. \n\"It has been ridiculously hot. It's almost unbearable temperatures like this, but of course, the old guys used to do it years ago.\" \nHe said he just wanted to get home and get into the bath. \n\"I found it very tiring - I am absolutely whacked. It is hard and physical, but I enjoy doing it. \n\"In the winter, it is lovely because you're next to a really hot fire.\" \nBill volunteers two to three times a week on the trains.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-19T20:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-20T00:52:21.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
