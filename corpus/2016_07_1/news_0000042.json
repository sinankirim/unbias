It was all a front and was never properly funded, it will be one of these things that slowly fade away. \n“In principle I am a big believer in devolution but this was never that. It was unfair and was the devolution of responsibility, not finances. It would lead to government blaming our councils when things fell apart. If I am wrong and it does resurface I hope we do it properly. \n“We in the North East know what is best for our region, we know best what our desires, needs and beliefs are. If devolution is only done half-hearted then it is never going to succeed.” \nNick Brown, MP for Newcastle East, said: “If this is the end of the Northern Powerhouse then I say good riddance. \n“What is needed is regional economic development enthusiastically championed by central Government. What the Northern Powerhouse offers is minor local Government reform.” Read More There is a new Northern Powerhouse minister - so what happens next? \nThe North East Combined Authority has already put the region’s devolution deal on hold following Britain’s vote to leave the European Union. \nLeaders of the region’s seven councils chose to freeze discussions over devolution for the North East earlier this month pending further assurances over funding in the aftermath of Brexit. \nThe agreement guarantees £30m a year for the region to spend – in addition to being given control of a £3.4bn pool of investment cash. \nThe North East would also get new powers covering employment and skills, transport and planning and business activity – all intended to drive economic growth. \nNew minister Mr Percy said: “I’ve always championed our area as a backbencher and now I get to champion the North within government.” \nA Government spokesman said: “The Northern Powerhouse will continue to be a priority and Andrew Percy has been appointed Northern Powerhouse Minister. \n“The Government is making huge strides in rebalancing the economy - foreign direct investment has increased by 127% in the two years since the Northern Powerhouse was established.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-17T19:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-17T19:59:49.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
