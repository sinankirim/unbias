However, it looks like there’s worse to come, possibly much worse. \n“The reality of the UK leaving the EU and the associated heightened uncertainty, especially in relation to commercial property and housing investment, is therefore likely to cause further stress in coming months.” \nCommercial property is bearing the brunt of Brexit fallout as investors scramble to cash out following the Brexit vote. \nLast week, Henderson Global Investors, Canada Life and Threadneedle joined M&G Investments, Aviva and Standard Life Investments in halting trading in their property funds. \nOn Wednesday, Aberdeen Asset Management lifted a week-long suspension from trading in its property fund.
