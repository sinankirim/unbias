Here's what you can expect \nBut referring to David Cameron , the outgoing Prime Minister, he added: “The Prime Minister has already said that Parliament will have a role, and it is clearly right that a decision as momentous as this one must be fully debated and discussed in Parliament \n“Clearly, the precise format and timing of those debates and discussions will need to be agreed... I strongly doubt that they will be confined to a single debate or a single occasion.” Tens of thousands of people march through central London in a 'March For Europe Event' \nMrs Goodman said making a decision without a vote in the Commons would take power away from the public when the Leave campaign had promised to give power back. \nShe said: “If the royal prerogative is used to trigger Article 50, would that not be a clear breach of the promises made to the public by the Brexiters during the referendum campaign that they would ‘take back control’ and ‘restore parliamentary sovereignty’? \n“How could it be right to initiate negotiations with important and far-reaching significance for citizenship rights, immigration rules, employment and social rights, agriculture, trading relations with the EU and third countries, and Scotland and Northern Ireland, without seeking Parliament’s approval for the aims, objectives and red lines?” \nShe added: “The issues at stake are the culmination of 40 years of legislation. Is it not extraordinary to suggest that changes to these areas should not now come back to this House?” \nChi Onwurah , Labour MP for Newcastle Central, backed calls for a vote in Parliament, saying: “Brexit means Brexit, but there is no agreed definition of what ‘Brexit’ means, apart from the fact that it involves parliamentary sovereignty. \n“Is the Minister seriously proposing that we should undergo such a momentous seismic change as Brexit without its having been defined to the British people before the referendum, or decided on by Parliament after it?” More on the EU Referendum", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-12T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-12T17:46:49.100+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
