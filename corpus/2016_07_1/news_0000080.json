A reading above 50 indicates growth. \nThe sharp contraction was driven by a “steep decline” in house building and the first fall in commercial construction work since May 2013. \nIt also revealed the sharpest drop in new business volumes since December 2012 amid mounting uncertainty surrounding Britain’s vote on the European Union. \nThe referendum result prompted massive drops in the share values of North housebuilders Bellway, Barratt and Persimmon, and though they have made some recovery are all well below their pre-referendum results. \nTim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said the speed of the downturn in the days leading up to the Brexit vote provided “a clear warning flag for the wider post-Brexit economic outlook”. \nHe said: “Widespread delays to investment decisions and housing market jitters saw the UK construction sector experience its worst month for seven years in June. \n“Construction firms are at the sharp end of domestic economic uncertainty and jolts to investor sentiment, so trading conditions were always going to be challenging in the run-up to the EU referendum.” \nHe added: “The vast majority of June’s survey responses were received ahead of the EU referendum, so the worry is that the ensuing political turmoil will hit construction spending decisions for some time to come. \n“As a result, the latest figures raise the likelihood that the Bank of England will inject additional stimulus this summer in an attempt to dampen the short-term impact of Brexit uncertainty on the real economy.” \nThe survey found that firms had reacted to the slowdown in demand by trimming input buying and recruitment, with employment rising at one of its weakest rates since 2013 in June. \nBut while the industry slumped back to levels last seen in 2009, the rate of contraction was still “much slower” than during the last economic downturn. \nDavid Noble, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS), said ambiguity and indecision triggered by the referendum had “flung the industry into unknown territory”. \nHe said: “Gloom and fragility descended on the sector with the steepest drop in new orders since December 2012. \n“Caused by the continuing insecurities in both the global and UK economies and the hesitancy shown by clients to commit to projects before the EU referendum, overall activity was at its frailest for seven years.” \nHe added: “The only glimmer of light through the brickwork is the rate of decline was not as sharp as that experienced during the last recession. \n“But, with business confidence at a three-year low, and purchasing activity at its lowest level for six-and-a-half years, this is likely to offer little comfort.” \nHoward Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHS Economics, said: “Additionally, construction companies’ input costs could well be pushed markedly higher by a sharply weakened pound. A substantial amount of building components and materials are imported.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-04T16:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-04T17:20:36.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
