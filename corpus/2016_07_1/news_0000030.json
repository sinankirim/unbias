Cllr David Faulkner 'EDL not welcome here' Northumbria's police commissioner condemns hate crime \nHe said: “Brexit has helped in the minds of people inimical to the cause of diversity and tolerance, it has helped normalise the views of those who do not agree with multiculturalism.” \nCoun Faulkner’s motion to full council, which was agreed, stated: “Council deplores the hostile and misleading anti-immigration narrative that the Leave side of the EU referendum campaign propagated and the way in which it has poisoned political discourse. \n“Council believes that the damage to community relations will be lasting and the encouragement to the far right a serious concern. \n“Newcastle is both a City of Sanctuary which welcomes asylum-seekers and refugees, and is a city in need of the skills that migrant labour bring.” \nNine racist crimes were recorded by Northumbria Police in the days that followed the Brexit vote.
