sell its strengths; improve transport links; encourage expansions of existing projects as well as new investments; and think globally. \nEY’s senior partner in Yorkshire and the North East, Stuart Watson, said: “The US was the leading individual source of FDI in the region in 2015, but the majority of FDI projects in the North of England actually came from Europe. \n“With Brexit on the horizon, these relationships will need to be bolstered.” \nSimon Allport, senior partner in the North West, added: “Outside of Europe, new investment in 2015 was secured from India and Japan but less so from China or other locations. \n“We can do this better if we work together, showcasing the assets and skills available not just in one region but across the North. \n“In May next year, elections will take place across the country for nine new mayors, five of them in the North of England, from Liverpool across to the Tees Valley. \n“It is imperative that these metro mayors act as global ambassadors for each of their regions on the global stage. The new mayors must also work closely with each other to encourage investment into the North as a whole.” \nEY is a global leader in assurance, tax, transaction and advisory services. \nThe research, conducted for the company by the CSA Institute between February and April 2016, involved telephone interviews with a representative group of 1,469 international decision makers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-07-27T02:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-07-27T03:54:36.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
