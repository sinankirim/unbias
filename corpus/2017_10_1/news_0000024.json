In practice, it means businesses would do less work and employ fewer people. \nSunderland’s economy would shrink by £1.44bn, and Gateshead would lose £1.09bn.

This is precisely why the Liberal Democrats, alone among political parties, are campaigning for an exit from Brexit by offering the people a vote on the final deal.

Until they do, these are the most authoritative figures available.” \nInternational Trade Secretary Liam Fox insisted the UK would press ahead with a “no-deal” Brexit if need be, when he spoke on ITV’s Peston show on Sunday. \nIt would mean the UK traded with the EU using rules set out by the World Trade Organisation (WTO). There would be tariffs on goods exported between the EU and UK, and delays at borders as customs checks took place. \nMr Fox said: “If we have no deal and we trade on current WTO terms, that’s the basis not only that Britain trades with countries like the United States, but that the EU trades with the rest of the world in most circumstances.

This could include vetoing plans to leave without a deal. \nHowever, it’s unclear what would happen if Parliament did reject the Government’s Brexit plans. \nThe UK has already told the EU it is leaving by March 2019 and it’s unclear whether that process would automatically stop if Parliament votes for a pause.
