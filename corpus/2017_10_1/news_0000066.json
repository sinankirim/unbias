Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThe Treasury has analysed the effect of Brexit on the North East but won’t release the results, Chancellor Philip Hammond has revealed. \nHe said experts had produced models showing how different regions would be affected when the UK leaves the European Union. \nBut the findings will not be published because they are commercially sensitive, he said. \nMr Hammond was quizzed by Newcastle North MP Catherine McKinnell , a member of the House of Commons Treasury Committee. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond (Image: Getty Images Europe) \nHe told her the Treasury was “constantly using” a model it had developed to look at how regions would be affected by Brexit, as well as how different sectors of the economy would benefit or suffer. \nShe told him: “You must understand there is a public interest in seeing these assessments and understanding the implications of them.” \nBusiness leaders in the North East have expressed concern in the past about the effect of leaving the EU without a trade deal, given the importance of exports to the region’s economy, and the potential difficulty some firms could face recruiting staff when freedom of movement comes to an end. \nManagers at carmaker Nissan have said it’s essential to ensure items such as car parts can be transported quickly between the UK and EU. Catherine McKinnell (Image: Newcastle Chronicle) \nMs McKinnell said: “We at least now know the Government is measuring the potential effects of leaving the EU on different parts of the country. \n“It’s frustrating they’re not prepared to actually share any of these assessments, nor indeed explain how they are going to support those regions that will be most affected by Brexit.
