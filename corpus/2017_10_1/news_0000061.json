Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThe medieval Great Hall at Dartington is a fitting setting for a Hallowe’en horror story, and Sir Vince Cable with his saturnine features has a similar ability to chill the blood. \nCertainly, the chill wind of reality seemed to blow through the Devon and Cornwall Business Council’s annual dinner in the Great Hall last week when the Liberal Democrat leader spoke. \nAs Business Secretary in the 2010-15 government, Sir Vince is not casually scaremongering when he warns of tough times ahead. \nOur economic system had a major heart attack in 2008. We’re out of intensive care, but still hooked up to an IV line. The IV line carries cheap money, of course, and not a medical saline solution. Low interest rates and devaluation have pumped financial liquidity into the economy.

We’re racking up debt partly because of low wages, which in turn are linked to pathetic productivity that has flatlined for a decade.Few would be surprised to learn that productivity is higher in Germany and the United States. But France, and even Italy, easily outstrip us too. \nCornwall’s productivity is 30% below the UK average, so is it any wonder that wages are low and poverty high?

And just as boards were beginning to loosen the purse strings, along came Brexit, fangs bared and cloak flapping in the moonlight, to suck the blood out of the economy. \nVampire movies end well, don’t they. And Sir Vince had a wake-up message for the Westcountry: pull together. \nWe all know how it goes. Plymouth hates Exeter and vice versa, and Cornwall wishes the Tamar would crack apart and do a proper job of cutting them off. \nMeanwhile, Somerset pretends it is a kind of Greater Bristol with no connections to the country bumpkins to the west. \nWe all hate politicians and civil servants in London, who ignore us. Government money is being doled out for regional development, but most of it is going to the “Midland Engine” and the “Northern Powerhouse”, to London and the South East. Read More \nWhitehall has “a bit of a blurred image” of the Westcountry, Sir Vince says. “It’s very much up to you to organise yourselves.” \nBirmingham, Coventry and Wolverhampton have done it, burying their differences and pulling together under an elected mayor. \n“I didn’t use to be in favour of these mayors,” he says. “But they do work” – even in rural areas such as Cambridgeshire. \nWe can understand why politicians wave their strings of garlic at the terrifying, power-sapping idea. But if they really care about this region’s people, perhaps it is time to think again.
