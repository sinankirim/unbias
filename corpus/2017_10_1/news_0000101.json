They tended to be foreign investors who had the benefit of the currency. \n“It is a bit like buying used cars. If you overpay for a used car it is quite hard to sell it, and if you overpay for an acquisition it is quite hard to make money on it. So we have to be buying things at the right price. We are very focused on that. \n“It wasn’t that we were not looking for acquisitions, it was that we either felt that the price was too high or that the opportunity would be cheaper in the next 18 months.” \nMr Forrester added that he expected the firm would make its next acquisition in the next 12 months, but said currently there was no news to announce. \nOverall Vertu’s turnover remained flat at £1.45bn during the six month perdiod. \nWhile sales of new cars decreased, Vertu’s sales of used cars increased by 1.1% on a like-for-like basis. This was the twelfth consecutive period the firm has seen an increase in its used car sales.

Vehicle repairs and servicing was the main driver in the company’s aftersales operations, with like-for-like revenues growing by 4.4%. \nEarlier this year Vertu revealed it was launching a new apprenticeship scheme that would allow candidates to earn a debt-free degree while earning a £18,000 salary. \nThe first intake of eight apprenticeships have now enrolled on the scheme, which is carried out in conjunction with Northumbria University. \nFollowing the results Vertu has increased its interim dividend by 10% to 0.55p per share.
