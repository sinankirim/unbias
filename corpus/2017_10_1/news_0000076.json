Only continued house building prevented the industry falling into recession. Ben Bradshaw, Exeter MP \nDuncan Brock of the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, which helps compile the regular surveys said: “Reduced Government spending, economic uncertainty and Brexit-delayed decision-making among clients were largely to blame.” Read More EU repeal bill 'biggest power grab since Henry VIII' \nThat will be little comfort to decision-makers in Exeter, who now have to go back to the drawing board. \nThe good news is the fundamentals of Exeter’s economy are strong. We’ve ridden previous down-turns better than most. But we are not immune to what’s happening in the economy as a whole. Ben Bradshaw MP \nBefore the EU Referendum, the UK was the best performing of the major economies. We’re now the worst. This is not “project fear”. It is project fact. It is becoming unsustainable for the hard Brexiteers to continue to pretend the course they have set the country on is not harming us. The Chancellor, Philip Hammond, at least has the honesty to admit there will be “trade-offs” in any Brexit deal and he’s urged his Conservative colleagues to be honest too. He faces an unenviable task in next month’s budget - deteriorating public finances and calls for long overdue investment in our public services – while his own hard Brexiteer MPs want him to spend billions of pounds planning for no deal on Brexit. Read More Ben Bradshaw asks whether it is possible to halt Brexit \nThis can’t go on. Sooner or later the Government must decide whether it wants the kind of Brexit the Chancellor wants – as close to our current trading relationship with the EU as possible to minimise the economic damage – or the fantasy world of Boris Johnson and the hard Brexiteers. \nThere is already no chance that this month’s deadline of moving to the next stage of talks will be met. Mrs May says the ball’s in other 27 EU members’ court. But the 27 have always made clear they need clarity on citizens’ rights, the Irish border and the divorce bill first. Mrs May’s Government has not provided it. Ben Bradshaw, former Culture Secretary \nThere is a real and growing danger that the divisions in Mrs May’s Cabinet mean we are heading for no deal. That would be catastrophic for our already fragile economy. Read More \nMy hope and expectation would be that Parliament would intervene to prevent such a disaster. \nThat’s why the legal advice over the reversibility of Article 50 is so important. Ben Bradshaw \nWhen I and several Labour colleagues asked Mrs May about this in Parliament on Monday, she dodged the question. Read More Ben Bradshaw: Why I have completely changed my mind over Jeremy Corbyn \nI took from that 1. She has received legal advice and 2. It confirms that the Article 50 Process could be stopped. \nThat provides a scintilla of comfort, that, if it came to it, Parliament could save the country from hurtling over a cliff.
