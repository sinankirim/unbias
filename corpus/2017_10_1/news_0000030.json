Some of my nurses are doing tasks they don't need to do, they are cleaning bed spaces and giving out cups of tea, things other people can be trained to do. \n\"It might be that we replace a nurse with a pharmacist or a physio, I don't know yet. It depends on the level of care and the type of wards they are on. \n\"When we know what the boundaries for the nursing associates' scope of practice will be, it may be that on some of our wards, we do say we can have a different ratio of registered nurses.\" \nThe trust said any ideas are still at the \"concept stage\" and would not be brought in without the approval of regulators. \nTrust chief executive John Adler has said Brexit was having an effect on recruitment.

At the peak, we had around 440 EU nurses and only 207 of them remain with us. \n“We currently have around 500 nurse vacancies and we know that we will not be able to fill all those roles. We cannot keep doing what we have always done and need to look at the diversity of roles we need to make up a ward team, such as nursing associate roles. \n“This is not to undermine the need for registered nurses but there just are not enough of them and every trust is finding this a challenge.” \nOn Tuesday Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced a 25 per cent increase in nurse training places to boost numbers of home-grown NHS staff as Britain leaves the EU. \nMr Hunt announced that an extra 5,500 nursing associates will get training on the job to qualify as full registered nurses via a new apprenticeship path. \nThe Department of Health said the moves were designed to \"reduce the reliance on expensive agency nurses and overseas recruits\".

It is not fair on patients or staff alike. The shortage is made even worse as European nurses leave, but few can live with the uncertainty during the negotiations. \n\"The Government must increase the number of qualified nurses and give our European colleagues real assurances, not more meaningless rhetoric.\" Jon ASworth (Image: Rick Byrne) \nLeicester South MP and Labour shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said: \"The shortage of nurses is not limited to Leicester and it is yet another example of the NHS being mismanaged by the Tories. \n\"The management of UHL will be working hard to make sure they have the right mix of staff on the wards, and they are being let down by the Government’s failure to make sure there are enough nurses available to fill the roles that are needed. \n\"The Government must do more. Guaranteeing the rights of EU nationals to remain in the UK after Brexit would help to stop the flood of EU nurses leaving the UK. \n\"It also has to say how it will replace the nurses that will retire from the profession in the near future.” Like us on Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-10-05T20:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-10-06T03:42:35.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
