Daniel Jaines Published: 16:47 Thursday 19 October 2017 \nTwo groups looking to bring communities together met recently as Boston welcomed members of Brixton to the area. \nThe Boston More in Common (BMIC) group, which was set up following the EU Referendum, met with members of the Lambeth More in Common (LMIC) group as well as business and youth leaders from the Brixton area of south London as part of efforts to learn from others about integration. \nThe LMIC group met with the town’s mayor Coun Brian Rush, before touring some of its landmarks and local businesses including the Boston Stump, the Guildhall, Boston Body Hub and the Sam Newsom Centre. \nThe group included 10 young people from the Advocacy Academy, members of the South London Inter Faith group, Faiths Together in Lambeth, Polish and Eritrean Groups, market traders, the Lambeth Business Advisory board, Waterloo Action Centre and others. \nJuliam Thompson, the man behind BMIC told The Standard the event ‘went really well’. \nHe said: “The purpose of the visit was for each group to come over and meet their counterparts, exchange ideas and look at how each other does things \n“It was a strengthening of friendship between Boston and Brixton.” \nIn the referendum, Brixton was the place with the highest number of ‘remainers’ in the UK with 78.6 per cent while Boston was the highest ‘leave’ vote with 75.6 per cent. \nJulian Thompson, along with three others, took up the challenge of forming the group after appearing on the Radio Four Two Rooms show about the Brexit vote. \nBMIC will be looking to visit and tour Brixton next year. \nNews and updates about the Boston More in Common group can be found on its Facebook Page.
