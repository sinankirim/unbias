A Labour Government would immediately introduce an emergency price cap while we transition to a fairer system for bill payers.” Newcastle Central MP, Chi Onwurah (Image: Newcastle Chronicle) \nThe Government has published the Draft Domestic Gas and Electricity (Tariff Cap) Bill, which will be scrutinised by the Commons’ Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Select Committee. It will then need to be approved by Parliament. \nIn the meantime, fuel charges are to be capped for five million households on standard variable tariffs this winter. They include four million with pre-payment meters at home, who tend to be people on the lowest incomes, and a million households which receive the warm home discount, a payment for people on certain benefits. \nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) found that customers of the Big Six energy suppliers on standard variable and default tariffs are paying £1.4bn a year more than they need to.

Big Six companies have been overcharging their most loyal customers for years and years. Read More How will Brexit affect the North East? The Treasury knows but they're not going to tell you \n“The temporary nature of the cap is fine for now but it’s important that the Government is willing to extend the cap and even make it permanent if the Big Six companies don’t mend their ways. The challenge is now for suppliers, and switching sites, to find new ways to prevent British consumers from being ripped off.” \nAlex Neill, Which? managing director of home products and services, said: “For millions of consumers worried about their energy bills, a cap might sound like a positive move.

As it will take some time to come into effect, customers sitting on expensive standard variable tariffs should switch now.” \nCitizens Advice chief executive, Gillian Guy, said: “The runaway costs of default energy tariffs need to be tackled, and this draft Bill is an important step towards an energy market that works better for consumers. \n“We agree with the Government that an absolute cap is a better option than a relative cap, and will help to ensure the market remains competitive so that consumers who shop around can still get a good deal. \n“However, a cap on prices isn’t the end of the story when it comes to fixing the broken energy market, which is why it is vital that Ofgem takes into account the need to protect vulnerable consumers, encourage efficiency, and incentivise switching when it sets the cap. This is particularly important given the temporary nature of the measures.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-10-12T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-10-12T21:03:12.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
