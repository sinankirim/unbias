People are concerned that the process will be complicated and bureaucratic, and will put up hurdles that are difficult to overcome. I want to provide reassurance here too. \n“We are developing a streamlined digital process for those applying for settled status in the UK in the future. This process will be designed with users in mind, and we will engage with them every step of the way.” Like us on Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-10-19T00:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-10-19T02:08:40.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
