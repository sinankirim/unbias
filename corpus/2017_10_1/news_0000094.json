Nearly all the university towns voted to remain.” Tim Iredale looking bemused \nIn Devon, only Exeter and the South Hams voted to remain. \nThe majority of towns in the South West voted for Brexit - in Plymouth the no vote pulling in 59.9 per cent of the electorate compared to 40.1 per cent who voted to stay in the June 2016 referendum. Read More \nIn all, voters in East Devon, Mid Devon, North Devon, Plymouth, Teignbridge, Torbay, Torridge and West Devon voted to leave. \nExeter and the South Hams were the only Devon constituencies which voted to remain: \nExeter REMAIN +10.6% \nSouth Hams REMAIN +5.8% \nMr Sheerman said: “The truth is that when you look at who voted to remain most of them were the better educated people in our country. \n\"You can actually see the pattern. Nearly all the university towns voted to remain.” \nAsked by presenter Tim Iredale if he stood by his remarks, Mr Sheerman was defiant saying: “Absolutely, I think it’s true.” Read More Locked up in Devon in October 2017 \nMr Sheerman, who represents Huddersfield, then took to Twitter to underline his certainty on the issue saying: “Pleased that my comments @BBCLookNorth on link between Brexit support and lower educational attainment has stimulated debate.” \nOne of those to question his reasoning was Michael Taylor who tweeted: “I wonder how many of the people Mr Sheerman is supposed to represent are outraged by his moronic remarks?” \nBut Julie Crocker supported Mr Sheerman saying: “You’re spot on! Brexiteers can’t stand it, of course, but if you’re a bit aware of facts you know Brexit is a terrible, terrible idea!” Read More Police appeal after two men left fighting for their lives in Bideford head-on crash \nAnd his remarks were backed up by Peter Kellner, the former president of the YouGov polling firm, on BBC Radio 4's Today proramme who said that they were factually correct. \n“I would not use Barry Sheerman’s choice of words but the facts are broadly on his side,” Kellner told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Monday. \n“Overall, people who left school at 15 or 16 voted around two to one for Brexit. \n\"[For] people who got up to A-level or equivalent qualification [it was] 50:50. \n\"Graduates voted two to one to remain in the EU. So yes, there is quite a clear educational gradient in the way people voted in last year’s referendum.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-10-30T14:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-10-30T14:07:44.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
