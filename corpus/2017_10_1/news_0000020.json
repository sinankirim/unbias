It's a magnet for bargain-hunters - not everyone can afford John Lewis Share Comments \nLast week I joined my colleague Abbie Bray to cover the opening of the new Poundworld Plus at the top of Fore Street, where British Home Stores used to be. There was a lot of speculation about who was going to go into this prime site following the demise of the national chain. \nThere is a view that Exeter needs to position itself as a prestige retail location. That is a fine ambition, but the scrapping of plans to extend Princesshay at the other end of town must raise a question over just how viable that is, with the prospect of Brexit and jitters over the economy. \nBut shops do come and go, witness the departure of Simply Be and Jacamo on the High Street, the imminent arrival of a Doc Marten store and the move of Lush into Princesshay, to be replaced by surfwear shop Finisterre. Read More Here's what's replacing the old Exeter Lush store \nPoundworld is a budget retailer. And from the queue of around 300 people outside on the opening day, that is exactly what a large number of the shoppers of Exeter want. \nI read recently that the current economic climate means real wages have not gone up for many people in a decade. And those on fixed incomes, such as pensions and benefits, are seeing a fall in their living standards as price rises outstrip any increase in their income. So low-price retailers can offer people on a fixed budget a chance to get out and buy what they need at realistic prices. \nI was surprised at how much snobbery there is in Exeter about pound shops. From some of the comments on our coverage on Facebook, you’d think it was the end of the world that a new budget store has opened. Not everyone wants to, or can afford to, shop in John Lewis. Read More Massive £5 million Hindu temple planned for Exeter \nI shop in pound shops quite regularly, not for everything, but you can find some real bargains. For example, I take a daily 10mg tablet of cetirizine hydrochloride during the summer for my hayfever. I got 14 for £1 from Poundland, whereas chemists were charging more than £5 for the same tablet in a branded box. Thank goodness for the competition from budget shops. If people have got money to throw away, good luck to them, but I suspect most people in Exeter are happy to have another place to bargain-hunting.
