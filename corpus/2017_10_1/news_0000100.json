Trade is cyclical, and no matter what environment we are, there continue to be barriers to trade,” she said. \n“Nobody knows what Brexit means but we do know that market trends and market environments and market economics change on a daily basis. \n“What we have tried to do at Enterprise Ireland is to potentially identify the greatest area of where there will need to be more support for companies going forward,” she explained. 9.05 Coreena Ford Crystal Maze-style business launched by Newcastle father-of-two \nA creative father-of-two has turned a hobby into a Crystal Maze-style business, taking fun and games into buildings and homes around the region. \nJim Gillon is the brains behind Enigma Mobile, a Newcastle company operating across the North East serving up team-based challenge events that can be set up in almost any venue, including businesses, homes and workplaces. \nHe was inspired to create the company after several years of staging successful parties at home, influenced by the popular Channel 4 game show and the rise of experiences like escape rooms, where players are locked in a room and have to escape by solving puzzles and logic problems. \nThe two-man team stages parties for grown-ups and children as well as corporate events. \nMr Gillon, of Heaton, Newcastle said: “Escape rooms are becoming increasingly popular, as folk shun digital tech and screens, going back to real-life experiences for their enjoyment. \nHe first came up with the idea for Enigma Mobile nine years ago. \nHe said: “This all came about years ago when my partner Kirsty was pregnant with our first child and we couldn’t really go out. I’d turn our house into the Crystal Maze and we’d get all of our friends round, and we’d all have a great time.” Jim Gillon who runs a business offering crystal maze style games (Image: Newcastle Chronicle) 9.00 KEY EVENT 'I was homeless at 16 and now I'm a CEO': meet Streetwise's leader Mandy Coppin \nIt is traditional for firms to hold events to celebrate a big anniversary, but not many can say their chief executive led a squadron of planes down the Tyne to mark 25 years in business. \nBut then Mandy Coppin, head of youth charity Streetwise, isn’t your usual chief executive. \nMandy has spent her entire career working in the voluntary and community sector, set up community services that have helped thousands of people and she also happens to be a fully qualified pilot and women’s self-defence instructor. \nAs leader of Streetwise, she heads up a team of 24 people which has provided free, confidential and non-judgmental information and advice support services to more than 300,000 people since 1991. And she is one CEO the 15,000-plus young service users who turn to Streetwise each year can relate to: she was homeless at 16.

Mr Gurr admitted that Amazon has a commercial interest behind bringing companies online, but suggested there were larger benefits. \n“It’s an area we’re passionate about, and some of it is in light of self-interest, but we’re very passionate particularly about helping small and medium sized businesses to succeed and export.” Hadrian's Wall above Cawfield Quarry - Amazon is making a bid for more rural business.

Further updates will be made when appropriate.” \nNorthern & Shell is owned by Richard Desmond, who acquired the titles in 2000 for £125 million, although it is unclear how much a deal would be worth today. \nThe print media industry is grappling with a decline in print advertising and any combination could herald cost savings and a shared cut of a larger advertising pool. 8.45 Coreena Ford Harvey Weinstein sacked by Weinstein Company amid sexual harassment claims \nHarvey Weinstein has been dismissed from the Weinstein Company with immediate effect “in light of new information about misconduct”, the board of directors has announced. \nThe Hollywood studio had launched an inquiry into allegations of sexual harassment concerning the Academy Award-winning producer, who is one of its founders. \nA statement from the Weinstein Company Board of Representatives said: “In light of new information about misconduct by Harvey Weinstein that has emerged in the past few days, the directors of The Weinstein Company - Robert Weinstein, Lance Maerov, Richard Koenigsberg and Tarak Ben Ammar - have determined, and have informed Harvey Weinstein, that his employment with The Weinstein Company is terminated, effective immediately.” \nHarvey Weinstein, who was co-chairman of the studio, had previously announced he was taking leave of absence after claims were made by women with whom he had worked. \nThe departure leaves Weinstein’s brother Bob, a co-chairman, and chief operating officer David Glasser at the helm of the company \nThe money and the power behind some of the biggest Hollywood films of the past 25 years, Weinstein and brother Bob founded Miramax in 1979, building it into a major Hollywood player before selling it to Disney in 1993. \nThey continued to work for the firm until 2005 when they quit to set up the Weinstein Company, which spawned hits including The King’s Speech, Django Unchained and Silver Linings Playbook.
