Could it have been worse? Share   \nTheresa May’s big speech to the Conservative Party conference was supposed to be a fresh start. \nShe admitted the Conservative general election campaign had been a failure, saying: “I am sorry”. \nAnd she set out a series of major new policies, in an attempt to show her government was doing more than just Brexit. \nBut it all went horribly wrong. \nFirst, the speech descended into chaos as a prankster handed her a P45 unemployment notice on stage. \nComedian Lee Nelson - real name Simon Brodkin - joked that Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson had asked him to perform the stunt. \nAmid frantic scenes he was bundled out of the conference hall and through the exhibition stands by security staff at the Manchester Central venue. Comedian Simon Brodkin, also known as Lee Nelson confronts Prime Minister Theresa May during her keynote speech \nHe told reporters: “Boris told me to do it. He’s left me in the lurch.” \nThen, Mrs May repeatedly had to stop talking because she had a series of coughing fits. \nThe audience of Conservative activists broke into applause to try to give her a chance to recover. \nBut it happened again and again. \nAnd then, the carefully-prepared backdrop behind her began to fall apart. \nWhite letters on a blue board spelt out the slogan: “Building A Country That Works For Everyone”. \nBut the “F” fell off - so that it read “A Country That Works Or Everyone”.

But when the moment came to deliver it, things could hardly have gone worse. \nTory MPs rallied round. Hexham Conservative MP Guy Opperman said on Twitter: “Theresa May showed she is tough, resolute, full of duty and passionate for aspiration, free markets and a plan for a better Britain.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-10-04T15:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-10-04T16:19:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
