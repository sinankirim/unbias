The dairy farms surveyed produce over 2.23 billion litres of milk – 15% of the UK’s overall annual volume \nJohn Allen, managing partner of dairy specialists Kite Consulting, who sponsored the survey, said of the findings: “Labour issues have shot to the top of the list of challenges for many dairy farms after the Brexit referendum. \n“Clearly a very significant proportion of our milk is dependent on foreign workers, and over a quarter of farmers say they have significant or intense problems recruiting. It is already one of the key limiting factors to growth, and to the effective operation of dairy farms.” Read More Ollie Allen to retire from Devon County Show role after 21 years at the helm \nHe added: “The ready and steady supply of skilled, dedicated foreign workers is critical to the success of the sector, and to its long-term prosperity.” \nIn the South West, the total of 152 foreign workers formed 13% of the labour employed on the farms surveyed – putting it joint third nationally in terms of reliance. The highest reliance on non-UK workers was in the South East, where foreign workers equated for 22% of staff. The lowest was in the North East and East Midlands, at just 1% and 3% respectively. More than half of non-UK workers were in skilled positions such as herdsmen or herd managers, the survey found (Image: Rob Stothard / Getty Images) \nThe dairy farms surveyed produce over 2.23 billion litres of milk – 15% of the UK’s overall annual volume – and have between them nearly 270,000 cows. While a total of 11% of employees were non-UK nationals (521 from 4,635 total employees including family labour), almost 17% of dairy businesses have foreign workers within their workforce. More than half of these non-UK workers were in skilled positions such as herdsmen or herd managers. \nThe survey added that any shortage of labour from overseas following Brexit would also affect “all sizes of farm”. While larger farms would be more impacted, the survey indicates 40% of farms with a total of five employees or fewer (171) currently rely on at least one non-UK worker in their team; all but eight of these in the sample experienced difficulties with recruitment.

The dairy industry is an important contributor to the South West's economy \n“But we as a dairy industry also need to take collective and cohesive action to improve the image of dairy farming and the attractiveness of the sector as a career option to the domestic workforce. Adopting a positive attitude and changing the message from problems to opportunities would help, potentially using advocates who have forged a successful career in the sector.” \nThe survey will be discussed further at the RABDF’s Dairy-Tech event, set to take place at Stoneleigh Park in Warwickshire on Wednesday, February 7.
