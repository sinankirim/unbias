House prices and rents will continue to rise \n\"While there has been a softening in house price increases in recent months, the outlook for the market remains positive. A lack of supply will ensure properties remain in high demand and prices continue to rise. \n\"Leaders anticipates growth of between four and five per cent nationally in 2018, with some hotspots – such as areas that are commutable from London – likely to experience even greater increases. \n\"It will be a similar story in the rental market, where high demand will continue to push up rents and provide landlords with an opportunity to enjoy a good return on their investment.\" Read More A third of properties for sale have been reduced in price - could you grab a property bargain? 2. More people will get moving \n\"The government’s recent announcement that it is scrapping stamp duty for first-time buyers will have a huge impact on the market in 2018. \n\"By making it more affordable for first-time buyers to get on the ladder, Leaders expects the entire market to get moving as a result. \n\"Demand continues to outstrip supply in the rental market too, with the company predicting this year will once again see a number of applicants competing for each available property to rent.\" Read More These are Devon's 10 biggest planned housing developments 3. Brexit negotiations will determine market confidence \n\"The great unknown in 2018 is the Brexit negotiations between the UK and the EU, with nobody yet sure how these will play out. \n\"The housing market can be sensitive to confidence levels, which are likely to be either positively or negatively affected by progress in talks between the two parties. \n\"While Brexit is unlikely to have a major impact on the UK property market, progress could lead to more people being willing to move while problems may result in reduced affordability that encourages people to stay in their homes.\" \nFor more information or advice on selling or letting a property contact your local Leaders branch or visit leaders.co.uk.
