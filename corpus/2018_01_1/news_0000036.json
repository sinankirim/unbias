Our plans put the North East at the very heart of the resurgence of the country’s manufacturing sector.” \nThe land around the Nissan plant is one of the most important develoment sites in the North East, with political and business leaders hoping the massive success of the Nissan plant can create thousands more jobs by encouraging supply firms to set up in the region. \nThe importance of the site was reflected in the fact that it last year received £42m of the £49.7m allocated to the whole of the North East as part of a Government funding package to create jobs in the region. \nAt the end of 2017, the two councils said that work could start on the site this year and that as many as 10 firms could be up and running there by autumn 2019. \nBut the rival Town End plans - and the fact that it owns a substantial part of the site - suggest that developing the land could be more complicated. \nSunderland City Council has been contacted for comment.
