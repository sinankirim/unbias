They will go on whinging and whining and moaning all the way through this process. \n“So maybe, just maybe, I’m reaching the point of thinking that we should have a second referendum on EU membership ... unless you want to have a multiple-choice referendum which would confuse people. \n“I think that if we had a second referendum on EU membership we would kill it off for a generation. \n“The percentage that would vote to leave next time would be very much bigger than it was last time round. And we may just finish the whole thing off. And Blair can disappear off into total obscurity.” Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-11T13:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-11T14:38:45.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
