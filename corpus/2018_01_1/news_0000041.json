The European Union (Withdrawal) Bill used to be called the Great Repeal Bill, and it's an essential part of leaving the European Union Share Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now Get daily updates     \nThe House of Lords is to debate a vital piece of Brexit legislation. \nAnd Theresa May could suffer a series of defeats, because while the Government has a majority in the House of Commons - thanks to the DUP working with the Conservatives - it does not have a majority in the Lords. \nThat means that Labour could succeed in amending the legislation, causing headaches for the Prime Minister. \nIt’s called the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, although it’s also been known as the Great Repeal Bill. \nBut what is it and why is it so important? What is the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill? \nIt stops the European Union having the ability to impose laws on the UK. \nSpecifically, it repeals the European Communities Act 1972, although the change only comes into force on the day that Brexit takes place. \nAnd that will mean that EU law no longer has supremacy over legislation passed by the UK Parliament and rulings made by UK courts. \nOf course, it follows the result of the EU referendum in June 2016, when the nation voted for Brexit . \nExperts have called it the most significant constitutional bill since the UK joined the EU in 1973. But it also provides continuity \nThe Bill provides “legal continuity” by copying over the entire body of EU law into UK law. \nThat means that existing EU rules and regulations will stay in force even after Brexit. They will be known as “retained EU law”. \nThe difference will be that these laws can now be abolished by the UK if it wishes. \nAccording to the Government, the idea is to provide stability rather than simply leaving huge holes in UK law on exit day. Read More Who will last longest - Theresa May or Jeremy Corbyn? Why is it controversial? \nLabour supports leaving the EU, and also supports the principle of keeping EU laws in place at first. \nHowever, there are objections to measures in the Bill which give Government Ministers the power to make changes to retained EU law. \nIn some cases, the Government will be able to change legislation which has previously been debated and voted on in Parliament. \nThis is what’s known as a “Henry VIII” power, after the Tudor monarch. \nLabour has criticised the Bill, saying iit makes Government Ministers more powerful than Parliament in some cases. \nAnd it will try to amend the legislation in the House of Lords. Read More Why is the slow pace of Brexit negotiations angering some North East politicians? What does the Government say? \nThe Government insists Henry VIII powers contained in the Bill will not be used to make significant changes, and only to make technical amendments to EU law through secondary legislation. \nPrime Minister Theresa May’s official spokesman said the measures in the Bill were required to provide certainty for business and continuity during the period of exiting the EU. \nThe Government has been clear the powers it proposes for “correcting” details within the legislation being transposed onto the UK statute book will be time-limited, said the spokesman. \nAnd he stressed that any “significant” changes would be subject to primary legislation - which means they are debated by the House of Commons - in a series of new laws covering issues like immigration, trade and customs. \nThe spokesman said: “The whole point of the repeal bill is to mean supremacy of EU law in the UK will end and all laws will be made in Westminster, Edinburgh, Cardiff or Belfast, not in Brussels. \n“That bill will provide a smooth and orderly exit from the EU and stand trade talks with the EU in good stead, since both sides will start from a point of exact equivalence.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-01-29T14:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-01-29T15:26:07.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
