Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nIt’s not strange for fans of any football club to be convinced the refs are all against them. \nEvery week expletives are aired throughout the world as a dodgy decision is put down to a conspiracy against a club. \nBut for Newcastle fans, the evidence is arguably mounting. It’s been four years since a player was sent off against United in the Premier League. In that time, 16 Mags have been shown their marching orders in England’s top flight. \nAdmittedly, Newcastle spent a year playing in the Championship, where opponents were red carded. They notably included Preston North End’s Paul Gallagher, who was sent off for handball, 14 years after the same Scot used his hand to bundle in a winner against United. \nBut in the Premier League, it’s been very much one way. Norwich City’s Bradley Johnson was the last opponent sent off against Newcastle in the top division. He was dismissed on January 28, 2014, and even then Newcastle striker Loic Remy was sent off at the same time. The last time Newcastle had a man advantage was on December 26, 2013, when Stoke City’s Glenn Whelan and Marc Wilson were directed to the stands. \nSo, with Newcastle back in action when they face Burnley at St James’ Park on Wednesday, here’s 10 things which have happened around the world since Johnson’s marching orders. Barrack Obama got replaced by a reality TV star President Donald Trump speaks about the deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville (Image: AP) \nFour years ago, the idea of Apprentice star Donald Trump running the White House seemed like a joke. In January 2014, it was still almost a year-and-a-half until Trump formally announced he would stand in the 2016 USA Presidential Election. \nFast forward four years and Trump is a year into his presidency. But Newcastle United have faced 11 men throughout every Premier League game, even when Elias Kachunga’s studs raked against Chancel Mbemba’s face. We’ve had two General Elections Theresa May during the 2017 General Election campaign \nGeneral Elections are supposed to be every five years, but Britain has gone to the polls to choose Westminster MPs twice since Johnson was sent off. In that time, Theresa May has become PM, the Conservatives lost their majority and Labour swung to the left by choosing Jeremy Corbyn as its leader. Scotland voted No NO and Yes Campaigners try to outdo each other \nThere were 10 months between Johnson’s sending off and Scotland voting no in its Independence Referendum. Since then, the SNP almost wiped out Scottish Labour in the 2015 General Election, when the nationalists won 56 of 59 seats. In 2017, the SNP won 35 of the 59. That Brexit thing The European Union Flag and United Kingdom Flag intertwined (Image: Getty Images Europe) \nWas Brexit a word in 2014? It was, apparently, as the OED has traced it back to 2012. \nBut there were still 2.5 years between Norwich City’s Braxit and the vote for Brexit. In that time, the Tories won an election with a manifesto pledge to hold a referendum. The historic Leave vote happened a little over a year later. Virgin took over the East Coast Mainline and then had the contract terminated early A Virgin East Coast train (Image: PA) \nIn the four years since Johnson was sent off at Carrow Road, Virgin East Coast won an eight year contract to run trains on the then state-run East Coast Mainline, and had its contract terminated early . A similar thing happened to Alan Pardew. Nuclear Apocolypse edges closer The Doomsday Clock is edging towards midnight (Image: Getty Images North America) \nThe world seemed safer in 2014. Not only did numerical advantages look more likely for Newcastle, but nuclear relations were much less tense. \nExperts use the “Doomsday Clock” to monitor how close we are to man made destruction. The nearer the clock is to midnight, the more imminent Armageddon is. \nIn 2015, it was moved to 11.57pm. Last year the time changed to 11.57:30. Now it’s at 11.58pm. Sunderland played in a cup final Sunderland fans at Wembley Stadium \nThe Black Cats won their 2014 League Cup semi-final four days before Newcastle’s match at Norwich. Since then, Sunderland lost their final to Manchester City and - along with Newcastle and Boro - suffered a relegation to the Championship. Rafa Benitez has managed Napoli, Real Madrid and Newcastle Newcastle United manager Rafa Benitez (Image: Getty Images Europe) \nIn January 2014, Rafa was on his way to guiding Napoli to a third place finish in Serie A. Between then and now, he won the Coppa Italia, spent another season in Italy, took over at Real Madrid, was sacked, and joined Newcastle.
