X \nCopy link to paste in your message / Comments (0) \nEast Midlands UKIP MEP Margot Parker has said a public subscription scheme to buy a new £120 million Royal Yacht Britannia for the Queen would be a good idea. \nIn a letter to the Mercury, Ms Parker said she found herself in 'rare agreement' with Tory MPs who are campaigning to replace the original luxury yacht, which was decommissioned in 1997. \nThe Government has stressed provision of a new £120 million yacht is not a priority. \nMargot Parker \nBut Ms Parker said: \"Having played a significant part in securing billions of pounds of trade in the past it could well prove a vital tool for doing the same post-Brexit, raising our prestige and profile as we reclaim our place as an independent global player. \n\"While I have some sympathy with diverting part of our extravagant foreign aid budget towards domestic expenditure, I believe there are better places where that money could be spent. \n\"The suggestion various government departments divide the £100m cost of a new yacht between them is also impossible to justify given cuts to services almost everywhere. \n\"Funding the yacht through private donations seems to be the way to go, although safeguards need to be in place to prevent corporate donors benefiting inappropriately. \n\"Perhaps a mixture of funding sources would be best – private donations as well as running costs or a 'usage fee' paid by Government departments who avail themselves of the yacht \n\"A public subscription might also be a good idea – I am sure many people would be more than happy to donate to a 'present' for Her Majesty in thanks for her decades of service.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-10-14T23:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-10-14T19:31:09.207+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
