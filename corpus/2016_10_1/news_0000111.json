The idea is that this knowledge will allow them – and the construction firms that employ them – to become more savvy about slashing carbon consumption on property developments and other building projects. \nEsh Group said the scheme would help to drive up industry standards and fast-track of pipeline of new talent into the sector. \nRita Callender, business improvement manager at Esh, said: “The idea is to capture these young people early and train them so that they have the skills they need to be successful in the industry. They can then influence other people and become a champion of best practice. We want them to pass on what they’ve learned to others as that’s the best way of improving the industry and making it more competitive. \n“The course is about two key things: tackling a skills shortage in the construction industry and meeting carbon reduction targets. As far as I’m aware there’s nothing like this in the industry.” Northumbria University and Parker domnic hunter representatives work on the knowledge transfer partnership.

The organisation said it was impressed by Esh Group’s ambitions for its workforce and its commitment to sustainability. \nGeeta Nathan, head of economic analysis at CITB, said: “We are proud to fund a project committed to providing apprentices with the skills and training that will benefit the industry and the environment. \n“The course will have a positive impact in the region and provide the next generation of construction workers with high-quality, innovative training to give them the best start to their careers.” \nEsh has a strong track record of championing workforce development. The £300m turnover company employs around 1,200 staff, of which 150 are apprentices – more than 10% of its workforce. \nEsh also makes an effort to engage with education providers to get young people interested in construction. \nIt has teamed up with more than 70 primary schools to deliver its STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) programme, which gives children a fun insight into the industry. The firm also works with secondary schools and colleges through its award-winning Building My Skills project, which was created in partnership with construction firms Arup, Ryder and Turner Townsend. \nMs Callender said: “It’s vital that we inspire more people to come into our industry. I’ve found that our apprentices bring new blood into the business and give a fresh insight. Some companies might think they’re a draw on resources but I think they’re hugely important. They’re keen, sharp, dedicated and a valuable resource for us.” \nEsh is now seeking to persuade at least 10 companies in its supply chain to adopt its sustainability programme, a move that will allow more people to acquire vital skills in this field. Effective partnership working is a theme that runs through many other successful skills initiatives in the North East. \nNorthumbria University specialises in Knowledge Transfer Partnerships (KTPs), where academics are drafted into businesses to help them solve a particular problem or make a strategic step-change in the way they operate. The idea is to give businesses the tools and knowledge to improve competitiveness, productivity and performance. Meanwhile, students are given valuable work experience in a company while completing their studies and the university benefits by acquiring knowledge that can shape future research. Fraser McLeay, professor of strategic marketing management at Northumbria University’s Newcastle Business School \nNorthumbria has been involved in several KTPs, including one with engineering firm Parker domnick hunter. The university’s School of Design and Newcastle Business School worked with the Gateshead-based company, which makes compressed air and gas treatment technologies, on a two-year KTP designed to unearth new ways of developing, branding and selling these products. \nEllie Jones, a strategic marketing associate from the business school, and industrial designer Callum Whitehead from the design school, helped Parker to find new applications for its products and make operational efficiencies that would reduce the time taken to bring a product to market. \nParker said the KTP had the potential to “add several million pounds to our sales”. \nNeil McPherson, division marketing manager at the company, said: “About three years ago we undertook a review of our core strengths within the business. We found that we didn’t have an industrial design capability and didn’t really have a strategic marketing function either. As a result of the KPI our sales and engineering departments are more aligned with each other and we’ve identified two new market development opportunities that we’ve been able to progress.” \nHe said the KTP had brought “out-of-the-box thinking into our business” and encouraged Parker to give a design makeover to some products that had carried the same appearance for 40 years. \n“If you went to a Ford garage you wouldn’t expect to buy a car that was made 40 years ago,” he said. “The KTP has helped us to re-energise activities in certain areas and encouraged us to bring younger people into the business, such as apprentices.” \nThe project also showcased the problem-solving skills, effective teamwork and business acumen of the two Northumbria students – with demonstrable results.

Because I work closely with Callum in a cross-faculty approach, we can show that the most cost-effective and profitable way of taking new products to market is when design and marketing complement each other by working together. By increasing flexibility in the process we’ve also shown that the time taken from concept to development stage can be significantly reduced from around 6-12 months to just 6-12 weeks. The positive impact of this can be huge.” \nThe project also brought healthy benefits to Northumbria, which was recognised for its sterling KTP work in the most recent Times Higher Education Awards in which it was named UK Business School of the Year. The university has also worked on KTPs with Renown Engineering, which increased sales by £4m as a result of the project, and chemical manufacturing giant Thomas Swan. \nFraser McLeay, professor of strategic marketing management at Newcastle Business School, said: “KTPs are a great way for businesses and universities to work together and share knowledge. From a university perspective it’s great to have academics working in businesses such as Parker domnick hunter. It allows us to bring knowledge back into the university and helps the development of the graduates. \n“All universities in the North East are involved in KTPs in some capacity but I don’t think that a lot of businesses realise the true value of them. Each business has the potential to make an extra £1m if they get involved in a KTP.” Seaward learners are in a different class Seaward’s successful manufacturing staff with their training certificates.
