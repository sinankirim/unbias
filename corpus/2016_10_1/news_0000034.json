Yet the uncertainty of Brexit could seriously compromise the continued resurgence of this world class industry. \n“Dozens of decisions, including new models to UK plants, must be made in the coming months. These crucial investment decisions will determine the future of the UK’s car industry. Ministers’ mixed signals on tariff-free access to the single market, which consumes 80% of the cars we produce, could leave our world class industry hanging by a thread. \n“While many workers voted to leave the EU, they didn’t do so to be out of work or see their living standards suffer and rights at work torn up through a ‘Hard Brexit’. \n“The Government’s commitment to an industrial strategy is welcome, but it will not get out of the starting blocks unless our manufacturing sector receives tariff-free access to the single market and the assistance and commitments it needs to invest in a Brexit Britain.” Read More Brexit vote revealed divided society, warns Chancellor Philip Hammond \nThe report commissioned by Unite says that suggestions by some Ministers to revert to World Trade Organisation (WTO) tariffs of 10% on exports and 4% on imports would damage a resurgent UK car industry and well-paying manufacturing jobs. \nReport author David Bailey, a professor of industry at Aston University, said: “Automotive and engine assemblers like General Motors, BMW and Ford all import sizable inflows of components to the UK from other European Union operations. \n“Anything which puts these trading relationships at risk, whether currency risk or higher transaction costs from having to deal with EU and UK regulations separately, reduce the likelihood of further investment.” \nJames Ramsbotham, chief executive of the North East England Chamber of Commerce, said: “With the automotive sector being such a major part of the business community in the North East the future of the car-making is of crucial importance to our economy and employment prospects. \n“As we have done since the end of June, we urge the Government to ensure the brightest possible future for our members and the region.” \nSharon Hodgson, MP for Washington and Sunderland West, said: “The evidence released by Unite the Union shows exactly why we need to have a concrete plan from Theresa May and her Brexiteer Secretaries of State, especially on the single market, as this could put our vital automotive industry, both here in the North East and across the country, in jeopardy. \n\"We cannot allow the Government to walk us off the cliff edge without giving us a clear Brexit plan that protects our economy, our industries and people’s jobs and livelihoods. \n“Car manufacturing plants, such as Nissan in Sunderland, have already warned about their futures in post-Brexit Britain and this further evidence shows the Government needs to be doing much more to ensure the production of cars here in the UK remains, rather than leaves to go abroad, and we don’t lose these vital and high-quality jobs that come with the levels of investment from automotive companies.” More on the EU Referendum", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-10-12T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-10-12T00:32:30.566+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
