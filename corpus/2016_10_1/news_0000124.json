which is chaired by North East MP Iain Wright - says that the bank should be given a new performance measurement to “assess its effectiveness in incentivising lending and investment activity in all parts of the UK”. \nThe committee’s report says: “The new Prime Minister has already spoken of her desire for opportunity and economic success to be more fairly distributed across the UK, and we look forward to learning how the Government intends to use the various levers at its disposal to make this happen. \n“Enabling entrepreneurs to start their own business, and ensure they can access finance as they grow, can have an important role in rebalancing economic growth across the UK. \n“The willingness of the Government to intervene where there are identifiable market failures in the business landscape across the whole UK represents a test and an opportunity in the context of its new industrial strategy.” Coventry Telegraph Archive Dr Adam Marshall \nThe committee highlights fears that the June 23 vote to leave the EU will have repercussions for access to finance and warns too that the European Investment Bank has provided large amounts of money to underpin finance for business that could be lost when the Brexit process is complete. \nThe Start-Up Loans company - which recently announced it had provided £10m to help North East companies - is singled out as a “good and effective way” to support new entrepreneurs. \nResponding to the report, Dr Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: “Access to finance remains an issue for many growing businesses, and the problem is often greater the further a firm is from the angels and venture capital firms concentrated inside the M25. \n“We welcome the committee’s support for an even-stronger regional dimension to the Government’s business finance initiatives. The work of the British Business Bank and others to create investment funds focused on the Northern Powerhouse, the Midlands Engine and other areas away from the capital can and should be intensified.” \nTim Sawyer, CEO at the Start Up Loans Company, said: “Small businesses are often referred to as the lifeblood of the economy, and start-ups play an instrumental role in this. That’s why it’s great to see such a demand for funding from potential business owners up and down the country. \n“Achieving £10m of lending in the North East is a key milestone for the Start Up Loans Company and we are keen to help many more business ideas come to fruition. \n“Since 2012, our funding and comprehensive package of free business support has helped to create jobs and launch many great business ideas. As a result, the scheme has delivered more than £3 of value to the economy for every £1 invested.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-10-31T21:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-10-31T17:00:09.587+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
