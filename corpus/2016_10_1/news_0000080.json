And they said no. \n“It’s the first region that’s said no to such an invitation. \n“And since then it’s been quite clear what the reaction has been from local businesses, local investors, asking why would you say ‘no’ to something that’s going to lead to more jobs and growth? \n“And that’s for them to explain why they said no.” \nHowever, a separate deal with the three councils that backed devolution was under discussion, he said. \n“There are three of the seven that wanted this deal, but they understand you needed a majority to go forward. \n“So they’ve approached us and said ‘look, can we talk about another deal?’ And we are discussing with them. \n“The deal would be very different and it will be on a very different timeframe. We’ve said we are happy to look at and discuss other options, but it is very early days.” Read More Council chiefs hold devolution talks with Whitehall - but what's the latest for the North East deal? \nAsked if Newcastle, Northumberland and North Tyneside could have their own mayor, he said it was possible but a mayor might not be suitable for a smaller area. \n“I’m not ruling anything out but it’s too early to say what a deal could look like. \n“To have a mayor, you need a workable economic zone. And I don’t think we’ve done enough work on that yet. But we are very open to discussions.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-10-05T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-10-05T07:32:04.636+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
