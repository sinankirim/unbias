But speaking in June, before the referendum, Hitachi chairman Hiroaki Nakanishi warned: “Take away the UK’s membership of the EU, and the future investment case looks very different.” \nInternational trade minister Mark Garnier told the House of Commons Mr Clark plans to hold talks with Hitachi to ensure investment continues, following successful talks with Nissan. Inside Hitachi train factory at Newton Aycliffe \nThe business secretary travelled to Japan earlier in October to meet Nissan bosses, and reportedly offered the carmaker reassurances which persuaded it to produce the next Qashqai car in the UK. \nMinisters have not revealed what exactly he promised Nissan to secure the investment. Read More Nissan secures 7,000 jobs by confirming Qashqai will be built in North East \nAn official announcement about the Qashqai is expected in November. \nMr Garnier told MPs: “The secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy has met Nissan and will be meeting Hitachi to try to make sure that the investment ... secured remains in the UK.” \nHe was speaking in the House of Commons during a debate about the impact leaving the European Union will have on the North East. Ian Nicholson/PA Wire Sedgefield MP Phil Wilson \nThe Conservative Minister praised Phil Wilson, Labour MP for Sedgefield, saying: “He was instrumental in securing the investment from Hitachi in his constituency, which we should all recognise.” \nMr Garnier told MPs that trade with the EU was important for the North East, adding: “The single market is a destination for more than 61% of the region’s exports.” Read More Nissan investment shows Brexit can work - but what did we offer in return? \nBut the Minister also insisted that quitting the EU could benefit the region by allowing the UK to sign trade deals with other countries. \n“Today, a car manufactured in the UK and sold to India would face tariffs of up to 100%. The tariff for selling the same car to Brazil is less at 35% and for China it is 25%. \n“We can do deals with those markets and find opportunities for cheaper tariffs there. Inside Hitachi train factory at Newton Aycliffe \n“A UK in full control of its trading arrangements can start to address the barriers that exist. There is untapped potential in the global economy that the UK is primed to take advantage of.” \nSpeaking in the same debate, Sunderland Central MP Julie Elliott said that firms in the automotive supply chain might also need support to help them cope with the effects of Brexit. \nShe said: “Even if some sort of agreement is made for the automotive industry, it would not necessarily include all the companies in Nissan’s supply chain. Those companies produce many parts for cars built in Sunderland and in other parts of the country but, because they also produce parts for other companies’ manufacturing, they may not be entirely protected by a special arrangement for the automotive industry.” Wearside MP Bridget Phillipson \nBridget Phillipson, MP for Houghton and Sunderland South, welcomed the work the Government has done to reassure Nissan, but also highlighted the need to support firms which supply parts and services to the carmaker. \n“I sincerely hope that the decision on where to build the next Qashqai is a positive one for Sunderland. I will welcome any steps Ministers can take to assuage the company’s fears. \n“What will require greater clarity from Ministers is the degree to which small and medium-sized businesses in my constituency and in the supply chain will be protected. \n“Those businesses are already suffering from the collapse of sterling and the uncertainty that has dogged the economy since June. \n“If ministers intend to offer the automotive sector special protection from the impact of Brexit, presumably on the basis that they intend to take our country out of the single market, it must have wider coverage and not ignore small and medium-sized enterprises in the North East and beyond.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-10-28T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-10-27T21:12:16.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
