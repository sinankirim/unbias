When will the Government act on real people’s jobs and reassure companies? \n“That is what is at stake. This is not chatter; it is real people’s jobs. When will the Government act?” Read More Nissan jobs are 'hanging by a thread' over Brexit, union warns \nBut Mr Davis was unable to provide any specifics in his reply, telling her: “We have said in terms - principally after the Japanese letter - that we are absolutely determined to make sure that we guarantee, or acquire, access for all companies in the UK to the maximum possible number of markets. That is what we are doing.” \nMPs have also raised concerns about the Government’s apparent plans to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, the formal mechanism for leaving the EU, without a Commons vote. \nBishop Auckland MP Helen Goodman described the Government’s explanation as “nonsensical”.
