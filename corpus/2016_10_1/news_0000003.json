Owen Humphreys/PA Wire A combine harvester in a field \nEU subsidies of more than £3bn were paid out last year, most in direct payments to landowners for their land – with an investigation by Greenpeace revealing wealthy aristocrats and a Saudi land-owning prince were among recipients. \nBut across the UK, around three quarters of which is farmed, an estimated 56% of native wildlife species are in decline, experts warn. 08:16 Workers stressed out by long hours and colleagues \nGetting that Monday morning feeling? \nMost workers believe their employers look down on anyone who gets stressed and do not offer any support, a report shows.Research among 1,200 employees found that bad management was the biggest cause of stress at work as well as long hours and unfriendly colleagues.Lee Biggins of job site CV-Library, which conducted the study, said: \nAs a nation, we are battling with heavier workloads and longer working hours and this is resulting in a poor work/life balance for many. While it can be difficult to take a step back from work, especially with an increasing amount of technology at our fingertips, creating a balance between our professional and personal lives is important. For employers, high stress levels not only impact overall productivity, but can also place organisations in a compromising position, as workers under a great amount of strain are more likely to turn on their heels and look for a better working environment elsewhere. This makes it more important than ever for management teams to take on the responsibility for keeping their staff happy and productive in the workplace and help to alleviate some of the pressures that their employees are facing. 08:06 Kathryn Riddell Coal orders increase for Hargreaves \nEnergy group Hargreaves has reported an increase in coal sales after a torrid period in its core market. \nThe County Durham-based company, which also operates in the infrastructure and property markets, has issued a series of downbeat statements over the last 18 months as the global retreat from coal burning hit its main area of operation. \nBut in a trading update, the company said it had seen increasing orders from coal-fired power stations and had begun shipments of coal worth £11m that it expected to continue through the winter. \nThe company, which holds its AGM on Wednesday, last week lost a tribunal relating to 154 employees who worked at the former SSI steel plant at Redcar. Anna Gowthorpe/PA Wire SSI Steelworks in Redcar \nIt said it was “disappointed” by the ruling and that it would potentially cost it an extra £600,000 to the sum it had already budgeted for the Redcar plant’s closure. \nHargreaves Chairman David Morgan said: “We are pleased that the increasing interest from coal power stations noted in the Preliminary Results Statement has now been translated into contracts for the sale of the Group’s surplus coal stocks. \n“Shipments of these coal stocks, totalling approximately £11m, have already commenced and will continue through the winter in line with expectations and without any impairment to book value. \n“Trading across the rest of the Group for the year to date has been in line with expectations.” 08:00 Kathryn Riddell Good morning! \nHello and welcome to the Journal Business team’s morning live blog for Friday, September 30 - the last one for the week. \nI’m Kathryn Riddell and I’m running the live blog to bring you regular updates on all the breaking business news from across the North East and beyond. \nThe business breakfast live blog covers the latest big stories from the region’s business community, as well as national news, FTSE updates and stock exchange announcements from the Journal region’s listed companies and national firms - anything and everything from the world of business basically. \nSo let’s get started.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-10-03T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-10-03T10:25:21.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
