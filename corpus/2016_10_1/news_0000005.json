South Shields MP Emma Lewell-Buck \nMPs who returned to the front bench after resigning earlier in the year include South Shields MP Emma Lewell-Buck, the new Shadow Minister for Children and Families. \nShe was previously a Shadow Housing Minister, but quit in June saying she was “heartbroken at the state of the party”.

She was previously a children’s minister before her resignation. \nRoberta Blackman-Woods, MP for City of Durham, returns as a housing minister, the same job she held before her resignation. \nAnd North West Durham MP Pat Glass, who was previously Shadow Minister for Europe and briefly Shadow Education Secretary, returns as a Shadow Transport Minister responsible for rail policy. She had resigned citing the pressure on her family, stemming partly from the divisive EU referendum. Ian Forsyth/Getty Images Pat Glass MP \nExplaining her decision to return to the front bench, Ms Blackman-Woods said: “I decided that we have had the election that Jeremy won comprehensively, and the best thing Labour MPs could do was to get behind him and be the most effective opposition that we can.” \nIn her housing role she would be focusing on the need to build more homes, improving protection for private sector tenants and more, she said, \nMs Glass said: “Mine was a personal rather than a political resignation. But I felt it was time to come back because we need to be a credible opposition.” Read More Give refugee children a home in the UK, says Newcastle leader Nick Forbes \nShe said she was also keen to take on the rail role because involved promoting Labour’s plans to bring rail services back into public control. \n“The train operators are taking none of the risk and all of the profit. Taxpayers and passengers are getting a terrible deal and we need to change that.” Ian Lavery MP for Wansbeck speaks at the 2016 Labour Conference in Liverpool \nSome Labour MPs who stayed on the front bench throughout the leadership contest have been promoted. \nIan Lavery, Labour MP for Wansbeck, moves up from a role as Shadow Minister for Civil Society to become the Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office. \nThis is a shadow cabinet-level role, and was previously held by Tom Watson, Labour’s Deputy Leader, who has become the party’s new Shadow Culture Secretary. \nIt means he joins North East MPs who were already in the shadow cabinet, including Middlesbrough MP Andy McDonald, the Shadow Transport Secretary; Blaydon MP Dave Anderson, who continues in the dual role of Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland and Northern Ireland, and Easington MP Grahame Morris, the Shadow Local Government Secretary. \nMr Morris is on leave because he is being treated for lymphatic cancer, and his role is currently being filled by London MP Teresa Pearce. Grahame Morris \nHe said: “I am fine and receiving the best of care from the NHS.” \nMr Lavery added: “I’m pleased to see frontbenchers returning so that we can focus our attention on the Conservative Government. \n“It’s been a long blood letting summer. There’s an absolute need to draw a line under the unpleasantness and serve as an effective opposition. \n“I’m convinced that others will return so that we can achieve our parliamentary objectives.” \nThere was also a new role for Newcastle Central MP Chi Onwurah, who remained on the front bench throughout the leadership election despite making some public criticism of Mr Corbyn. Chi Onwurah \nShe is now Shadow Minister for Industrial Strategy, a significant post because Theresa May’s Government is in the process of drawing up an industrial strategy for the UK which will be a key part of the Prime Minister’s programme. \nConservative Business Secretary Greg Clark has said he plans to create an industrial strategy to benefit every region of the country. \nOne of the most significant changes, announced last week at the start of the reshuffle, was the appointment of Newcastle East MP Nick Brown as Opposition Chief Whip. \nOther key appointments included London MP Diane Abbott becoming Shadow Home Secretary and former Liberty chair Shami Chakrabarti, now a Labour peer, becoming Shadow Attorney General. \nSome critics have accused Mr Corbyn of appointing a Shadow Cabinet dominated by London MPs, as the shadow Home Secretary, Foreign Secretary, Chancellor, Brexit Secretary and Mr Corbyn himself all represent London seats. \nHowever, there are also many North East MPs in the Shadow Cabinet and front bench.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-10-11T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-10-10T20:17:56.278+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
