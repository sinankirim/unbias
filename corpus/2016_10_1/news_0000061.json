Plans for 1972 Act repeal set in motion by PM. All that campaigning to get control back worth the fight!” \nMrs May’s announcement follows June’s EU Referendum, where 52% of the country voted in favour of Leaving the European Union. \nThe majority of voters in Sunderland, South Tyneside, North Tyneside, Gateshead, County Durham and Northumberland backed the Leave campaign. In Newcastle, 50.7% voted in favour of remaining in the EU.
