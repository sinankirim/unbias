Leave campaigners celebrate as they win the vote in Sunderland during the North East region European Union referendum count on June 24, 2016 \nMr Ghosn said: “We’re not asking for any advantage (from the British government), but we don’t want to lose any competitiveness no matter what the discussions.” \nHe said he had received reassurance that the British government would be “extremely cautious” in “preserving the competitiveness” of the Sunderland plant . \n“As long as I have this guarantee ... I can look at the future of Sunderland with more ease,” he said. \nProduction of the next Qashqai model is expected to begin around 2018 or 2019. \nBusinesses have been concerned that Britain is headed towards a “hard Brexit”, which would leave it outside the single market and facing tariffs of up to 10% on car exports. \nIf Nissan decides not to produce the next Qashqai SUV at Sunderland it would be a massive blow for the regional economy. \nAnd those who campaigned for the UK to stay in the EU might think it would be bitterly ironic. \nOn the night of the EU referendum it was the Sunderland vote which was overwhelmingly for Leave which first hinted at a win for Brexit. \nThis was despite concerns expressed in the campaign about the future of Nissan which were dismissed by Brexiteers as part of ‘Project Fear’.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-10-21T19:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-10-21T14:47:13.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
