X \nCopy link to paste in your message / Comments (0) \nSeveral Leicester Mercury readers have expressed their interest in helping shape future economic policy following the Brexit vote. \nThe Bank of England is holding an event at the National Space Centre, in Leicester, this month, and is inviting readers to speak to Minouche Shafik, deputy governor for markets and banking and a member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). \nThe event is being held as part of a commitment by the Bank to come out into the provinces and hear public opinion. \nSo far, several readers have come forward to take part in the event on October 14 from 10am to 12.30pm. \nIt is part of series of roundtable events that are also taking place in Derby and Nottingham. \nBill Piper, 60, Lutterworth, said he was interested in attending the event because he is concerned about the Bank of England's predictions about the economy pre-Brexit. \nHe said: \"I think that the vote to leave the EU is one of the most important things to have happened to this country in the last 40 years. \n\"Prior to the vote, the BoE said that if the UK voted to leave the EU it would be the end of the economy as we know it and that hasn't happened. I want to know why they said that. \n\"Was it because they were part of project fear or was it just a hypothesis? \nRead more: Your chance to grill the Bank of England \n\"If they were part of project fear, how can we trust it? If it was the latter, how did they manage to get the prognosis so wrong? We should be able to rely on it.\" \nEdward Spalton, chaiman of the organisation Campaign for an Independent Britain (CIB), said: \"I want to find out more about how the financial things work. It's all a mystery to me. \n\"I want to know what they think will happen with the exchange rate. The fall in the value of sterling has been very helpful to exports so far.\" \nGeorge West, 81, of Groby, who is president of the organisation, said: \"I'm very interested in what they have to say. Following the referendum, we must remain vigilant and watch out for any backsliding.\" \nAvtar Singh, of Oadby, said: \"I'd like to understand the BoE/Government's economic and monetary policy. I realise there's probably a very good and simple reason they can't simply print the money but the last time I asked an economist he couldn't tell me what it is.\" \nThere are 30 places at the event and it includes a buffet lunch.
