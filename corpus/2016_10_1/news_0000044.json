Sharma, consul general of India, Birmingham, discussing the opportunity for UK businesses in India and Geoff Wain, British Deputy High Commissioner in Ahmedabad, speaking about how Gujarat is a great area of opportunity. \nRepresentatives from Horus Music, Horiba MIRA, Curve and East Midlands Airport also spoke about their experiences of trading in India. \nThe event was held as part of Leicester Business Festival. \nHelen Donnellan, inward investment director at Leicester City Council who chaired the event, said: \"The reason we put the event on was to encourage more Leicester businesses to export and invest to complement our international approach to trade and inward investment. \n\"A lot of that has followed because of Brexit. We see India as a great opportunity and we want our businesses to exploit that. \n\"We were really pleased with the interest and excitement that businesses had about trading, exporting and investing in India. \n\"We think it will be a huge boost to our community if these businesses get involved.\" \nMukesh Patel, managing partner of Freeths law firm in Leicester, attended the event. \nHe said: \"I really wanted to find out what opportunities there are in India. \n\"My parents are from Gujarat and we have historical and cultural connections with India that go back decades. \n\"I think, more than ever, the time feels right to forge these links. I thought it was very encouraging hearing how keen they are on working with the UK for education and businesses as well.\" \nElsewhere, a jobs fair was held by North West Leicestershire District Council, Jobcentre Plus, and Stephenson College in Coalville. \nWorkshops were put on by Vistage, University of Leicester, and Terry Foursey Consulting to give businesses advice about expanding their operations. \nIn the afternoon, The Be Happy Yoga Project ran a yoga class for Leicester Business Festival visitors. \nCo-founder Danielle Texeira said: \"We're really keen to build our business in a social enterprise model and teach people who can't access yoga, such as ex offenders. \n\"The aim is to grow the business so that the people who can pay for the yoga classes help to subsidise the classes for those that can't.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-10-31T21:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-10-31T18:43:13.682+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
