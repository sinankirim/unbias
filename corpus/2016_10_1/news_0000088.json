Most people referred to the local corner shop as the “Paki shop” and openly used derogatory terms such as “Pakis”, “Darkies” and “Chinks” (the Chinese) in public. \nGolliwogs existed as playthings and as a logo for Robertson’s marmalade. The Black and White Minstrel Show – where white musicians painted their faces dark and pretended to be stereotypical black people – was popular on TV until 1978. \nGay people were the subject of rude jokes that I won’t mention, especially when the AIDS epidemic came to light in the 1980s. \nWe had blatant sexism too. If you took your car to the mechanic, the walls would be festooned with topless pin-ups from Page 3 of ‘The Sun’. “The Wife” was not necessarily an equal: she might be expected to do the washing up and iron hubby’s pants while he went down the pub and guzzled beer with his mates. \nAt this time, “political correctness” was not well-advanced. The fields of racial and gender equality needed further effort. By the 2000s, continuous legislation and hard work had ensured that a more tolerant and diverse society existed in Britain and could be promoted world-wide. If people didn’t like their neighbours who hailed from a different country or culture, they would usually not shout about it, not publicly, at least. This was considered un-politically correct (“un-PC”). The National Front, which was at its peak in the 70s, then the BNP existed to promote an idea of White Britain but was thankfully considered extremist by most people. \nI never imagined we would turn back the clock. \nBut like a fortress that took years to build, a seemingly stable structure can be blown up overnight - for example, by the Brexit vote. Tensions that were clearly bubbling under the surface have recently spewed out in public. Pandora’s Box has been opened and I am not sure it can be closed again. \nFast forward to July 2016, a handful of days after the EU Referendum . I am standing in a Scottish hotel reception alongside an elderly British man who, seemingly without thinking, asks an Indian receptionist “where did you manage to escape from”? The receptionist looks surprised but remains unfazed. \nWhile this was rather un-PC remark was meant to be a harmless joke, four months after the referendum, it strikes me that questioning other people’s origins has become commonplace in Britain and being ‘PC’ is in rapid decline, with right wing politicians failing to uphold these standards in public. \nStrikingly, Home Secretary Amber Rudd recently wished to “name and shame” UK companies that employ too many foreign workers. How must this make EU workers in the UK feel about their value and future? How does it make the UK look overseas? \nFurthermore, a census was distributed by UK schools that asked parents to state their child’s nationality and county of birth. The document stated that parents of children born in the UK who are British Nationals need not complete it, and that it was for “data purposes” only. None of this is calming the rising tide of xenophobia. \nFuelled by the propaganda printed by the Daily Express and Daily Mail, UK citizens who have decided they don’t like “Johnny Foreigner” and think he has taken “British jobs for British people” – including the ones British people won’t do, such as fruit picking, cleaning and shift work in hotels – now feel enfranchised to say “where did you come from and why don’t you **** off back there”. Immigrants are also receiving short shrift. \nUgly material has been appearing on Facebook groups aimed at Leavers and those on the Right. One of the worst comments I saw suggested that refugees should be “sent to gas chambers and turned into bars of soap”. I doubt that this comment would have appeared on a public forum before June 23. \nSome extremists feel that it is OK to burn down Polish shops and beat up people who speak in Eastern European accents. This is not just a big step backwards in race-relations: it is ugly and should have no place in “Great” Britain. I worry that the recent hate crimes haven’t been sufficiently discouraged. Even French people who have lived here for two decades are reporting to their Embassy that they have been the subject of racist behaviour, based on their accents. \nThe Journal recently reported that Newcastle school children believed immigrants would be “sent back home” after Brexit – a view that is clearly coming from the adults, as well as from the tabloid press. But… many of these “immigrants” are third-generation, born in the UK to parents who have lived here for decades. “Home” to them has always been England. \nMeanwhile, of the 4.5 million Brits living abroad, 1.3 million have migrated into Europe. A recent poll for the Independent on Sunday found that 52% of Brits want to be “free to live and work anywhere in the European Union” while just 36% believe our fellow Europeans have the same right to live and work in Britain and 46% hated the idea. This is clearly a case of ‘have your cake and eat it’. \nI am one of those migrated Brits. I live with my two school-age children in the Sierra Nevada mountains near Granada in southern Spain. Unlike expats who hang out in English bars eating pies and mash, we have integrated with the Spanish community and my children are bilingual, which will stand them in good stead work-wise. \nAs with many other British expats, I was shocked by the result of June 23. It was like waking up into a bad dream, with the rug being pulled from under our feet. Some expats feel bereft. Furthermore, the UK’s recent bizarre behaviour is embarrassing when viewed from another EU country which isn’t being xenophobic. Writer Jo Chipchase, originally from Newcastle, now lives with her family in Spain \nI consider myself a “British European” who is happy to live alongside people of all nationalities and persuasions. My sons were born British Europeans, with EU passports. I took this right for granted – that we can move freely through EU countries and that my sons will have this freedom when they graduate. Now, this could all be taken away. We might need visas to visit our family in Newcastle and to re-enter Spain. We might be required to jump through unknown hoops to stay in Spain where our lives are based: nobody has a crystal ball to predict what will happen. \nWhile the Brexit chaos continues in the UK, we are losing about 20% of our family income because Pound Sterling has plummeted against the Euro since the Referendum and various forecasts say that the two currencies could reach parity soon. We are a normal single-parent family, not some lavish “expat tycoons” whooping it up in Marbella. I am not alone in worrying about our future: expats are widely voicing similar concerns about being used as “bargaining chips”. \nLuckily, the Spanish are not reacting to British expats in an equally xenophobic way. It does happen on rare occasions. For example, a Spanish father from my town publicly ridiculed my awkward Spanish and said “the English should go back to England”. A group of Spanish mothers once pointed and laughed at me. Occasionally, older Spanish people don’t want to speak to the ‘guiri’ with the ‘Spanglish’ accent but most people are magnanimous. I think that having open Schengen borders leads to greater tolerance of one’s neighbours. \nMeanwhile, some unsympathetic readers of the ‘Express’ and ‘Sun’ suggest that those “expats sunning themselves” in Spain should return to Britain. A Britain that is, to my mind, becoming increasingly divided and less attractive, with Brexit producing a whole new vocabulary for its population. Instead of being your friends and family, people are now “Little Englanders”, “patronising Bremoaners”, “the sneering Liberal elite” or – the one that will go down in history - “citizens of nowhere”. \nAn uncivil war of words is raging on social media and it’s not ending any time soon. Recurring themes from Leavers are: “Suck it up – we won!”, “unpatriotic Remainers”, “subverting the will of the people”, “OUT means OUT” and “restore our Sovereignty now”. \nMeanwhile, the Remainers are guilty of calling Leavers “Little Englanders”, “morons”, “knuckle draggers” and worse. All filters of polite behaviour have been removed. There’s currently very little civilised debate between the two sides, despite many people wanting to try to establish a constructive dialogue, as it usually descends into insults. \nBut… how can Remainers be expected to “suck it up” when they number 48% of the Referendum voters. A recent poll suggested that 6% of Leave voters are experiencing ‘Bregret’ about their vote. This number would have been enough to create a marginal Remain win on June 23. Then, would the Leavers have “sucked it up”? People don’t just “stop whingeing” and change their minds – to expect them to do so is, in itself, undemocratic and against freedom of speech. \nRecently, the tone has turned more sinister. According to the Express, “Bremoaners” should be “silenced”. MP Christian Holliday launched a petition to adapt UK “treason” laws to prosecute those who advocate re-joining the EU after Brexit, and was later suspended from his job. One Express reader added that Remainers should “not be tried – just shoot them”. Others have said “I’ll happily kill a few” in the cause of “sovereignty”. Read More Who are we? A country that doesn’t take care of the young, sick, poor or elderly \nThese are warlike words, with the Mail and Express filling their pages with “post-truth” propaganda. I feel that there should be greater press regulation with regards to accuracy and responsibility towards the public. \nWith the tabloids enjoying their greatest power since the early 1990s, and manipulating every Brexit angle, British people are sadly becoming divided by what “side” they are on. I recently fell out with relatives (who don’t own passports and have never set foot in Europe!) because they are Leavers and I’m a Remainer. The accusations of “Little Englander” and “Bremoaner” flew, before a truce was eventually drawn: in the end, family relationships are more important than scoring cheap points. \nI know various 40-somethings who have fallen out with their beloved parents and grandparents over Brexit and one Remain-voting grandmother who isn’t speaking to a Leave-voting niece. A lady of the Remain camp reported having issues with her Leave-voting husband, undoubtedly making for lively discussions over the dinner table… or stony silence. These are emotionally-charged times. \nI believe the Facebook generation has played a large part in Brexit. It is easy to “like”, “share” and then – perhaps - vote for something based largely on an emotional reaction. It is also easy to adopt an anonymous persona, troll online forums, insult the enemy that you cannot see face-to-face and then band together in special-interest groups. \n‘Britain for Europe’ is one constructive new group, that has been created to campaign for the rights of thousands of people who stand to lose them. Other new groups on Facebook aim to bring Remainers and Leavers together, if they can find common ground. \nI hope the uncivil war of words remains what it is – an online spat that is sometimes strangely fascinating. I am reminded of Royalists and Parliamentarians (aka Cavaliers and Roundheads) but with the Leavers pitted against the Remainers… or is it the Patriots against the Metropolitan Liberal Elite or the Little Englanders against the Bremoaners? \nHave we forgotten that we are just people – yes, citizens of the world - who need to overcome what has descended into a worrying rift in society? Does Britain really want to backtrack 40 years in its role as a modern and tolerant land? Will it end in civil unrest? I think it could. Meanwhile, people in other countries, including Spain, are expressing their bemusement at the strange behaviour of Brexit Britain... And I really cannot blame them for their incredulity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-10-31T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-10-30T20:15:46.450+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
