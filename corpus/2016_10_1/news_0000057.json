Now, if the UK Government are giving those assurances, I welcome that. Jeff J Mitchell/PA Wire Tony Blair \n“I should imagine they gave strong assurances about the car industry’s access to the single market. If this is an indication that the UK government are giving strong assurances about access to the single market, this would be important,” he told BBC Radio Four’s Today programme. \nAs controversy over allegations of a secret deal continued to swirl, Labour chairman of the Commons Business Committee Iain Wright, the MP for Hartlepool, insisted Business Secretary Greg Clark must appear before the watchdog to give evidence on the matter.

I don’t have a chequebook. \n“The important thing is that they know this is a country in which they can have confidence they can invest. That was the assurance and the understanding they had, and they have invested their money.” Business Secretary Greg Clark \nMr Wright told the BBC: “On the one hand, it’s taxpayers’ money, and, I think, we would need to know. And, on the other, it could be commercial confidence as well. But, in terms of transparency, in respect of how government will intervene and provide that reassurance and support, I do think that’s important.” \nThe Japanese giant’s decision to build its next-generation Qashqai, and add production of the new X-Trail model, at its Sunderland plant was seized on by Prime Minister Theresa May as proof that the UK was an attractive investment hub despite the flux caused by the Brexit vote.

Colin Lawther, Nissan’s European senior vice president for manufacturing \n“No, there is no offer of exchange. It’s just the commitment from the Government to work with the whole of the automotive industry to make sure that the whole automotive industry in the UK remains competitive,” he said. \nAsked if Nissan had received written assurances from the Government on what would happen if tariffs were imposed in the future, he said: “There’s nothing, there’s no special deal for Nissan. We are working within the whole of the automotive industry. We would expect nothing for us that the rest of the industry wouldn’t be able to have access to.” \nShadow chancellor John McDonnell warned that “secret deals behind closed doors” would damage business confidence in the UK. \n“It’s utterly chaotic at the moment. We have got a situation where we get leaks and rumours. Are they now going to decide, literally, factory by factory the support they are going to give?” \nNissan boss Carlos Ghosn went to Downing Street earlier this month for crunch talks with the Prime Minister. \nHe said the manufacturer could make the production decision due to “support and assurances” from the Government.
