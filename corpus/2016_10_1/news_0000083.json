Shops then have a choice between accepting a cut in their profits or passing the extra cost on to the public by putting up prices. \nTesco has responded to Unilever’s attempt to put up prices by 10 per cent by simply refusing to restock its products. They range from Marmite and Hellman’s, to Flora, Domestos and Surf. \nMs McKinnell said: “Regardless of how anyone voted, the volatility in the pound since the referendum has been extremely concerning, and this situation is a real-life example of what continued Brexit uncertainty could mean for people’s everyday lives. \n“The Government seriously needs to get a grip on this issue, and actually set out what its Brexit strategy and objectives are. Instead, we have vague waffle from Ministers who don’t appear to have the first idea about how they are going to deal with the hugely complex task ahead of us.” \nOther big supermarkets - including Asda and Sainsbury’s - appear to be stocking all 42 Unilever brands as normal.

However, any firms which buy supplies or services from foreign firms as part of the manufacturing process will also see their costs increase. \nIt is thought a number of supermarkets are embroiled in the row with Unilever, which earlier this year posted profits of around £2 billion for the first half of 2016. Unilever/PA Wire Unilever logo \nUnilever refused to comment on the dispute, but chief executive Paul Polman warned in June that a vote to leave the EU’s single market would increase prices for consumers. \nHe told Channel 4 that a vote to Leave would mean hikes in import duties on items such as dairy products, leading to price rises that would affect consumers. \nCiting the example of Wall’s Magnum ice cream, Mr Polman warned about trade restrictions, saying: “Undoubtedly if the UK were to Leave, the conditions will not be as good as if they stay in.” \nSome MPs have condemned Unilever, saying the company was using Brexit as an excuse to exploit consumers, and warned it may be damaging its brand. \nConservative MP Sir Gerald Howarth told the Daily Telegraph: “I think it will be very damaging to the reputation of Unilever if they seek to use the fall in the pound to exploit the consumer. Nick Potts/PA Wire A Pot Noodle, made by Unilever \n“Clearly products which are not dependent upon imports into the United Kingdom will not be affected by the fall in the value of the pound. \n“Consumers will switch to other products where companies aren’t seeking to fleece the consumer.” \nLiberal Democrat leader Tim Farron blamed the Government, saying: “The chaos around Brexit is now hitting our supermarket shelves. This shows the Government don’t have a plan or even a clue.” \nThe dispute came on a tumultuous day for the pound on the foreign exchanges, which at one point saw sterling lose almost 1% of it value against the dollar during the course of exchanges in the House of Commons, before staging a rally.
