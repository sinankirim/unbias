Is it really because of Brexit? \nStrangely enough, it actually is. \nUnilever is believed to have stopped their deliveries to Tesco, after the supermarket giants refused to agree to their plans to raise prices by 10% due to the falling value of the pound against the euro and dollar. \nSince Britain voted to leave the EU, the value of the pound has dropped by an average of 17%. So does this mean no more Marmite? \nFor the half of you who love Marmite, the good news is you’re still able to buy the stuff. \nTesco shoppers will still be able to pick up Unilever products in stores, although stock levels are said to be running low. \nRival supermarkets such as Asda and Sainsburys all currently appear to be stocking the items as normal. What has Tesco said? \nA Tesco spokesperson said: “We are currently experiencing availability issues on a number of Unilever products. We hope to have this issue resolved soon.” What has Unilever said?", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-10-13T17:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-10-13T13:34:17.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
