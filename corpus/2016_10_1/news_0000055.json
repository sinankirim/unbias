This. Space boutique, in Leicester city centre, and Just Hype, of Wigston, have all been nominated for the Young Business Executive category. \nThe awards, which take place on Thursday, November 3 at the King Power Stadium, are a chance for people to celebrate their successes over the past year and also meet other members of the business community. \nSnooks, run by Susie Beere and Sophie Kelly, was set up in October 2014 after the keen snowboarders couldn't find any suitable women's ski wear. \nThe pair have won a space in Loughborough University's prestigious innovation centre The Studio for two terms. \nThey have also been named as finalists in the Baldwins KickStart awards, which could see them win a £10,000 grant and £10,000 worth of mentoring and accountancy advice, and won the New Business Award at the Leicestershire Women in Business Awards. \nWatch. This. Space founder and designer Stephanie MacDonald-Walker, who also runs SM Walker, reached the final of the Midlands Fashion Awards (MFA) this year. \nStephanie set up the fashion boutique in St Martins three years ago to raise awareness of county designers and help bring their products to the high street. She now stocks brands from all over the country and also uses the space as a gallery for designers. \nStephanie often lets designers sell their products in her shop for a month or so, and will then give them feedback about how well they've sold and what the public thinks of their products. \nJust Hype clothing, which was launched in 2012 with a £3,000 investment, has slowly but surely taken the fashion world by storm. \nThe business is famed for its simple lifestyle clothing such as T-shirts, jumpers, hats and flip-flops. \nFans of Just Hype include Jay Z, Jack Garratt, Idris Elba and Cara Delevigne. \nRecent successes include collaborations with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Spongebob, Barbie and Pokémon. \nEarlier this year, the business, which is run by Liam Green, Bav Samani and Vin Patel, relocated to a 25,000 sq ft space in Wigston. \nIt now employs more than 60 members of staff in Wigston, London and Taiwan. \nThe Young Business Executive award is being sponsored by investment management company Quilter Cheviot. \nTim Horrocks, head of Quilter Cheviot's Leicester office, said: \"Leicester is home to an ambitious community of young professional talent and if the city is to continue to thrive, young businesspeople will be essential in ensuring we make a success of the opportunities in a post-Brexit climate. \n\"Previous recipients of the award have gone on to achieve great success. \n\"By acknowledging the success of these individuals, we hope it will inspire others to follow in their footsteps. \n\"Quilter Cheviot is dedicated to supporting future talent, reflected through its apprenticeship scheme, which provides young people with the opportunity to develop the skills and knowledge needed for a prosperous career in the wealth management industry.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-10-25T18:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-10-25T14:22:24.670+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
