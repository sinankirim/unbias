It is one of the world’s most visited attractions. \nBut go on the Prado website and you will find prominence given to its new partnership with a town in County Durham – or at least the Auckland Castle Trust. John A Clarke Jonathan Ruffer at Auckland Castle \nThe two organisations have come together to help to establish a centre of excellence for Spanish art, heritage and culture that will include a fellowship programme and a range of projects at the Trust’s Spanish Art Gallery which is due to open in 2019. \nThe deal was signed at a ceremony in Madrid. \nJonathan Ruffer, multi-millionaire philanthropist, art collector and chairman of Auckland Castle Trust, addressed the president of the Prado, José Pedro Pérez-Llorca, with reference to the possible effects of Brexit. \nHe said: “The fabric which once held Europe and Britain together is now under threat, with no-one knowing quite how events will play out. \n“This small act of union between Auckland Castle Trust and the Museo del Prado is a powerful one and will set an international precedent for pan-European collaboration, demonstrating the immense benefits of continuing to pool our international resources, experience and expertise. Museo Nacional del Prado The Museo Nacional del Prado in Madrid \n“Together we plan to contextualise Auckland Castle Trust’s collections and bring greater understanding and merit to the genre of Spanish art and culture as whole. \n“The potential for this project is unprecedented and I am certain it will play a key role in putting Bishop Auckland and County Durham firmly on the international map.” \nWhat will both parties get out of the arrangement? \nThe Museo del Prado will collaborate with the Trust on mounting exhibitions in the new Spanish Art Gallery. \nAuckland Castle Trust, meanwhile, will finance the Museo del Prado/Auckland Castle Fellowship, based in Madrid, which will allow for the development of projects common to both organisations. \nThis arrangement will last initially for a year but with the option to extend it for up to three. \nWhile the Prado has a massive and priceless collection , County Durham has one of Britain’s most important collections of Spanish art. \nAs well as the portrait series Jacob and his Twelve Sons by Francisco de Zurbur \nán, which has hung at Auckland Castle for some 200 years, there are notable works at the Bowes Museum, at Raby Castle and at Durham Cathedral and Castle. \nThe new partnership follows confirmation that Auckland Castle Trust is also partnering with Durham University to launch the Zurbaran Centre for Spanish and Latin American Art which is due to open in 2017. \nBoth these are part of the Trust’s £70m initiative designed to stimulate economic regeneration in Bishop Auckland.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-10-11T21:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-10-11T16:27:27.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
