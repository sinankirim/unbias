And in 2014 Vertu Motors overtook Sage Group to clinch fourth place on the list, where it remained last year. So all four top places have been won through cars and public transport. \nIt’s a contrast to when engineering, through Northern Engineering and NEI Gosforth, filled number one for 12 years in a row. Those were also the first years (from 1978) of the table being compiled. \nBut Nissan, the UK’s largest car manufacturing plant, has now topped the table seven times in all. And if it’s still on top this time around it will equal Procter & Gamble’s achievement of eight number ones in previous years, when the manufacturer of personal and household care products qualified for consideration. \nFrom an initial workforce of fewer than 500 building 5,000 cars a year Nissan now employs 7,000 (plus 40,000 indirectly in its supply chain) producing more than 500,000 vehicles annually - around a third of the UK’s entire automotive production. \nBeyond interest in seeing whether Nissan still rules the North East roost lies anxiety too, not altogether allayed yet. Will the Sunderland operation continue to excel, or even sustain its present success, once Brexit takes effect, with new trading and customs arrangements in Europe for British manufacturers? \nAn upgraded Qashqai will go ahead in Sunderland next year, with a semi-autonomous driving element for the first time. But with bidding to build a new 2020 Qashqai pencilled in for year-end 2017 or early 2018, and doubts whether UK trading arrangements with the EU will be settled by then, some worries remain that this project might go to a sibling plant on the Continent. \nIt is encouraging for Sunderland that Nissan’s global supremo Carlos Ghosn, having now met British Prime Minister Theresa May, expresses confidence that “the UK will remain a competitive place to do business in”, and that he looks forward to continuing “positive collaboration between Nissan and the UK Government.” \nNissan’s turnover was £1.8bn when it first topped the North East Top 200 table in 2000. On the present table soon to be updated it stands at £5.3bn. If Mr Ghosn’s confidence proves justified, Nissan could be setting a hot pace again - not only when the new table appears exclusively in The Journal and The Gazette on November 16 but for some time yet. Nissan/PA Wire Nissan How the table is compiled \nThe Top 200 table is compiled from publicly available sources by PwC in Newcastle. All information comes from published audited accounts of companies filed at Companies House, or available on the company website. Companies in the list are ranked in order of latest turnover. \nCompanies are identified as having a registered office address in the region (i.e. the postcode area is one of the following; NE, SR, DH, DL or TS). Deadline for inclusion for this year is October 24 Join the award winners \nA Top 200 awards presentation breakfast, open to all, will be held at the Stadium of Light, Sunderland, on November 15 (7.30am-10.30am approximately). Guests will receive their copy of the Top 200 supplement a day ahead of general publication. \nFor table and ticket bookings, or for opportunities to sponsor, contact Amy Evans, events manager, T: 0191 201 6092 E: amy.evans@trinitymirror.com \nSponsors of the Top 200 include the North East England Chamber of Commerce (associate), PwC (research), Durham University Business School (support), North East Business & Innovation Centre (highest new entry), Sintons (privately owned category), and Sunderland College (the number one company). Boosting businesses \nSunderland College, which is sponsoring the top company award this year, operates from four main campuses across the city. \nIt trains and educates school leavers, adults, employers. EMSI, an economic modelling specialist, has highlighted that the college’s economic contribution to the North East business community is £444.5m yearly. \nThe college provides employer training in a growing number of market sectors, including advanced manufacture and engineering; digital and media; health and care; construction (incorporating sustainable construction and renewable energy); and professional business services. It works with more than 400 businesses, and is one of the region’s largest provider of apprenticeship training.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-10-18T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-10-17T20:22:12.751+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
