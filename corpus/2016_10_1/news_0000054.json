If there was a car in its blind spot it happily waited. \nAnd when Amy failed to take back control after it asked her to, it worked out something was wrong and came to a gradual halt. \nIt the real world, it would even have called 999 to tell them there was a potential emergency – no less than you might expect if it had been the hard shoulder of the M1. \nThe technology worked and it needs to because within a year these cars, or ones very similar, will be tested on the streets of Coventry and Milton Keynes. \nOPINION: The Brexit rollercoaster rattles on \nA lot of the safety elements of driverless cars are already there – cameras, wireless technology, clever computer, algorithms, radar systems, you name it. \nOne of the next big steps – and one of the big points of media days like this and the future real world trials – is getting the message out there that the technology is safe. \nIf the cars on display at this south Leicestershire test track were anything to go by, that might not be half as difficult as you might imagine.
