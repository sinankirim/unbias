The Northern Powerhouse initiative has now had the backing of Theresa May and other senior MPs and it’s vital the Government refocuses its efforts in this area and ensures economic prosperity is shared fairly.” Read More Tackling gender pay gap could boost economy by billions of pounds, report says \nIrwin Mitchell produced its first UK Powerhouse report last year, which report predicted a growing economic gap between the South East and the North of England. \nThe report made nine policy recommendations in a call for the Government to radically rethink how it looks to rebalance the UK’s economy. Among the recommendations was the establishment of more industry clusters around UK universities, the introduction of a regional living wage and the devolution of air passenger duty to English regions. \nOutput in Britain’s manufacturing sector reached its highest level for more than two years as the industry continued to bounce back from a post-Brexit vote slump. Figures for the services sector also showed a recovery after a shock contraction after the Brexit vote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-10-05T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-10-05T16:56:44.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
