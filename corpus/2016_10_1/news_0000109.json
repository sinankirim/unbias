Brexit must not be put at risk in the years and decades ahead.” Stefan Rousseau/PA \nBut it was dismissed as “completely mad” by the council’s Conservative leader, Paul Spooner - who announced Coun Holliday had been suspended from the Conservative group. \nAsked about the petition, Prime Minister Theresa May’s official spokeswoman said: “Different people will choose their words differently. \n“The Prime Minister has been very clear that the British people have made their decision and we should respect the will of the British people. That’s how she would put it.” Read More Marmite and ice cream - how Brexit is already changing our lives \nBut Liberal Democrats said that Mrs May should make clear she does not approve of the petition. \n“It’s bad enough that a Conservative councillor is trying to shut down any democratic debate about Brexit as treason, but it’s downright frightening that the Prime Minister has so far refused to condemn him,” said Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman Tom Brake. \n“People did not vote to turn back the clock to medieval Britain. The Lib Dems will be the real voice of opposition and fight against a reckless Brexit that takes us out of the single market.” Prime Minister Theresa May \nThe petition is so far well short of the 10,000 required for the Government to respond or the 100,000 needed for the proposal to be debated in Parliament. \nIt can be signed on the official Parliamentary petitions website, at https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/168882. \nThe website also reveals how many people have so far signed it in each part of the country, and so far 197 people in the North East region have signed up. \nMeanwhile, a Brexit Minister has confirmed there are “no current plans” for a new British independence day on June 23, to mark the EU referendum vote.

Unfortunately it’s just too costly, in the view of the Department for Business, Energy and the Industrial Strategy, to introduce another holiday at this stage. \n“When they analysed the impact of the additional holiday for the Diamond Jubilee, they found that it cost employers over £1 billion.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-10-19T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-10-18T20:22:09.091+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
