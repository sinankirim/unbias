We look forward to building on our success.” \nCommenting on the impact of Brexit, Mr Matthews added: “Brexit has caused uncertainty but as a large percentage of Nifco UK business is exported, either directly or indirectly, the weakness in the pound is currently helping exports - which may well underpin our £75m growth target.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-10-05T18:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-10-05T14:42:26.254+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
