The Journal meets him. \nFilm buffs of a certain vintage may remember the 1980s Richard Pryor classic Brewster’s Millions. \nThe premise was simple: Monty Brewster, a minor league baseball pitcher, is offered the chance to inherit $300m, but only if he can spend $30m in 30 days and not have a single penny or asset at the end of it. \nThe North East Business Support Fund, part funded by the European Regional Development Fund, may not have access to £300m or even £30m come to that, but the clock is ticking on a pot of money that will hopefully help create a few millionaires, or at least empower firms to grow and realise their potential – however vast that may be. \nAnd while for many businesses the fund provides the springboard to jump to the next level, for John King of NBSL, the enterprise agency managing the programme, it also provides an important access point for a wealth of business support. \n“The landscape for business support has changed dramatically in the last few years,” he said. \n“The reorganisation of the regional Business Link, the abolition of the regional development agencies, the rise in prominence of the Local Enterprise Partnerships – it is easy to see why there may be confusion around what help is out there for someone wanting to grow their business. \n“In reality, there is a great deal. And an application for NEBSF funding does not just gain a business access to a pot of cash for a single project, it opens a door to a support network designed and delivered exclusively to make sure North East Businesses succeed.” \nIt is helping businesses succeed that has stoked Mr King’s professional passions for over two decades. John King, North East Business Support Manager at NBSL \nFrom training development to workforce development, project oversight to funding provider – his entire career has seen him dedicate himself to empowering and enabling businesses. \nHowever, the rather sedate environment of Wansbeck Business Park on the outskirts of Ashington is a far cry from where he started out, travelling the world and dodging stray bullets. \n“I began at a training and development consultancy and it was fantastic,” said Mr King, 43. \n“We had huge, global brands like Barclays as clients and we travelled all over the world to help to develop and deliver their training programmes. \n“One of more interesting assignments saw us in Harare, working for Barclays during a period of incredible unrest in Zimbabwe in the early 2000s. There were issues with student protests, public strikes, white landowners were having their property and assets seized without warning - it was chaos. We were literally being escorted by armed guards from our hotel to the client and then back again. All very exciting at the time, but in the back of my mind, I knew it was time to move on.” \nMr King, who hails from Bishop Auckland and was educated at St Leonard’s School in Durham , felt the pull of the North East and returned home to become workforce development manager at Business Link Tyne and Wear before moving on to the now defunct regional development agency One North East, where he spent six years project managing a suite of business support projects and programmes. \nIn 2012, he moved to NBSL with a determination to put his extensive experience of business funding and contacts within the European Development Fund to good use and create a pot of money that could be accessed quickly with minimum fuss and deliver real impact within new and small companies. \n“It’s a cliche, but I genuinely want to play my part in helping the North East realise its potential. We have so many excellent innovators, entrepreneurs and brilliant SMEs that may never manage to make that leap from being a smashing little company with a great product or idea to becoming the region’s next Sage, Greggs or KPMG. \n“You can see the difference the funding makes – businesses can be transformed by tapping into support and pushing ahead with projects they may otherwise never have had the opportunity to complete. \n“Having worked across the industry for so long, I appreciate that there is a misconception that accessing support is bureaucratic,” said Mr King. \n“People think that they will face reams of paperwork, spend hours poring over clauses and sub-clauses, face interviews and assessments and then at the end of it all, be refused funding. \n“What we take great pride in doing is removing that headache from the businesses bidding for funding. We have created a streamlined, easy to understand, agile fund that can be accessed quickly by almost any SME in the North East Local Enterprise Partnership area.” \nA key focus of NBSL will fall on County Durham, an area with high deprivation levels and historically low levels of business start-up. \nThe last iteration of the Business Support Fund, a two-and-a-half year programme that ran until August 2015, approved investment of £2.5m, funding projects in 2,500 businesses, and has already created 650 jobs whilst safeguarding countless others. \nThe new scheme allows businesses to access up to 35% funding towards projects costing between £3,000 and £8,000, with a maximum grant of £2,800. \nGeographically, any business in the North East Local Enterprise Partnership (NELEP) area of County Durham, Northumberland and Tyne and Wear can bid for the funding. \nThe money can be used for most forms of external expertise from business growth planning, marketing, strategy development, change management, expansion planning, developing quality management systems, product development, accessing new markets, design costs – literally hundreds of project types can be supported.

We will work it to meet the needs of the business – that’s where our expertise comes in. Our team is set up to make sure that our clients receive the maximum amount of funding and that it delivers the maximum impact. \n“We have just over 18 months left of this project and the entire NBSL team is working incredibly hard to ensure that at the end of the programme, every penny has been invested in North East companies to help them succeed.” \nSo, with the money coming from the European Regional Development Fund, how is it impacted by the referendum result and impending Brexit? \nMr King is relaxed about it, and is very quick to point out that the UK leaving the European Union does not mean the end of business support grants and financial support. \n“We are very careful not to add to the general confusion surrounding Brexit,” he said. \n“But what I can say is that we have a fund in place that stretches into 2018. With the Prime Minister pledging to begin the Brexit process before March of next year, there is enough time for the Government to make sure replacement and/or alternative programmes are in place to pick up where the European funding ends.

So long as there is no lag between the end of European support and the start of whatever replaces it, any negative impact will be minimised.” \nNBSL, which was created in 2001 and during its history has been part of the Business Link programme and then back to being an independent Enterprise Agency, employs 22 people and is part of a substantial network of organisations created to stimulate private sector growth. \n“We work in closely with the Local Enterprise Partnership and are very supportive of the North East Growth Hub. We are partnered with several colleges, work alongside training providers and have a great relationship with other funding organisations in the area. \n“When someone walks through our door looking for grant support, they are plugging into a network that provides support for every element of their business. If we do not do it, we will help them find someone who does – if you are a small or medium business, give us a call. \n“You have nothing to lose, but everything to gain.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-10-16T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-10-16T15:23:17.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
