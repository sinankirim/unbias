Hilary Armstrong, Labour's chief whip at the launch of the Labour Party's local election campaign \nCommittee members said there is “too much at stake” for the Government to begin negotiations about leaving the EU without consulting members of Parliament at all. \nMeanwhile, Brexit Secretary David Davis has admitted businesses face a damaging “cliff edge” if the Government misses its two-year deadline for striking a fresh EU trade deal. \nHe agreed with an MP who said businesses would suffer if agreement could not be reached by March 2019. \nTheresa May, the Prime Minister , has announced the UK will trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, the formal mechanism for leaving the EU, by the end of March next year. \nIt will mark the start of formal negotiations about Brexit, and the process is meant to last within two years. \nBut if no new trade deal is agreed, the UK and EU could fall back on default trade rules agreed by the World Trade Organisation - which would allow trade between UK businesses and the EU to continue, but could mean that firms have to pay a tariff on exports. \nQuizzing the Brexit Secretary, Labour MP Emma Reynolds said: “Our European partners have so far refused to say that they will enter trade talks alongside our article 50 negotiations. What will the Government and the Secretary of State do to avoid the cliff edge in March 2019, when we leave the EU, of our falling out of the EU single market and back on World Trade Organisation rules?” Video loading Click to play Tap to play The Live Event you are trying to watch is either unavailable or has not started Please refresh this page in your browser to reload this live event video \nHe told her that negotiations would take place, adding: “That is what we will have because, as she quite rightly says, we need to conclude them within two years to avoid any cliff edge.” \nEarlier this month, business leaders including the CBI and manufacturers’ body the EEF wrote an open letter to Ministers calling for barrier-free trade with Europe to be preserved. \nThey warned: “Falling into World Trade Organisation rules in only 29 months from now, which is the prospective timetable, would mean up to 90 per cent of goods could potentially have tariffs on them.” \nMr Davis also has accused Labour of damaging the national interest by pressing the Government to reveal more about its Brexit negotiating strategy.
