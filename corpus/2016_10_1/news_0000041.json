But it will also incorporate all existing EU law into UK law. \nAnd Brexit-supporting MPs are reportedly planning to attach a “sunset clause” under which the EU-made laws within the bill would stop being in force after five years. \nBut Mrs Trevelyan said she backed the Prime Minister’s approach. \nShe said: “I think it’s a very sensible way to move forward as part of the Brexit programme. \n“For me, the repeal of the 1972 Act is the critical starting point. \n“In so doing, you have to make sure that in the short term you don’t leave any legal gaps. So bringing in all EU law into EU law is the way to ensure that. \n“And then we can, in a measured state of calm over several years and in negotiations with all those who are affected by them, remove any which are no longer required for a free and independent Great Britain.” \nMrs May has offered to involve Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in regular formal talks on the Brexit process in an effort to quell concern about her handling of the situation. \nDowning Street said Mrs May will tell the leaders of the devolved administrations concerned about a possible hard Brexit that final decisions about her approach had not yet been taken and “how the UK leaves the EU will not boil down to a binary choice”. \nMrs May will come under pressure from Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Welsh counterpart Carwyn Jones and Northern Ireland’s leader Arlene Foster and her deputy Martin McGuinness at a meeting in Downing Street. Conservative MP for Berwick Anne-Marie Trevelyan \nThe devolved administrations are keen to secure continued participation in the single market and want to hold votes on Mrs May’s approach before she triggers Article 50, formally beginning the Brexit process. \nThe Prime Minister has offered them a “direct line” to Brexit Secretary David Davis, who will chair a new forum bringing together representatives from Westminster, Holyrood, Cardiff Bay and Stormont for regular talks on the situation. \nBut there is no sign of a voice for the English regions, despite demands that the needs of the North East must be considered in talks. \nThink tank IPPR North has said the region needs what it called a Northern Brexit Negotiating Committee, including the North’s leading politicians, top business people, exporters, importers and innovators, and key public service leaders. to advise the government on Brexit. \nAnd Paul Watson, chair of the North East Combined Authority and leader of Sunderland City Council, said earlier this year that the north of England had as much right to be consulted as Scotland. \nHe was one of a number of northern leaders to write to Mrs May demanding a place at the Brexit negotiating table.
