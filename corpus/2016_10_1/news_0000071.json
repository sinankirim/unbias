Gareth Fuller/PA Wire A view of he jungle migrant camp in Calais, France \n“Neutrality is so important but when you read such anti-Tory rhetoric from a well known local reporter, it does nothing to heal the preconceptions about BBC bias that many in politics have,” he raged or fumed or whatever. \nNige’s comments I saw were quoted in the last bastion of news objectivity and neutrality The Sun. \nAbout the same time it was passing judgement on Mr Carpenter’s personal opinion, the Sun on its news pages published a story based on a facial recognition app it said revealed child immigrants to be around 100 years old. \nSome members of the public put the same app to the test themselves and came up with altogether different results. \nOne, a man in his 20s, used it on himself only for the app to decide he was in his 50s. Someone tried it on a pic of a 17-year-old Wayne Rooney which said he was 27. \nBy chance, and also last week, it was decided that Sun columnist Kelvin Mackenzie was OK to express his moral outrage at Channel 4 for having a Muslim member of staff wearing a hijab front the news on the day of the Nice lorry attack. \nApparently it’s to do with freedom of speech - which allows you to insult people. Insult a certain type of person, it seems. \nFor my part I did think calling the Tories the ‘new Nazis’ was wrong, not because of the sensibilities of Enoch Rudd and her ilk, but out of respect for the million of Jews, Soviet POWs, ethnic Poles, Serbs, Roma, the Disabled, Freemasons, Slavs, Homosexuals, Jehovah’s Witnesses and Spanish Republicans who died in the Holocaust. \nYou completely lose perspective on their suffering by using the ‘Nazi’ tag in this context. \nHowever, with all the right wing anti-immigrant bile passing as news content these days, perhaps it is time to re-visit that dark moment in history to remind ourselves of how and why it happened in the first place.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-10-22T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-10-22T15:12:09.237+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
