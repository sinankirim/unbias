Nissan/PA Wire Nissan \nDowning Street has insisted there was “no compensation package” and “nothing about tariffs” in the assurances the Government gave to the car manufacturer. \nBut former business minster Anna Soubry, who held initial post-Brexit discussions with Nissan while in government, said she would be “very surprised” if there was no guarantee to mitigate tariffs. \nThe Remain-backing Tory MP said she met Nissan on June 30, a week after the Brexit vote, and that the company expressed “profound concerns” about tariffs. \nShe said: “They didn’t give the detail of what they wanted, they made it very clear that without a guarantee that they would not be subject to tariffs or if they were subject to tariffs the Government would do something to mitigate the damage of tariffs... that without that, they told me, my understanding actually was that they would go to Renault because they clearly had the capacity there.” \nAs controversy over allegations of a secret deal continued to swirl, Labour chairman of the Commons Business Committee Iain Wright, the MP for Hartlepool, insisted Business Secretary Greg Clark should appear before the watchdog to give evidence on the matter. Greg Clark \nMr Clark has insisted the deal rests on “a very strong mutual confidence” and stressed “there’s no chequebook”, while Nissan has also denied there was a special agreement. \nBut Labour has urged the Government to set out exactly what it told Nissan. \nShadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: “It’s welcome that the Government have done a deal with Nissan that protects jobs and supports the local community and economy. \n“But that deal needs to be accompanied by transparency and accountability. \n“We can’t have the Government doing deals that affect jobs and the future of our economy without telling the public or Parliament what the basic terms are. \n“They now need to spell that out and strike a wider deal that gives certainty to businesses, workers and communities across the country.” \nMeanwhile, former Liberal Democrat Leader Paddy Ashdown called on the Government to support other key businesses across the UK in the same way it helped Nissan. \nHe said: “It’s important the Government has stepped in to support Nissan and protect jobs. \n“But if they are willing to step in and support making cars in Sunderland, why won’t they do the same for those making helicopters in Yeovil? It’s crucial that a strategy is put in place immediately to secure jobs across the country and across sectors, including our strategically vital aerospace industry.” Nissan jobs boost", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-10-28T23:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-10-28T19:27:09.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
