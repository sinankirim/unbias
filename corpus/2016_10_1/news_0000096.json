Worryingly we know that hate crime is vastly under-reported.” \nMany fear the problem is going to get worse and avoid reporting hate crime, Miss Pidcock said. \nShe added: “There are many pressures on those who are targeted, and they may fear things getting worse. Some people are also fearful of the repercussions if they report what happened.” County Durham and Darlington’s Police Crime Commissioner, Ron Hogg \nCounty Durham and Darlington’s Police Crime Commissioner, Ron Hogg, has put a new advocacy service in place as part of his pledge to put the victims of crime first. \nShow Racism the Red Card, Darlington Association on Disability and Gay Advice Darlington and Durham will work together as part of the scheme to support anyone suffering from hate crime, or possible hate crime, throughout the criminal justice process. \nIt is hoped that with more support in place victims of hate crime would be more likely to come forward.
