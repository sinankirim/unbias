British people panic buying #Marmite perfectly sums up the hysterical insanity of 2016. #Marmitegate #Brexit pic.twitter.com/Yt0DS4TkLY — Tom King (@tallgeekychap) 13 October 2016 \nFirst Killer Clowns, then Marmite? We dread to think what’s coming next! Pretty sure Marmite famine and rampaging Killer Clowns are both in the Book of Revelation as signs of the End Times. — Sinister Farce (@twlldun) 13 October 2016 \nA reaction it seems many share following the news. When you realise @tesco have stopped selling marmite. #marmitegate pic.twitter.com/1E8nsJKIDp — Sarah Dean (@sarahdeancomms) 13 October 2016 \nFor some though, #Marmitegate is only touches the surface of the problem. @MartinShovel Daddies Brown Sauce is where I make my stand. #Marmitegate — Linda Mockett (@mframeg) 13 October 2016 \nIs this the first casualty of the stand-off between Tesco and Unilever? NO MORE PG TIPS? — Ken Shabby (@MrKenShabby) 12 October 2016 \nThat is a hefty amount of Marmite to just be giving away in the current climate. Left the waiter a serious tip. pic.twitter.com/wnMK95oJoy — Jason Hazeley (@JasonHazeley) 13 October 2016 \nWe’re sure this was the discussion Viggo Mortensen was having with his on-screen son in the post-apocalypse movie The Road... \"What did Marmite taste like father?\" pic.twitter.com/Uai8JwS5z0 — Zorro P Freely (@banalyst) 12 October 2016 \nThe timing surely isn’t a coincidence. Wow. Scottish people really, really love Marmite https://t.co/sccS1qQzH5 \nThe jokes firmly on us now for not believing. Today I was MOCKED for keeping an emergency Marmite supply in my handbag. Two words. APOCALYPSE. READY. — Sybil Disobedience (@PaolaOeste) 12 October 2016 \nSomebody’s clearly hit the jackpot. — Dave Williams (@realdavedoubleu) 13 October 2016 \nWe really wouldn’t recommend this... Just scored two jars of Marmite from a bloke in the park. Keith — Keith Mallender (@KeithMallender) 13 October 2016 \nIs this the first signs of a crimewave following the news of #Marmageddon? Beware the Marmite touts outside Tesco. Links to organised crime, Bovril trafficking etc. — Simon Blackwell (@simonblackwell) 13 October 2016 \nDespite the great pressure we’re now all under, there are some calls to remain calm. Good people of Britain. No matter how terrible this Marmite war becomes, we must not go to the dark side Vegemite #marmite #Marmitegate — Ben Fogle (@Benfogle) 13 October 2016 \nIn the midst of the hysteria, it is good to consider a little perspective. Our grandparents withstood bombing raids and rationing to protect our freedom. We are screeching about 10p on a jar of #Marmite . — Jamie Foster (@1jamiefoster) 13 October 2016 \nWas this the deal that cost Sam Allardyce his job as England manager? \"I can get you Marmite...but it's gonna cost you\" pic.twitter.com/54hn2zhXWr \nAnd even our very own Gateshead MP Ian Mearns has joined in on the fun.
