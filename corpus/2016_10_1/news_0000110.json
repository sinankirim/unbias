Have your say \nThe organiser of an English Defence League demonstration set to take place in Boston this Saturday, has promised the event will be a peaceful one. \nThe EDL announced its plans for the demonstration - which coincides with Lincolnshire Day - earlier this month saying it was ‘against rising immigration’ and for the Government to ‘invoke Article 50’ - which would trigger the UK’s officially withdrawal from the European Union. \nSince the announcement, a number of people have contacted The Standard expressing concerns. \nHowever, EDL lead for Lincolnshire Paul Whiteside has told The Standard that he will not tolerate ‘any trouble’ during the event. \nHe said: “It is planned as a peaceful demonstration. \n“It should not cause any disruption to shoppers.” \nHe added that he was very aware that he had organised it and it would ‘come back on me’ if there was any trouble. \nMr Whiteside said he had a good relationship with police and did not want anything to spoil that. \nHe added: “This is not an attack on Polish or Russian communities or anybody that lives in Boston. \n“We want Brexit and we want to implement a points system so if there’s jobs in the UK that we can’t fill, then people from abroad get the opportunity to come in.” \nHe added that he believed recent protests by the EDL had not resulted in violence from the party’s side. \nThe demonstration will start at the St George’s Road car park at 12 noon - marching at 1pm. It will then take the main roads through the Market Place to the War Memorial where there will be a number of speeches. \nEarlier this year, Boston voted ‘out’ in the European Union Referendum with the leave campaign taking 75.6 per cent of the vote – the highest in the country. \nMr Whiteside said this was why Boston had been chosen as the place to demonstrate.
