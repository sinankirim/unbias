The Prime Minister’s words from 2003 will come back to haunt her.” \nBut speaking at Prime Minister’s Questions, Mrs May said the Government would act as quickly as possible. \nShe said: “This is a subject that has been debated, discussed, speculated on for 40 years. This Government will take a decision. \n“But there is then a formal process that has to be undertaken so that the Government will identify its preferred option of site. That will then go to a statutory consultation. \n“The Government will then consider the results of the statutory consultation and bring forward an airports national planning statement on which this House will vote.” \nThe Davies Commission recommended a third runway at Heathrow, but Mrs May stressed that the other two options in the report were “credible and deliverable”. \nIn a letter to ministers, Mrs May said colleagues with long-standing views or constituency interests on the issue would be given an “exceptional and limited” freedom to criticise the decision of the Cabinet’s airports sub-committee, though they will not be allowed to campaign against it or call into question the process by which it was reached. \nThe letter also confirmed that the decision would be put to the House of Commons for a vote in the winter of 2017/18. \nThe choice on the Government’s preferred option will be made not by the full Cabinet but by the airports sub-committee - which does not include Mr Johnson, Ms Greening or any other London MPs. \nArlen Pettit, policy adviser at the North East England Chamber of Commerce, said: “It is good news that we look likely to get an indication of the Government’s preferred option for airport expansion next week, sending an important message to businesses about their future connectivity to markets around the world. \n“This is a vital infrastructure project for the whole of the UK, and it is only right that the Government’s decision looks set to be followed by the proper statutory process.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-10-20T00:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-10-19T19:56:23.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
