We should also benefit from weaker comparatives. \n\"We continue to focus on our key initiatives whilst ensuring we maintain our unique offer of tremendous value for money, combined with an unrivalled range and great service.\" \nRuss Mould, investment director at investment company AJ Bell, said Dunelm was the FTSE 250's biggest faller today, down more than 4.6 per cent by lunchtime. \nHe said: \"The hot spell reduced footfall at its out-of-town superstores but the group continues to see good growth in its online business. \n\"Dunelm will be looking forward to a stronger second quarter as it continues to invest in extra seasonal space, new till systems, store refits and new store openings and it should also benefit from weaker comparatives.\" \nDunelm said stores which had been open longer than a year contributed £173.9 million in revenue, while home deliveries brought in £13.6 million – compared to £11.5 million in the same period last year. New stores brought in £11.2 million. \nThe first quarter trading update said: \"Gross margin is estimated to be broadly flat when compared to the equivalent quarter last year. \n\"As yet we have not seen any material impact from adverse foreign exchange markets in relation to goods sourced directly or from third parties.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-10-06T19:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-10-06T15:35:43.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
