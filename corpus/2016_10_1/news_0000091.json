A British Airways plane taking off from Heathrow Airport \nSpeaking about the Heathrow study, Professor Rod Jones from the University of Cambridge told the BBC: “If there is the development of a third runway, we expect there to be a marginal increase in NO2 coming from the airport itself, but that would be against the background of reduced NO2 from other traffic, because of Euro 6 engines and electrification of the traffic fleet.” \nHe added: “By deploying a network of sensors we can tell directly from the measurements, what’s been emitted locally from Heathrow airport and what’s been blown in, mostly from central London. That’s the real strength of the sensor network. \n“The major result from this study is that we have tested the models far more critically than you can from a single measurement site.” 08:15 Kathryn Riddell Construction starts on £18m Beacon of Light sports and education centre \nConstruction company Tolent has started work on the creation of the £18m Beacon of Light centre in Sunderland .
