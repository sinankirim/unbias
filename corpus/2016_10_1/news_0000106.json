I look forward to continued positive collaboration between Nissan and the UK Government.” Read More Is saving North East jobs more important than cutting immigration rates? \nMrs May said: “This Government is committed to creating and supporting the right conditions for the automotive industry to go from strength to strength in the UK, now and into the future.” \nThousands of jobs were on the line as the last-ditch talks took place, with fears that if the car giant could not be reassured, they would chose to produce their new Qashqai model on the continent instead of in North East England. \nThe Sunderland plant, which has been active since 1986, employs almost 7,000 people, and MPs have warned that the Government must do all it can to keep the plant going. \nBritish car exporters could face tariffs of up to 10% if the UK fails to conclude a free trade deal with the rest of the EU and is forced to fall back on basic World Trade Organisation rules.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-10-14T20:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-10-14T16:13:45.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
