Questions are now being asked Share Get daily news by email Qashqai production at Nissan's Sunderland plant \nA row erupted at Westminster over Nissan’s investment in the Sunderland car plant, as Ministers insisted the car giant had not been offered a deal to convince it to stay in the UK. \nBusiness Secretary Greg Clark has been credited by Westminster insiders for convincing the firm it should continue investing in the North East despite Brexit. \nLeaving the EU without a trade deal in place could mean that a tariff is charged on vehicles made in the UK and sold in EU countries. \nBut pressed on whether Nissan had been promised it would receive compensation for any future EU tariffs, he told BBC Radio Four’s World At One: “There is no question of financial compensation over tariffs because we have said that they, what is necessary, is that we are going to maintain the competitiveness of the sector, and we are going to get the best deal possible. We think that the mutual interest between our European neighbours and ourselves is very strong in this way.” \nLabour suggested the Government was refusing to reveal the terms of an agreement. Daniel Leal-Olivas/PA Wire John McDonnell \nJohn McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, said: “This approach which is chaotic because there’s no coherence to it – we don’t know the terms that were agreed with Nissan, we don’t know what the objectives were in the long term. \n“We don’t know what other approaches have been made, particularly in the manufacturing sector – that’s what makes it chaotic and people who want to invest for the long term future want to know at least in the medium term what the government’s approach is.” \nLiberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said he believed Prime Minister Theresa May had given Nissan “special assurances”. \nHe said: “The commitment to Sunderland by Nissan is obviously very welcome. Ensuring that jobs are protected at the plant is vital for Sunderland and our economy. \n“However, it is utterly ridiculous that Theresa May is having to give special assurances to key manufacturers in order to deal with the Brexit fallout her government is creating. \n“What happens when other car companies come asking for special treatment? What about our other major industries - will they also be given protection? And what about the millions of small businesses who are being hit by a collapsing pound and severe economic uncertainty?” Jack Taylor/Getty Images Labour politician Chuka Umunna \nAnd backbench Labour MP Chuka Umunna, a member of the Open Britain campaign which calls for the UK to stay in the single market, said: “Many will now want to know whether specific assurances were given to Nissan, and if so what they were. \n“If certain companies are being given clarity on the UK’s future trade arrangements with the EU, specifically in relation to the Single Market and Customs Union, this should be shared with all who have a stake in the future of the UK economy.” \nBut Conservatives accused critics of failing to welcome the good news for the North East. \nCriticising Mr McDonnell, Tory MP Craig Tracey, a member of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Select Committee, said: “It’s simply astounding that the Labour Party won’t welcome an announcement which will secure 7,000 jobs, boost manufacturing and ensure Britain continues to stand tall on the world stage. \n“It sums up where Labour have got to: divided, divisive and utterly incompetent. They don’t believe Britain can make a success of leaving the EU – and would crash our economy just like they did last time. We must never let them back into government again.” Nissan jobs boost", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-10-27T23:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-10-27T19:11:35.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
