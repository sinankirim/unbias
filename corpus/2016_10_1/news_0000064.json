Newcastle International Airport \n“For example, last month Newcastle International Airport revealed that it is carrying record numbers of passengers – 4.6m in 2015 – with revenues and profits also growing and a marked increase in traffic from hub carriers Air France and Emirates. \n“The recent announcement from Heathrow Airport of plans to further expand domestic flights is also good news for the North East and further strengthens our connections worldwide. \n“As well as making the best use of flight connections, many of the companies in this year’s Ward Hadaway North East Fastest 50 and in previous years have taken advantage of the region’s capabilities in the ports sector to ship goods around the world. \n“Many of the region’s ports are seeing increases in demand for their services from freight and passenger liners whilst the ports themselves are planning major investments in areas such as renewable energy. Arriva bus at Haymarket, Newcastle \n“And major public transport operators based in the North East, such as Arriva and Go-Ahead, are continuing to expand their operations not just in the UK but increasingly overseas. \n“However, despite this encouraging picture, there is the potential for much more to come, which could further benefit all kinds of businesses right across the region.” \nDevolution still has potential to shape future of North East, says law firm boss \nMr Murray cited the pioneering agreement reached earlier this year between Northern port operators PD Ports, Port of Tyne, ABP Ports and Peel Ports to create the Northern Ports Strategy. \nAmongst other things, this calls for £100m of Government money to be invested in an East-West freight ‘super corridor’, boosting road and rail links to enable more goods to pass through Northern ports on both sides of the country. \nMr Murray said: “At the moment, 60% of freight destined for the North travels through Southern ports – imagine how much time, fuel and resources could be saved if a greater proportion went through the North’s ports. \n“It would also greatly increase the capacity for more goods produced in this region to be shipped via North East ports across the world.” The Haymarket Bus Station, Newcastle upon Tyne \nTransport for the North has weighed in to the topic with its Northern Freight and Logistics Report, which was published last month. \nThis highlights the potential for the North’s freight and logistics sector to make a significant contribution to the North’s overall economy with a forecast potential £35bn worth of benefits by 2060, as well as making a positive contribution to the sustainability agenda by encouraging more freight on rail.
