Workers 'live in fear' over the rise of the machine 16:00, 21 Oct 2016 By Jonathan Walker The Government must act to deal with threat of robots taking millions of jobs, says Newcastle Central MP Chi Onwurah Share Get daily news by email The state of the art Da Vinci xi surgical robot used in some hospitals \nNorth East workers “live in fear” that a robot will take their job. \nThat is the view of MP Chi Onwurah , who said the Government needed a plan to deal with the threat of jobs being lost. \nSpeaking in the House of Commons, she highlighted research from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) - an economic body backed by Governments across the world. \nMs Onwurah, Labour MP for Newcastle Central, said: “Many of my constituents live in fear of the rise of the robots, which could result in fewer jobs. \n“OECD research shows that 25% of workers could see the majority of their work automated in the next 10 years.” Schools from across the country took part in a robotics and education competition at Nissan Sunderland last year \nConsultants Deloitte warned earlier this year that more than 11 million British workers could be replaced by robots in the next two decades. \nIt published a report saying a huge proportion of British jobs would be automated by 2036. \nShop assistants and other retail staff were named as the employees most at risk, but all sorts of roles would be affected. \nMiddle class and professional roles which had previously been immune from the threat of automation will increasingly be at risk, as doctors, lawyers, managers and academics find they are no longer needed because computers and robots can do their jobs better and at lower cost. \nThere is disagreement about how many jobs are threatened. \nA paper by Oxford academics Michael Osborne and Carl Frey for Deloitte said 35% of jobs were at risk, more than a third, while a new study by the OECD in May this year said the real figure might be much lower at just 9%, or around one in 10 jobs. Chi Onwurah \nMs Onwurah said the Government should draw up a strategy for digital industries, adding: “I want this Government to be proactive and to use technology to help create more jobs for people across the country.” \nLabour’s Deputy Leader Tom Watson has launched a new commission to study the future of work in Britain and tackle fears about automation. \nSpeaking at Labour’s annual conference in September, he said the world was facing a “fourth industrial revolution” in which technology changed the workplace.

He has said it will include proposals to support industry in every region of the country.
