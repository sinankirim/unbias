This time: more of the same. \nThus it is already shaping up to be another battle to avoid the drop. \nThere have been positives, here and there. \nAt Manchester City, early doors and in terms of, for the most part, organisation. The last half hour against Middlesbrough. The start against Crystal Palace, the end against West Brom. Read More \nBut it has been a testing time for Moyes since he succeeded Sam Allardyce in late July. \nInjuries, Lamine Kone , Younes Kaboul, Patrick Van Aanholt - the hits just keep on coming... \nAnd injuries remain, with Vito Mannone, Jan Kirchhoff, Lee Cattermole, Sebastian Larsson and Adnan Januzaj all ruled out short- to medium-term. \nSo what next, after the current international break and before the next one? What do Sunderland realistically and reasonably need to get out of their next five games? 2016 Getty Images Stoke City (a) \nFirst of all, four away games in five is tough. Sorry for sounding like Johnny Hindsight here, but even with Sunderland’s dismal recent record at the Stadium of Light, it reinforces the importance of the previous two home games. \nOne point from them was probably the bare minimum if you think the team had the same number of points at this stage last season that they do now, and survived. \nBut to maintain that comparison, because two from seven last term then became three from eight, they now need something at Stoke. \nIt is of course not the end of the world if they don’t, those points could be made up later. But when, and how? \nThe boost now would be welcome anyway, as a first of the campaign. But also psychologically, in terms of inkeeping the tally with last year’s ultimately-successful accumulation. Sustaining belief. \nBeating fellow strugglers - the only others in the top flight without a win - would help too. Yes, in that sense this is a six-pointer. \nStoke away was never the mythical mission impossible once perpetuated. Check the record books. \nStoke now could be there for the taking. Poll loading … PA Wire \nSame might go for the Hammers. \nSlaven Bilic’s stock has fallen like a post-Brexit pound coin. His side has lost the plot. New home, one win in seven. That came against \nBournemouth, but West Ham’s other games at the Olympic Stadium have resulted in defeats to Watford and Southampton, and a draw against Middlesbrough. \nYou half expect to spot Mark Noble and Karen Brady on the Hammersmith & City line back to Upton Park like those dogs and the cat from ‘The Incredible Journey’. Or Buzz Lightyear and Woody. \nBut let’s not forget, the east enders still have some good players. Dimitri Payet, Michail Antonio and Cheik Kouyate are canny hands. \nThey are likely to start getting it right sooner rather than later, and will be looking at the visit of Sunderland thinking exactly that, that there is an opportunity. \nSunderland must make it difficult for them, stay tight and disciplined. A draw might do, for now. Poll loading … Southampton (a) - EFL Cup \nSo a break from the little matter of the league, but a welcome one? \nMoyes has said he would love a cup run akin to 2014, for its own sake and for the buoyancy it can bring to league form. \nBut wouldn’t it, in current circumstances, be too much of a distraction? With so many injuries and such little strength in depth? \nHere will be a chance to blood some youth but it is no place to ease back gently players returning from injury. They must remain wrapped in cotton wool. \nTo be frank, forget the cup. Poll loading … Graham Stuart/AFP/Getty Images \nBecause this is what counts, and it won’t be easy. \nArsenal started the season slowly - a familiar trait for them; remind you of anyone? - with defeat to Liverpool and a draw against Leicester City. \nBut they have won their subsequent five in the league, including the crushing of Chelsea, and in all competitions claimed seven victories and a draw. \nOminously for a team often touted as a soft touch at the back, they have not conceded in four games. \nThen again, they came north still chasing the title in late April and went home with a point. Same again is probably as much as Sunderland can hope for, but what a point - in itself, on the table but, also, for confidence - it would be.
