We think that the mutual interest between our European neighbours and ourselves is very strong in this way.” matthew.walker@nissan-nmuk.co.uk Colin Lawther \nColin Lawther, Nissan’s senior vice president for manufacturing in Europe, also denied there was a special deal for the company. \n“No, there is no offer of exchange. It’s just the commitment from the Government to work with the whole of the automotive industry to make sure that the whole automotive industry in the UK remains competitive.” \nAsked if Nissan had received written assurances from the Government on what would happen if tariffs were imposed in the future, he said: “There’s nothing, there’s no special deal for Nissan. We are working within the whole of the automotive industry. We would expect nothing for us that the rest of the industry wouldn’t be able to have access to.” \nMr Lawther said Brexit had created a host of uncertainties for the firm. Owen Humphreys/PA Wire Workers at Nissan working on the Qashqai in Sunderland, as the car giant has decided to build its next Qashqai SUV at the factory, securing thousands of jobs \n“Now, clearly there is this massive basket of unknowns from triggering Article 50 to the end of the process, and it is a massive amount of potential outcomes, so it is not really productive for us to speculate on what could happen. We just trust that the Government will work through diligently to make sure, that as a whole industry, we end up competitive.” \nAs Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell warned about the damage that could be done by “secret deals behind closed doors”, party leader Jeremy Corbyn insisted the Government must make any arrangements with Nissan known. \n“It must be made public, because it is public money that will be used if there are any inducements that have been offered and quite obviously, if you are offering big inducements to one industry or one manufacturer, then all the others will quite reasonably say, ‘Well, what about us?”’ David Parry/PA Wire Nissan chief executive Carlos Ghosn \nMr McDonnell said the lack of clarity about what level of support the Government had offered Nissan was a concern, and highlighted the “chaotic” nature of ministers’ approach to industry. \n“It’s utterly chaotic at the moment. We have got a situation where we get leaks and rumours. Are they now going to decide, literally, factory by factory the support they are going to give?” \nBuilding the X-Trail in Sunderland is an unexpected boost to the Sunderland factory. \nNissan boss Carlos Ghosn went to Downing Street earlier this month for crunch talks with Prime Minister Theresa May. \nHe said on Thursday that the manufacturer could make the production decision due to “support and assurances” from the Government. \nMr Ghosn welcomed Mrs May’s “commitment to the automotive industry” and to the “development of an overall industrial strategy”.
