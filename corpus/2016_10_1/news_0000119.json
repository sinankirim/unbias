A country that doesn’t take care of the young, sick, poor or elderly 10:21, 16 Oct 2016 Kate Thick on why we need to be very nice to our rich neighbours as we build post-Brexit Britain Share Comments Get daily news by email Pictures provided by Oxfam showing the harsh conditions many people are facing in Malawi with extreme poverty, drought and famine \nIf it were possible to transfer money into the right hands, how much would it take to end extreme poverty? About $159 billion a year according to the World Bank, less than 0.2% of global GDP. \nEnding poverty then, if it were just about money, is easy but measuring it accurately is the problem. \nI’ll be in Oxford on Monday - the UN International Day for the Eradication of Poverty - visiting a friend involved with the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI). \nOPHI advocates a multi-dimensional measure of poverty including health, nutrition, education, sanitation, employment, transport, social isolation; a range of living standards which together give a truer picture of poverty. \nOPHI has been lobbying the World Bank to broaden its definition of poverty. The World Bank is sitting on an eagerly awaited potentially groundbreaking report, written by British economist Professor Anthony Atkinson, which will show if the Bank has had a rethink on what poverty is and how to tackle it. \nThe debate on UK poverty has become politically polarised. OPHI also advises The Social Metrics Commission, an independent UK charity recommending new poverty measures to act as a counterweight to the cost-cutting orthodoxy of the Treasury. \nThe Institute of Fiscal Studies warns that levels of child poverty are set to rise by 50% in the next few years. More than a quarter of the UK’s children grow up in households with less than 60% of the median income. Poverty in childhood can be a life sentence; early development, health, emotional wellbeing, educational achievements and life expectancy are all compromised. This is where social and economic reform should start. \nThe UK is currently the 37th most equal country in the world (from data on 145 of 196 of the world’s countries). That makes it a more equal country than the US and Japan but less equal than France, Germany and most Scandinavian countries. \nIndividual cities vary in their equality. Research from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation reveals that London is the most unequal, while Sunderland – Brexit heartland - is the most equal. \nIt is the prevailing poverty of spirit that is vexing me at the moment. Remainers are told to “get over it” but I’m appalled. \nWho are we? A country that doesn’t take care of the young, sick, poor or elderly; a country happy to sell weapons to anybody; a country where families barely make ends meet in the ‘gig economy’; a country denigrating human rights and beating up foreigners. A delusional Little England. \nThe global poor now account for roughly one in ten; poverty has declined markedly, largely due to an explosion of world trade since World War II. \nWhat was argued in the 19th century still holds true says the World Bank; the free movement of goods, capital and people across borders is a source of greater choice and opportunity for those on both sides of the trade. \nIt is a mad system though. The world is $152tn in the red; this sum is more than two times the size of the global economy. It is the very policies the World Bank pushed for decades - austerity, privatisation and financial liberalisation – which contribute to ever weaker and unequal growth, to corporate hegemony and mounting political discontent. \nIf Brexit is about taking back control, Brussels is not the enemy. \nCapitalism needs rethinking for sure but by enlightened values and international cooperation, not by the ugly forces of populism. The world economy is not built to handle waves of fracturing nations. \nBank of England Governor Mark Carney just warned life will get more difficult for the poor due to inflation. Currency markets show that a host of decisions affecting the UK will always be taken outside it. Remember we import more than we export. From trains to energy, many of our utilities are now owned by other countries. \nBrexit does not change the fact that Britain is right next door to a bunch of rich European countries and not especially close to anyone else. A bunch of neighbours, by the way, who have enriched us in so many ways for decades. \nGoodwill in Brussels is drying up. Be polite and generous to your neighbours; they help keep the wolf from your door.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-10-16T17:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-10-16T12:43:08.562+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
