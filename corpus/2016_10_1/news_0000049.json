If you improve the transport links, invested in the science and industry there, you can make the whole bigger than the parts.” Read More Theresa May's new Northern Powerhouse will include the North East \nHe added: “It’s understanding that Leeds, Manchester, Hull and Liverpool, and Sheffield, are all geographically close, and we need to make sure there are links up to the North East.” \nBut the comments were questioned by the chair of the committee, Hartlepool MP Iain Wright, who said it was “very revealing” that Mr Osborne talked about other cities and then mentioned the North East “as an aside”. \nHe asked: “What has the Northern Powerhouse done for the North East?” \nIn response, the former Chancellor highlighted investment in the Institute for Ageing at Newcastle University, which investigates how healthcare and society generally can adapt to the needs of an ageing population. \nBut he added: “There’s an original concept which is the geographical proximity of these northern cities. \n“If you take Manchester - within a 40 mile radius of Manchester there are 10 million people who live. And that is a similar size to London or Tokyo.” \nReferring to the London Underground system, he said: “They are quite close together, so Manchester and Leeds are the same distance as the Central Line in London.” \nHe said the North East was part of the Northern Powerhouse, but said there was a need for “some specific interventions for the North East.” \nIn the same hearing, Mr Osborne urged Mrs May to get on with making a decision on a third runway for Heathrow Airport. \nAnd he appeared to suggest he believes that even more airport expansion will be necessary, telling a committee of MPs that the Government needs to build “runways” if it is to deliver on its ambitions to develop new trade links with countries like China in the wake of the Brexit vote. \nThe Prime Minister has promised a decision on airport capacity in the South East of England by the end of October, with Gatwick also still in the running for a new runway. Reports suggest an announcement - repeatedly delayed under David Cameron’s administration - may come as early as next week. \nMr Osborne said: “Our country has collectively over 60 years dragged its heels on airport expansion. At least the Cameron government has set us up for a decision over Heathrow or Gatwick, but we have got to take it as a country.” \nHe added: “Governments that are serious about economic productivity improvements need to go ahead and build runways. They can’t claim we are going to be trading with the rest of the world if we don’t have airports that planes can land on.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-10-12T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-10-11T20:26:14.070+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
