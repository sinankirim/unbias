only to be replaced by Mr Ashley. \nSports Direct has also been held up by CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn as a bad example of UK businesses. \nSpeaking to the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association conference in London, Ms Fairbairn said: “We know there have been some real mistakes made, and I think we can all name some individuals recently, you know, when you see the story of BHS or we see what’s happened at Sports Direct. \n“I think we all can say that’s not what businesses stand for.” \nWhile Ms Fairbairn said that these mistakes are being made by a slim proportion of UK firms, she stressed that the other “99%” of companies “now need to treat it as their problem too.” \n“We are going to have to see some changes in the way businesses talk about themselves. We need to get better at telling the positive story.” \nThe CBI chief also lamented the fact that, while the organisation had real strengths, there is a real challenge representing “modern British business,” and introducing adequate diversity. \n“I’m incredibly keen on having more women,” she said, adding that the composition of the BVCA conference showed that “there’s work to be done here.” \n“But it’s a challenge we’re all facing...even with all of this Brexit stuff, when I go out to talk to members, they are really keen on just getting diversity of their companies up, because it’s a talent issue and it’s a growth issue.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-10-07T23:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-10-07T19:07:52.964+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
