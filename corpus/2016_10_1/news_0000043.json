Read More Nissan must have been given 'very strong assurances' on single market, Tony Blair says \nSome reports - denied by the Government and by Nissan - suggest the Japanese manufacturer was promised compensation for the cost of any tariffs which could be levied on cars manufactured in the UK after Brexit. \nThis would raise questions about whether other carmakers, and firms in other sectors of the economy, can expect to receive the same protection. \nKeir Starmer, Labour’s Shadow Secretary of State for Exiting the EU, said the Government must fully explain the deal with Nissan. \nHe said: “It’s welcome that the Government have done a deal with Nissan that protects jobs and supports the local community and economy. But that deal needs to be accompanied by transparency and accountability. \n“We can’t have the Government doing deals that affect jobs and the future of our economy without telling the public or parliament what the basic terms are.” \nDowning Street confirmed there had been some sort of written communication with the firm. A Downing Street spokesman told journalists at Westminster: “There’s been communications in all forms.” Read More Hundreds of new jobs likely to be created at Nissan's Sunderland plant \nBut they insisted: “We’ve made it perfectly clear, Nissan have made it perfectly clear, there was no deal, there was no compensation package, there was nothing about tariffs.” \nThe Business Secretary also insisted no financial favours were offered when he appeared on BBC show Question Time on Thursday night, saying: “There’s no chequebook. I don’t have a chequebook.” \nMr Clark said: “The important thing is that they know this is a country in which they can have confidence they can invest. That was the assurance and the understanding they had, and they have invested their money.” Colin Lawther, Nissan’s European senior vice president for manufacturing \nAnd Colin Lawther, Nissan’s senior vice president for manufacturing in Europe, also denied there was a special deal for the company. \nHe said: “No, there is no offer of exchange. It’s just the commitment from the Government to work with the whole of the automotive industry to make sure that the whole automotive industry in the UK remains competitive,” he said. \nBut former Prime Minister Tony Blair said Nissan had clearly received some form of reassurance. \nHe told the BBC Radio Four’s Today programme: “I know the leadership at Nissan, I’m absolutely sure they would not have made this commitment unless they received very strong assurances from the UK government. Now, if the UK government are giving those assurances, I welcome that. \n“I should imagine they gave strong assurances about the car industry’s access to the single market. If this is an indication that the UK government are giving strong assurances about access to the single market, this would be important.” \nNissan jobs boost: Opposition parties demand to know if the Government did a deal with Nissan \nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: “It must be made public, because it is public money that will be used if there are any inducements that have been offered and, quite obviously, if you are offering big inducements to one industry or one manufacturer, then all the others will quite reasonably say ‘Well, what about us?’.” \nSharon Hodgson, the MP representing the Washington and Sunderland West constituency where the Nissan plant is sited, has avoided the controversy. She said her focus was on the jobs that had been safeguarded. \nReferring to a meeting between Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn and Prime Minister Theresa May, she told the BBC: “Whatever that conversation happened between Carlos and Theresa May in Number 10 a couple of weeks ago, it worked. \n“Whatever was said, it’s fantastic. \n“This is fantastic news and nothing should distract us from how positive this is.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-10-29T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-10-29T07:19:21.070+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
