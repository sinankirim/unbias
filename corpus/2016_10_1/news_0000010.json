Considering his future. It was time for someone else to have a go. Fed up of the abuse. \nBut by Monday, following talks with chairman David Newton, things had gone full circle. It was Greene for stay. \nThere was perhaps a nagging doubt that the Boston boss was actually going to turn his back on the club. \nHe is a character who can live very much in the moment - as many of his in-game substitutions have proven - and lives and dies by decisions he makes on the spot. Often a gambler, a risk-taker. \nHe has won regularly over the past three years as the club completed seasons in sixth, third and fifth. \nBut there’s another side to the coin and not everything has gone to plan so far this year. \nWhen you conduct your on-field business like this, the highs are higher and the lows are lower. \nDefeats are magnified. \nSo while I believe that Greene meant the words which came out of his mouth after that defeat, there was always a possibility that, if the chairman so wished, the position could change. \nReading back the reasons Greene gave for calling it quits, only one would seem enough to make anyone really want to walk - abuse. \nIt’s a strange situation at the Jakemans Stadium right now. \nYes, the manager is getting stick from sections of his own fans. \nSome are fed up that recent highs aren’t being matched, others eager for a complete overhaul. \nGreene, again living in those moments, often doesn’t shy away from giving some back, on the pitch and online, which rarely helps such situations but raises questions about how passive people in sport should be when facing criticism. \nBut this week he has also received a large amount of support from fans keen for him to stay. \nJust as we’ve seen with Brexit in recent months, if you stand on one side of a clear divide then you regularly become more passionate and vocal about your opinion. \nAnd like Brexit, whether you like the outcome or not, a decision has been made.
