And many will certainly be prominent on the new list of Top 200 North East companies soon to be revealed. \nSome such firms of the past, true, have since become major public limited companies - Greggs, for example, a favourite City share for 32 years since, and the former Cowie motor group, now DB Arriva. Both continue to excel, transformed, in this Top 200. \nBut also many businesses that are still privately owned reach the list, often family run, and still proudly independent. Fenwick’s department stores - founded in Newcastle and now with 11 branches around the country – came in last year at 24th on £290.2m sales. With additional investment recently made, it could this year again be top among the “privates”. \nThe next four highest of the private representation last year – Esh construction group (27th), Hays Travel (30th), and two Teesside flag fliers, Cleveland Cable (32nd) and Gibson O’Neill (37th) – should all excel again. \nEsh, building homes and commercial and public property across the North and in Scotland, has enjoyed a strong year ahead of Brexit uncertainties, and along with Hays Travel recently made The Sunday Times Profit Track 100 List of the UK’s fastest growing private firms. \nIn Middlesbrough, self-made millionaire Steve Gibson has enjoyed, with his 25% business partner Michael O’Neill, a profits rise from Gibson O’Neill which owns Bulkhaul, Premiership club Middlesbrough FC (which Gibson saved from liquidation in 1986), Rockliffe Hall Hotel in Darlington and Gibson O’Neill Properties. \nIt’s hard to see Cleveland Cable Company, also in Middlesbrough, falter greatly either. A major European distributor of electrical cable, this business has steadily advanced since brothers Alastair and Michael Powell started it in 1978. \nRecession in the oil and gas sector has done no favours for Newcastle engineers British Engines and Reece Group, however. \nBritish Engines (53rd last year) could slip a bit now, its latest turnover showing a 3.7% fall to £139.5m amid ongoing trading difficulties. About 90 among 1,500 jobs are likely to be shed in a restructure. British Engines has proven staying power, though, founded in 1922 and operating now not only in Newcastle but also Longbenton, South Shields, Cramlington, Gateshead and Bishop Auckland.

Having invested £20m to occupy the famous Armstrong Works at Scotswood, it clearly has long term aspirations for 33,000sq m of manufacturing space. \nOther privately owned businesses sure to be in the frame include South Tyneside clothier Barbour (up three to 46 last year), and Simpsons Malt, Berwick’s fifth generation firm (up four previously to 50). It contributes to quality beers from brewers such as Adnams, Theakstons and Timothy Taylor – and to the glow of Grant’s Glenfiddich whisky. \nLooking at the ages of some of the region’s most successful privately owned companies – Fenwick 134, Simpsons Malt 154, Ringtons 109 and Barbour 122 – we can expect strongly rooted companies that have avoided public sharelistings to be healthily present in the Top 200 for many years yet. \nKaren Simms, head of company and commercial at Sintons, said: “As a law firm very proud of our roots, and of our 120 year heritage in this region, we are delighted to again support the Top 200, such a very important forum for celebrating the continuing success of North East business. We are a region known for our strength in so many sectors, and we boast businesses which lead the way nationally and internationally. \n“Sintons is well known and respected across the North East, and well beyond, for our capability in advising businesses at all stages of development, with our sizeable team able to handle matters of any size or complexity. We are particularly highly regarded for our work with private and family owned businesses, and pride ourselves on offering a service which will see businesses working with Sintons for many years; indeed it is common for our client relationships to span several generations of ownership. \n“Given our strength in that area, we are delighted to sponsor the Privately Owned Business award for another year, and to again throw our backing behind the Top 200.” Read More Who will be the companies breaking into the North East's Top 200? How the table is compiled \nThe Top 200 table is compiled from publicly available sources by PwC in Newcastle. All information comes from published audited accounts of companies filed at Companies House, or made available on the company website. Companies in the list are ranked in order of latest turnover. \nCompanies are identified as having a registered office address in the region (i.e. the postcode area is one of the following; NE, SR, DH, DL or TS). \nDeadline for inclusion for this year is October 24. Join the award winners \nA Top 200 awards presentation breakfast, open to all, will be held at the Stadium of Light, Sunderland, on Tuesday, November 15 (7.30am-10.30am approximately). Guests will receive their copy of the Top 200 supplement a day ahead of general publication. \nFor table and ticket bookings, or to find out about sponsorship opportunities, please contact Amy Evans, events manager, T: 0191 201 6092 E: amy.evans@trinitymirror.com \nSponsors of the Top 200 - besides the North East England Chamber of Commerce (associate) and PwC (research) – include Durham University Business School (support), North East Business & Innovation Centre (highest new entry), Sintons (privately owned category), and Sunderland College (the number one company).", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-10-11T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-10-10T20:08:02.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
