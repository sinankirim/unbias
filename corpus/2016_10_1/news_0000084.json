Owen Humphreys/PA Wire Workers at Nissan's plant in Sunderland \nHe said: “If I need to make an investment in the next few months and I can’t wait until the end of Brexit, then I have to make a deal with the UK Government. \n“You can have commitments of compensation in case you have something negative. If there are tax barriers being established on cars, you have to have a commitment for car-makers who export to Europe that there is some kind of compensation.” \nThis week, North MPs warned of the dire consequences of losing Nissan. Read More Nissan jobs are 'hanging by a thread' over Brexit, union warns \nSunderland Central MP Julie Elliott asked Brexit Secretary David Davis for details of the Government plans, saying: “When will the Secretary of State reassure businesses based in the UK, and particularly in my city of Sunderland, including the Nissan manufacturing plant, about the potential for tariffs to be paid on every car sold to mainland Europe, as some 80% of cars from the Nissan plant are? \n“Investment has been halted at that plant, and a contract that had already been awarded has been put in abeyance while ​we wait for reassurances from the Government. When will the Government act on real people’s jobs and reassure companies? \n“That is what is at stake. This is not chatter; it is real people’s jobs. When will the Government act?” \nBut Mr Davis was unable to provide any specifics in his reply. \nHe said: “We have said in terms - principally after the Japanese letter - that we are absolutely determined to make sure that we guarantee, or acquire, access for all companies in the UK to the maximum possible number of markets. That is what we are doing.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-10-14T20:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-10-14T15:35:19.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
