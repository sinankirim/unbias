The Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham this week is a very good place for the new Government to begin to set it out. \nThe plan does not need all the answers, but it needs some. We should not expect to see the full shape of the UK’s negotiating position, but we should hope for answers on three things. \nFirst, resounding reassurance that this Government is truly pro-enterprise; second, a genuine partnership between Government and business; and, third, a domestic plan to build prosperity and confidence. \nTaking each of these in turn. First, a pro-business and pro-enterprise government. This is absolutely vital for the success of Brexit. \nThough the referendum was largely a political event, its consequences will be economic and felt in the reality of people’s lives for years and decades to come. Only if UK business thrives will the outcome be positive for jobs and living standards. \nEarly signs are that firms’ priorities for the new EU deal are well understood by several on the new front bench: maximising single market access; securing global talent alongside a skilled domestic workforce; ambitious new trade deals. May this progress continue. \nSecond, we need a genuine partnership at eye-level between Government and business. Engagement today is fragmented and piecemeal. \nWhat is urgently needed is a proper architecture and roadmap for business consultation, sector by sector, region by region, for big business and small. And it should be set up to last years, not months. \nThis will bring two advantages. It will give firms confidence they are being heard at a time when unavoidable negotiating gamesmanship with the EU may make open communication difficult. Even more important, it will provide the evidence base - from the shop, factory and office floor – to prevent bad decisions and maximise good ones. \nBusiness needs to do the same – organise itself well, avoid thousands of separate wish-lists, be easy to deal with. This is working well in some sectors, for example, nationally in financial services and regionally the North East is coming together across public and private sectors, but there is more to do. \nAs a voice for the whole economy, speaking for firms from all sectors, the CBI can help prevent fragmentation and ensure clear airwaves from firms to government and vice versa. \nThird, we need a domestic plan to build confidence and prosperity. At its heart should be a focus on unlocking growth and productivity across the regions and nations of the UK. \nThese are the drivers of increasing productivity, rising living standards and growing opportunities for our children. The energy of the referendum result gives us a golden opportunity to address them. \nIt’s time for a fresh start in the relationship between Government, business and the communities of the UK. ‘Open for business’ must become more than a slogan, it must be a positive plan from a pro-enterprise Government. \nSarah Glendinning is regional director of the CBI", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-10-04T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-10-03T20:34:08.464+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
