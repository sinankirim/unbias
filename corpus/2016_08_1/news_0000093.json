Photo by Doug Moody Photography \nMobile Mini UK, which hires out portable accommodation and secure storage containers, has seen half-year revenues rise again on the back of a major investment. \nThe Stockton-headquartered company, which is the UK arm of a global operation based in Arizona, saw turnover grow to £28.9m in the six months ended June 30. This represents a slight increase on the comparable period last year when, following significant expansion, the half-year figure was £28.2m. \nThe latest period of growth was supported by £5.2m investment in new units for the company’s rental fleet, including the addition of industry-leading, cost-effective and energy-efficient Groundhog Fusion mobile welfare units. \nMobile Mini’s growing fleet of rental units now stands at over 36,000 across 16 depots nationwide, from Glasgow to Southampton. \nContinued investment in its growing workforce across the UK has also taken its total number of employees to more than 400, with 40 new positions created over the past 12 months. \nThis year, it intends to invest a further £3.7m in its fuel-efficient Scania delivery truck fleet. \nBy the end of 2016, it will have a total fleet of 50 lorry-mounted loader crane vehicles, one of the largest of its kind in the UK. \nMobile Mini managing director Chris Morgan said: “Despite some uncertainty following the recent Brexit vote , we saw strong growth in the first half of the year and June 2016 in particular was a record month for us, with continued strong demand from the construction industry. \n“We’re determined to maintain our market leading position by continuing to invest in our people and products, so that we exceed our customers’ expectations and continue to build strong long term relationships with them.” \nMobile Mini UK Ltd is the UK division of Mobile Mini Inc, the world’s leading provider of portable storage solutions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-08-17T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-08-16T20:49:00.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
