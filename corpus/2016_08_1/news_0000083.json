She drives an Audi TT. \nQ - How do you think the Olympics have gone? Was the media too negative in the build-up? And what about that green diving pool? \nA - The Games have been very interesting to watch so far. Compared to the London Games, I think the media this year has been quite mixed – more so in the build-up. But as there's been a lot of coverage, hopefully the Games will increase public interest in sports, particularly among young people. The diving has been brilliant and some athletes have even said the bright green pool has helped with their rotations so I guess there's a positive in the strange occurrence. \nQ - The Bank of England seems to be in trouble with its post-Brexit bond-buying. How big a deal is it? \nA - The BoE's bond-buying is aimed at decreasing the cost of borrowing for companies and individuals, and this should stimulate investment and cushion the economy from a downturn following Brexit. However, there is concern in the financial markets as the Bank has failed to meet its target of buying £1 billion in long-dated government debt. Whilst this isn't great news, there are still other measures that the central Bank can and will take to prop up the economy – such as quantitative easing. And of course if needs be, the Treasury may need to look at fiscal measures such as cutting VAT to further stimulate the economy. \nQ - The David Brent movie is just out. What would be the theme of the movie about your life at work? \nA - My life at work is thankfully nothing like the 1990s movie Office Space! A bit of comedy is vital in life but I also work in a great inspiring environment so I would say The Pursuit of Happiness meets the lighter side of Working Girl. \nQ - Is the historic whitewashed wall of Newarke Houses Museum an appropriate place for a vast Leicester City mural? \nA - The Newarke Houses Museum is an important part of the city. However, I think as long as the mural, below, does not cause any permanent damage, it could be a nice artistic touch to celebrate the heritage of the LCFC owners. \nQ - Are you seeing big deals slowing down because of the Brexit vote? \nA - No! I've had a number of clients sell their businesses and come to me for tax advice post-Brexit, so there has been no significant slowdown since June 23. \nQ - Leicester City's owners bought each of the players a £100,000 supercar as thanks for winning the Premier League title. What's the best gift your boss has ever given you? \nA - I was treated to dinner at a very nice restaurant by my boss to celebrate my promotion! Perhaps a supercar will be next… \nQ - What should be done about parents selfishly parking outside school gates? \nA - Schools perhaps need to work with parents and children so that they feel comfortable parking a bit further way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-08-16T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-08-16T13:43:56.123+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
