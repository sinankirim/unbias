Alasdair Greig of Northstar Ventures \nMr Hartley, who founded the business, said: “The impact regional investment can have should not be underestimated – particularly in light of the current discussions surrounding Brexit and the Northern Powerhouse. \n“With the investment and support we received from Northstar Ventures, Fairstone was able to increase its annual revenues from £15m at the inception of the relationship to its current run-rate of £36m. \n“In addition, Northstar’s involvement and guidance was pivotal in enabling us to transition away from a shareholder base comprising mainly of high-net-worth individuals through to professional Private Equity shareholders – a changeover which was crystallised in the new £25m equity investment in April this year.” \nFairstone operates nationally, but has kept its headquarters in Boldon. \nAside from support from Northstar Ventures, it benefits from a strong relationship with Northumbria University, with which it runs a dedicated graduate recruitment programme. \nNorthstar, which is currently investing from three North East-focussed funds, was recently named the sixth most active venture capital investor within UK start-ups. \nResearch conducted by PitchBook - an international database covering venture capital, private equity and mergers and acquisitions - found that since 2014, 607 venture capital firms have made at least one investment into UK-based start-ups. \nIn the same period, Northstar made 34 investments, all into North East companies. \nNorthstar director Alasdair Greig said: “In the last few years we’ve seen the local business community thrive, with start-ups across the region including Middlesbrough , Sunderland and Newcastle attracting talent and finance from other areas of the UK and beyond. \n“Without access to regional investment, these companies may have been forced to relocate in order to compete for funding.” \nHe added that Northstar had also seen a growing willingness from other VCs and private investors to invest outside of London, and to support Northern entrepreneurs. \n“The investments we’ve made from the Finance for Business North East Proof of Concept and Accelerator funds alone have leveraged £168m additional investment into North East companies since 2010,” he said. \n“Companies like Fairstone are a huge asset to the North East economy and are evidence of how successful regional investment strategies have been in recent years.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-08-30T19:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-08-30T15:28:16.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
