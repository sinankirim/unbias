Nobody could pray,” he said. \n“It’s a sad situation, it looks like it is Islamophobic. There’s been a rise in hate crime, especially after Brexit, and people from minority communities are on edge. \n“It’s not the first time the building’s been attacked, someone once put a pig’s head inside.” Councillor Dipu Ahad \nPolice officers were called to the scene but a Northumbria Police spokesperson was unable to confirm if the incident was being treated as a hate crime. \nA spokesperson said: “We got a call at 1.20pm on Friday to the Mitre in Benwell Lane, Newcastle to reports of a burglary. “A number of windows had been smashed. Police inquiries are ongoing.” \nThe grade II-listed building was turned into a pub called The Mitre in the 1970s before becoming famous as the children’s TV youth club. \nMost recently, the building was bought in 2012, in a bid to set up an Islamic faith school and prayer centre for Muslims. The Newcastle-based Bahr Academy bought the site, which includes Benwell Towers and Welburn House, for £400,000 four years ago. \nIt hopes to establish a school for 340 boys and girls between 11 and 16 as well as a community building, coffee shop and events space open at weekends. The former Bishop's Palace buildings, now part of the Bahr Academy \nBuilt in 1831 by architect John Dobson, the property was home to the bishops of Newcastle in the late 1800s, before being used as a fire station during the Second World War. \nAfter it was converted into a pub and restaurant, it was then turned into the TV set where Byker Grover was filmed for 17 years. \nGeordie duo Ant and Dec, who started their careers on Byker Grove, admitted in 2014 that they had tried to buy the buildings to turn them into a performing arts centre, but their bid was unsuccessful. \nThe new school will be for young people who want to become Islamic scholars and clerics.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-08-01T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-08-01T18:21:21.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
