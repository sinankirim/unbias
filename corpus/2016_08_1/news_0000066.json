jewellery and watch store is expecting to double its sales after a £3 million investment, writes Isobel Frodsham. \nMappin & Webb's Regent Street store in central London, is expected to achieve £20 million worth of sales this year. \nIt is the result of a significant investment into the brand over the past six months. \nThe business is part of the Aurum Holdings empire which has its headquarters on the Braunstone Frith Industrial Estate, just outside Leicester. \nAurum, which also owns Watches of Switzerland and Goldsmiths, announced earlier this year that it had bought watch repair specialist The Watch Lab, which has 16 locations around the UK, including one in Leicester's Highcross \nTwo years ago, Aurum Group bought the Watch Shop brand to exploit online demand for the fashion end of the market. \nLast autumn, it acquired Watch Hut. \nCraig Bolton, executive director at Mappin & Webb and Goldsmiths, said: \"Mappin & Webb is a great brand and it's been around since 1775. \n\"However, over the last three or four years it has lacked investment. \n\"We've spent a lot of money on Goldsmiths and Watches of Switzerland, and Mappin & Webb was the last brand we hadn't really invested in. \n\"The Mappin & Webb Regent Street store was looking tired, but it traded well through that. \n\"The store was budgeted to increase sales in the region of 50 per cent more than it was doing before, so £20 million, and we are more than on plan to achieve that. \n\"We've got a double benefit at the moment as our traffic has been fantastic from an international point of view post-Brexit.\" \nAurum chief executive Brian Duffy, below, said: \"I am so proud of this boutique. It is stunning and elegant, yet warm and inviting. \n\"This is perfect for the relaunch of our cherished 241-year-old Mappin & Webb brand. \n\"We have a great team in place and fantastic new products and services.\" \nThe brand, which is a holder of a Royal Warrant, has benefited from a £10 million investment after the business raised money from its shareholder, Apollo, a US-based financial wealth management and investment group. \nThis money has gone into revamping the business's stores, updating its products and marketing the brand. \nMr Bolton said: \"Our principle behind this relaunch is that we could be the British Tiffany, and be as successful as them, but be more home-grown, authentic and British.\" \nHe said the directors started off by improving its product offering, in particular its bridal range, and relaunching its own Mappin & Webb watches. It has also launched a bespoke service for its jewellery called By Appointment. \nStaff then received jewellery and watch training and the website was relaunched. \nRead more: Sales of luxury watches ticking along nicely for Aurum \nFinally, the business converted two Goldsmiths stores in Newcastle and Royal Tunbridge Wells into Mappin & Webb stores, taking the total number of Mappin & Webb stores up to 13, and then placed a capsule collection of the Mappin & Webb products in 10 Goldsmiths stores. \nA Goldsmiths store in Guildford, Surrey, is also going to be converted into a Mappin & Webb store in the future. \nMr Bolton said: \"Ten stores have been launched with the Mappin & Webb products, one of which is the Leicester store, and the other 13 are going to launch on September 5. \n\"In September, we're also launching our marketing campaign which will take us through Christmas. \n\"For the first time in our history we have appointed a face to the brand. We've chosen actress and model Gabriella Wilde (pictured left). \n\"She's beautiful, authentic, aristocratic in her background and all the parts she has played as an actress work really well within the brand. \n\"Poldark, for example, is one of the big shows she's involved in.\" \nAurum is aiming to build Mappin & Webb by selling its products in places such as Asia and America.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-08-16T16:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-08-16T13:43:09.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
