It also had continued success in securing planning consent for its strategic land bank, with 2,856 plots converted. \nTrading was boosted throughout the six months by the opening of four new businesses, including that in Stockton, Teesside. \nChairman Nicholas Wrigley said: “These new businesses have continued to make good progress in scaling up to meet local market demand whilst allowing their sister companies to optimise their delivery in adjoining territories. \n“By adopting this carefully managed approach to supporting group operations we secure high quality control over all our activities and maximise our efficiencies. We anticipate these four new businesses will deliver around 1,600 units over the next 12 months.” \nAt the period end, Persimmon had net cash of £462m, up from £278m the previous year. Forward sales, meanwhile, amounted to £1.75bn. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-08-23T22:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-08-23T17:06:46.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
