This means it gets involved in some pretty impressive, high-profile projects including Lord's in London, New Street Station, Birmingham and the Heathrow TB2 project. \nIn France, it helps out with the maintenance of The Louvre, in Paris. \nIn addition to its 26 depots in the UK, Lavendon has six depots in France and also operates out of Belgium and Germany. \nIt also has a well-established business in the Middle East, in Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. \nRead more: Lavendon CEO Don Kenny on mission to raise company's share price \nThe company said it saw strong rental revenue growth in its home market as well as France and Saudi Arabia. \nLavendon chief executive Don Kenny said: \"The group's trading performance in the first half has seen the delivery of strong revenue growth that has driven further improvements in our profits and operational cash flows. This growth has built upon the momentum established within the business towards the end of 2015 with the UK, Middle East and France being the primary drivers. \n\"Our growth reflects our strategic fleet investment decisions in 2015 and the actions taken in the first half to optimise our fleet deliveries and improve our operational processes. We haven't seen any impact post-Brexit. \n\"The restructuring of our German business is progressing as planned and is on track to be operational in quarter four. The group's strong operational cash flows and strength of our balance sheet enables us to develop our market positions with investment, underpinning the positive momentum created within the business, whilst at the same time remaining within our preferred debt leverage range.\" \nHe said the UK's decision to leave the EU has not had any impact on the business. \nHe said: \"Trading since the half year has continued to be in line with our expectations and, whilst mindful of the recent increased economic uncertainty, the board remains confident of making further progress in the second half and delivering on its expectations for 2016.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-08-26T22:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-08-26T19:02:00.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
