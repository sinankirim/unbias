All people should be treated the same.” Lisa Duffy, prospective UKIP leader, at the Marriott Metrocentre \nFormer UKIP director Ms Duffy said being tough on law and order and supporting the NHS are her top policy priorities. \nShe added: “I really want to build on our manifesto. We have voted to leave the EU and now we need to make sure we get the best Brexit deal. \n“Nigel Farage did an amazing job but it can’t be one individual. We need a strong team now to lead the party forward. \n“I have a lot of affection for the North East - the people wear their hearts on their sleeves and are very honest. \n“It is important to make sure that the North East and the north of the country are not forgotten.” \nMs Duffy is up against UKIP MEPs Jonathan Arnott, who represents the North East, Bill Etheridge and Diane James, as well as national executive committee member Liz Jones and former parliamentary candidate Phillip Broughton. \nThe winning candidate will be announced at UKIP’s annual conference in Bournemouth on September 15.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-08-08T23:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-08-09T00:30:26.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
