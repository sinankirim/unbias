Labour still believes that we should be a part of the European Union .” \nAnd Ms Onwurah, Labour MP for Newcastle Central, echoed those claims - saying Brexit has become a “shambles” since 52.5% of people voted to leave the EU in June.

Stefan Rousseau/PA Wire EU and UK flags fly above the EU Commission offices in Westminster \nShe said: “We will trigger Article 50 when we are ready and not before. We have over 40 years of EU regulation and laws to extricate ourselves from, and new trade deals to strike with the world’s major economies who are queuing up to make deals.” \nThe MP for Berwick added that the mandate of the Brexit vote cannot be ignored, after more than 30m people turned out to vote - more than in last year’s general election. \nShe said: “The Prime Minister has been very clear that there will not be a second referendum. The turnout for the referendum extremely very high, and more people voted in it than have ever voted for anything before.” \nAnd Ms Trevelyan took a swipe at the opposition party, as ballot papers for the second leadership election in two years are sent out. \nShe said: “Whilst the Labour party continues to tear itself apart with its ongoing leadership election, the Conservatives are getting on with running the country and ensuring that we follow through with the nation’s decision and making a success of the fantastic new opportunities it presents.” Poll loading …", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-08-24T21:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-08-24T17:47:07.563+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
