Smith has led to 18 job losses. \nIt follows news last week that UK construction industry continued to decline in June, raising fears that the British economy is on course for sharp slowdown in the wake of the EU referendum result. \nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) said construction output dropped by 0.9% in the month of the Brexit vote, compared to a 2.1% fall in May. \nRedbox’s managing director Barry Farrar said: “We had five major projects that have been either delayed or stopped altogether as a result of Brexit. Before that I had been looking to recruit staff but even those projects that had been delayed were for six or nine months and we just couldn’t continue. \n“The construction industry is always the first sector that gets hit in a downturn and it’s the last sector to pick up again. I would hope other practices aren’t hit but it could happen.” \nRedbox, which had had offices in London and Amsterdam and had worked extensively in China, is responsible for a number of landmark buildings in the North East, including the Sunderland Aquatic Centre, the Newcastle-Gateshead Hilton, the conversion of the old Post Office in Newcastle - where it was previously based - and the Northern Design Centre, to where it had moved in 2014. \nIt also designed the Clements Wharf development in Durham, college buildings in Newcastle , Sunderland and Gateshead, and the Radisson Blu hotel in Durham. Outside of the region, Redbox had won national acclaim for its work on the Football Association’s St George’s Park training centre at Burton upon Trent. \nThe property and construction sector has seen the main immediate hit from the Brexit vote, with a number of investors stalling on large projects and reducing investments in the UK. \nLast month Newcastle-based LSL Property Services, the country’s second largest estate agency firm, warned that its profits were likely to be well below previous expectations as a result of uncertainty in the market. \nThe latest Markit/CIPS construction purchasing managers’ index, which measures the health of the sector, showed that the industry had recorded its fastest fall since June 2009 last month, with a reading of 45.9 in July, down slightly from 46 in June but above economists’ expectations of 44. \nSamuel Tombs, chief UK economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the official data showed that the sector re-entered recession as public sector cuts and Brexit uncertainty took their toll.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-08-17T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-08-16T20:49:08.267+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
