It is a literary sanctuary proving a lifeline to a community shattered by war. The 13-year-old boy, Ahmad, helping take care of the library was trying to sound chipper as the civil war raged ever closer. \nSo to hear the Bank of England has identified household debt as one of the most significant risks to our economy came as light relief, as does the good news that Mrs May has signalled a new approach to industrial policy. \nThe recently published Northern Independent Economic Review says the north of England has the potential to add £97bn and 850,000 more jobs to the UK by 2050, but with local libraries and community services closing right, left and centre, the very underpinnings of empowerment look endangered. Ahmad would be aghast. \nWe lag behind in health, life expectancy, employment, earnings and productivity. According to IPPR North, we are catching up but there is still a skills gap and the region’s economic output per head remains about 25% below the average for the rest of England. \nMrs May hit the Hinkley Point nuclear power deal pause button, a hugely expensive project which would be a lousy deal for taxpayers. If we really do need Chinese investment, put it into small and medium scale infrastructure projects, into education and business development so regions like the North East can flourish. \nI felt Mr Osborne’s Northern Powerhouse concept sounded a bit too grandiose and gimmicky. It needn’t be the only game in town surely. I want solid projects; if, for example, we linked with Scotland in developing renewable energy production we could, literally, be the UK’s powerhouse. \nThe Hinkley saga exemplifies the failings of decades of British industrial policy. The lack of a long-term strategy is replicated across most sectors of the economy - biotech, transport, energy production as well as advanced manufacturing. \nMrs May has downgraded the concept of a northern powerhouse in favour of halving the productivity gap between the south east and the rest of the UK ... which is excellent but tricky to pull off if tax revenues fall and public fiscal spending rises. No quick wins can be expected from an industrial strategy but Mrs May rightly emphasises that support for the UK’s 5.4m small businesses will be a big part of it. \nIt was Britain’s hitherto borderless approach to capital and labour that helped make us a European tech centre, a position threatened by Brexit. But areas highly affected by the likes of Chinese import competition voted for Brexit . \nOnly upping skills will compensate those losing out from free trade; Germany and America have sophisticated systems of apprenticeship for this very purpose. The EU’s Globalisation Adjustment Fund does something similar which Britain, for now at least, can apply to. \nI hate to say it but research shows foreign owned firms are more productive with better management, technology, R&D investment and wages – though fewer tea breaks and some job losses – than comparable British firms. \nOnly about 15% of those on unemployment benefit receive any sort of training. Data from the OECD shows Britain has been a stingy spender when it comes to skills improvement of the unemployed or under-employed; we spend about one-fifth of what Germany invests. \nPeople want to shape the societies in which they live. Pope Francis blamed the “god of money” for extremist violence in Europe and the Middle East, saying that a ruthless global economy leads disenfranchised people to violence. \nWe do not need ideological choices between globalisation, market and state intervention; we need a social policy to dictate foreign, public and private investment. A new approach has to start from the idea that the basic responsibility of government is to maximise the welfare of its citizens. \nPerhaps Ahmad, if he survives, will have read enough books to be a bit of a tech geek by the time he, hopefully, gets here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-08-05T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-08-05T21:09:59.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
