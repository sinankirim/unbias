Go back to your own country”. \nA picture of region-wide racist incidents has emerged from accounts collected by the social media sites PostRefRacism, Worrying Signs and iStreetWatch. \nThe worrying trend comes as figures show the number of hate crimes reported to police in the North East in the week following the EU referendum rose. \nThere were 53 hate crimes reported to Northumbria and Durham police forces in the week of June 24 to June 30, up from 49 in the seven days before. \nDuring the week following the referendum, there were 42 crimes reported in Northumbria, up from 39, and 11 in Durham, up from 10. \nThe number was much higher than the 27 crimes reported in the same week in 2015. \nThe most common type of hate complained of was racial, with 34 incidents in Northumbria and nine in Durham. \nThe figures obtained following a Freedom of Information request are provisional as numbers may change if more victims come forward or following investigations of incidents.

It’s simply not right that anyone puts up with being targeted because of who they are and we actively encourage anyone who has been a victim of hate crime to report this to us so we can deal with those responsible and prevent it happening again. \n“Both Newcastle and Gateshead are safe places where we have diverse communities living and working side by side peacefully but unfortunately there are a minority, and it is only a minority, who try to disrupt this, and we will make sure swift and robust action is taken against these people. \n“There is no place for this in our region for hate crime, we will not stand-by and allow this to happen and we will be there to support and reassure all of our communities.” \nRace hate incidents that have occurred across the UK since the June 23 EU referendum \nWhat the social media sites in their own report describe as an “explosion of blatant hate” has included: Gangs prowling the streets demanding passers-by prove they can speak English Swastikas in Armagh, Sheffield, Plymouth, Leicester, London and Glasgow.
