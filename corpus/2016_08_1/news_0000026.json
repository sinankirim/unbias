05:30, 30 Aug 2016 Councillors from the seven local authorities will be asked to approve the plans to open up six week consultation when they next meet Shares Get daily news by email Councillor Paul Watson, leader of Sunderland City Council \nThe North East could start consulting on its devolution deal from Tuesday September 6 - if councillors agree with a recommendation put forward by North East Combined Authority officers. \nIn May the seven local authorities - County Durham, Gateshead, Newcastle, North Tyneside, Northumberland, South Tyneside and Sunderland - agreed in principle to push forward with devolution and eventually elect a mayor. \nBut in July the leaders decided to seek assurances from the Government over funding and the requirement for a mayor. \nOn Tuesday, September 6, councillors representing each authority will meet up again to discuss the feedback given to them by Secretary of State for Local Government, Sajid Javid. \nHe confirmed a directly elected mayor is a must for devolution deals, and promised full-funding for existing projects which were set to benefit from European Structural and Investment Funds cash before this year’s Autumn Statement. \nThe Treasury pledged to closely consult with councils on how EU-funded projects will run after Britain leaves the European Union. \nA NECA report recommends that leaders open up a six-week consultation on the Governance Review and Scheme, which sets out how the North East can benefit from devolution and greater self-governance. \nThe report says: “A summary of the consultation responses will be forwarded to the Department for Communities and Local Government at the conclusion of the consultation exercise.” Read More \nLast week, ECA chairman Councillor and Sunderland leader Paul Watson, said: “The talks were positive and the next step will be to go back to our respective cabinets and decide if we should move to public consultation or not. \n“This won’t be a referendum, but it will be a wide spread public consultation.” \nHe added: “People don’t want more votes, more politics another trip to the ballot box. \n“There is apathy growing against that, look at the turn out figures for local election or for the PCC elections.” \nThe £3.4bn deal had been on hold since Britain voted to leave the EU in June, as the leaders were not sure if Brexit and changes to Government cabinet portfolio would affect the devolution offer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-08-30T12:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-08-30T07:59:38.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
