Both LSE and Deutsche Borse have received the blessing of shareholders for the tie-up, but the deal faces a number of regulatory hurdles and the merger has been complicated by Britain’s decision to quit the European Union. \nThe pair moved quickly to assuage any fears that the referendum result would scupper the deal, but the LSE warned on Thursday that Brexit could have a detrimental effect on its business. \nThe LSE said: \nWhilst the group has a global footprint and is well diversified from a geographic and product perspective, there are risks associated with the uncertainty in the UK and the potential impact across Europe. \nThe uncertainty or the outcome may erode investors’ confidence and impact primary and secondary market volumes, assets-based fees and clearing volumes in the UK. \nThe group added that the possibility of future referendums across Europe could lead to volatility in the foreign exchange markets and interest rates. \nChief executive Xavier Rolet said the LSE is “well-positioned to navigate political and macroeconomic changes”.

Eileen Naughton, MD of Google UK and Ireland, at Newcastle City Library 9.05 Coreena Ford Tax avoidance - what the charities say. . . \nCharities have called on Prime Minister Theresa May to take action on tax avoidance. \nActionAid’s Barry Johnston said: \nThe new Prime Minister has said she will take on corporate tax avoidance. \nShe’d do well to heed the recommendations of this far-sighted report as the UK redefines its global position. \nWe urge the Prime Minister to take bold action to tackle British overseas tax havens, end the race to the bottom on corporate tax rates and stop companies artificially shifting profits around the world. \nThis September’s G20 meeting in China - May’s first major summit as PM - provides the perfect opportunity for her to show she means business. \nOxfam’s Sally Copley said: \nThe Prime Minister must go further than the previous government if she is to fulfil her ambitions to tackle tax dodging. \nAs a starting point, she should deliver on the report’s recommendations to make the UK’s overseas territories and crown dependencies follow the same rules as the UK itself, and make British companies publish reports on their activities in every country where they operate. \nChristian Aid’s Toby Quantrill said: \nThis cross-party report is a gift to the government of Theresa May, who has criticised multinational tax cheats and said she wants to tackle corporate irresponsibility of the sort exemplified by British Home Stores. \nTheresa May’s Government must prove it takes this issue seriously by adopting the proposals in today’s report in full, and following through with determination. 9.01 Coreena Ford Government facing both ways on tax avoidance, MPs claim \nBritain has been a “difficult friend” of global efforts to tackle tax avoidance by multinational companies like Google, a cross-party group of MPs has said. The all party parliamentary group on responsible tax, which is headed up by influential Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge, called on the Treasury to annually assess the effect of cutting the corporation tax rate and introducing tax reliefs on avoidance. \nDame Margaret also described as “frustrating” the Government’s failure to make overseas territories and crown dependencies, many of which are tax havens, follow Britain’s lead in publishing company beneficial ownership registers. \nThis failure to introduce full transparency undermines the OECD’s (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) plan to tackle profit shifting - when companies shift their profits to low tax or no tax jurisdictions in order to avoid levies, the MPs said. \nBritain has publicly led on this work while undermining its effectiveness behind the scenes by defending schemes such as patent box relief, which has now been modified in response to concerns, but copied by other countries such as Ireland in a “race to the bottom”, their report said. \nDame Margaret said: \nThe Government has been facing both ways. \nWhile publicly proclaiming their determination to tackle global tax avoidance, they have been encouraging these practices by changes they have made to the UK tax system and by refusing privately to agree to some key OECD proposals. \nTheir unwillingness to get tough on our overseas territories and crown dependencies, home to a number of tax havens, by forcing them to introduce public registers of beneficial ownership is frustrating. \nThe new Prime Minister must put an end to tax secrecy. The UK Government should take a leading role and introduce public country-by-country reporting. \nThe UK Government should use the law to end the secrecy that encompasses tax havens. \nThe Government should work internationally to create rules that are sustainable and that ensure tax is properly paid where value is actually added. 8.58 Coreena Ford FTSE latest and Pound update \nThe pound at 8am was 1.3289 dollars compared to 1.3333 dollars at the previous close.

Statutory pre-tax profits tumbled from £255.4 million to £139.6 million in the first six months of the year, with the company taking a £112.3 million hit from an early redemption of historic debt. \nChief executive Evelyn Bourke said: \nGlobally, corporate oil and gas contracts have suffered as a result of the falling oil price, resulting in reduced revenues and profits. \nWhile oil and gas firms still see the benefit of having cover for employees, they are reducing some of the benefits. \nOil prices have plunged over the past 18 months, and Bupa’s business in Saudi Arabia was particularly affected. \nThe firm said: “Some corporate clients have faced economic pressures, particularly in the oil and gas sector, reducing the corporate and SME (small and medium enterprises) books. \nThis has had a significant impact on earned revenue in some regions and remains a key area of focus for 2016.” \nNevertheless, revenue was up 7% to £5.3 billion on a constant currency basis with Bupa, which operates globally, benefiting from the fall in sterling. Underlying pre-tax profits were up 2% to £261.7 million in the period. \nMs Bourke, who was appointed chief executive in April, added that she plans to refresh Bupa’s strategy under her leadership. \nThe focus will be on the customer experience, building loyalty and digital. \nWe will also continue to expand selectively in markets where we see the most opportunity - China, the Middle East, the UK and North America. \nBupa covers 32 million customers in 190 countries, running hospitals, care homes and health insurance schemes. \nThe chief executive said the firm, which operates 283 homes and 27 retirement villages in the UK, remains “committed” to the care home sector. \nHowever, she warned that in the face of falling local authority fees and rising costs, Bupa would close homes that were no longer sustainable. \nWe are in active negotiations with local authorities to ensure their fees reflect the true cost of care. \nWe have been prepared to close homes in the past and we will again if they are not sustainable. \nThe care sector has been vocal about the impact of the National Living Wage on profitability. \nOn Brexit, Ms Bourke said that Bupa will look to mitigate any impact through enhancing the customer experience. \nShe added: \nThe immediate impact on Bupa’s financial position following the EU referendum in June has been limited. While there will be some operational and legal impacts, it is too early to conclude how the Leave vote will affect our underlying businesses and employees. We will continue to monitor the situation closely. Bupa has seen half-year profits slump 45% 8.45 Coreena Ford 'Bookie friendly' Ladbrokes drives £25m profit \nLadbrokes hailed the “sporting gods” as the bookmaker moved back into the black in the first half of the year, helped by England’s embarrassing exit from Euro 2016. \nThe betting firm notched up statutory pre-tax profits of £25.2 million in the six months to the end of June, compared with a £51.4 million loss in the same period last year. \nRevenue also rose 12% to £661.8 million as the firm recovered from what it described as the worst Cheltenham “in living memory” earlier in the year. Ladbrokes said it avoided “significant liabilities” as a result of the home nations crashing out of the Uefa European Championship early, with the exception of Wales. \nMinnows Iceland knocked England out of the tournament, despite the odds being well against them. \nBoss Jim Mullen said: \nThese strong numbers show customers are responding positively to the new strategy at a time when the sporting gods have generally been on our side and we’ve enjoyed some helpful bookmaker-friendly results. \nThis combination has helped boost profits in the first half of the year. \nThe company added: “The bookie-friendly results of football helped to offset the worst Cheltenham Festival on record and a very customer-friendly Royal Ascot.” \nLadbrokes is also in the midst of a £2.3 billion merger with Gala Coral, and the firm said its financial performance positions it well for the tie-up. Last month the Competition and Markets Authority ordered the pair to offload 350 to 400 high street stores as a condition of the deal. 8.40 Coreena Ford Resilient pet market boosts Pets at Home \nPets At Home put faith in the “resilience” of the pet market to see it through economic woes after the Brexit vote as it posted a pick-up in sales growth. \nThe Cheshire-based chain - which runs 431 stores across the UK as well as 391 veterinary practices - said like-for-like sales lifted 2.7% in its first quarter to July 21. \nIt hailed the firm’s growing veterinary and pet grooming services and said demand for advanced nutrition products for pets was also a key driver behind the sales rise. \nThe sales growth marks a sharp increase on a year earlier, when sales lifted 1.7%, and a rise on the previous three months. \nRecently-appointed chief executive Ian Kellett said he was “pleased with our positive start to the year”. \nHe added: \nWhilst the consumer outlook is uncertain, we remain confident in our long-term strategy and are reassured by the historical resilience of the pet market in times of economic downturn. Pablo the rabbit, who is up for adoption at a Pets at Home branch 8.35 Coreena Ford The effects of low interest rates - on savers and borrowers \nFor savers, halving the rate means nearly three-quarters of current accounts on the market now pay a zero rate of in-credit interest. \nMoneyfacts.co.uk recently found that around 72% of current account deals do not offer an interest rate on credit balances, although some of these could offer other “perks” such as cashback. \nThe average “no notice” Isa interest rate on offer is less than 1%. \nA typical no-notice Isa on the market in August was paying 0.95%, according to Moneyfacts. A year ago, the average rate was 1.11%. \nFor every savings rate that has been increased in 2016, around nine have been cut, Moneyfacts’ data shows. \nFor borrowers, more than two million recent home buyers are likely never to have experienced a hike to their mortgage rates, having got on the property ladder while rates were static or falling. \nA spate of mortgage price wars has pushed rates to record lows. Notable deals launched recently include a two-year fixed rate from HSBC at 0.99%. \nAs well as rates, mortgage lenders have also been getting more competitive with the fees that come with their deals - with growing numbers of fee-free offers. \nBorrowers can now choose from more than 1,200 mortgage deals with no arrangement fee, according to Moneyfacts, up from just over 500 two years ago. \nTraditionally, lowering of interest rates means lower borrowing costs for businesses too, and this must be one of the main drivers for this proposed cut - a move which is designed to encourage businesses to borrow and grow, through recruitment and investment. How will the 0.25% interest rates cut affect you? 8.30 Coreena Ford Top story - Bank of England to push the button on interest rates cut \nThe Bank of England is expected to push the button on the first cut in interest rates for more than seven years as the economy falters in the wake of the Brexit vote. \nEconomists predict that policymakers on the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will vote to slash rates to a new historic low in an effort to ward off the threat of recession. \nBen Brettell, senior economist at Hargeaves Lansdown, said it was “almost certain” that rates will be cut, with financial markets pricing in a reduction from 0.5% to 0.25%. \nPolicymakers may also look to use other economy-boosting measures, possibly firing up the money-printing presses once more to expand its £375 billion quantitative easing programme. \nA rate cut would be the first since March 2009, when the Bank slashed rates to the all-time emergency low of 0.5% at the height of the financial crisis. It would be good news for borrowers, but spell further misery for long-suffering savers. \nThe Bank of England has repeatedly signalled that measures to bolster the economy are on the way, saying at its last interest rate decision that most MPC members expected to take action in August. \nBank governor Mark Carney signalled in the wake of the Brexit vote that rates would come down in July or August and the MPC surprised economists and investors when it kept rates on hold last month. \nWhile last week’s gross domestic product (GDP) figures estimated a better-than-expected 0.6% rise in the second quarter, this is expected to have gone into sharp reverse since the Brexit vote. \nClosely-watched purchasing managers’ index (PMI) surveys on the three major sectors of the economy pointed to a record fall in activity last month and raised recession fears. \nThe readings signalled a shock contraction in the dominant services sector for the first time since the end of 2012 and the biggest monthly fall in activity on record. \nThe all-sector PMI suggested a 0.4% fall in GDP in the third quarter. \nMarkit chief economist Chris Williamson warned the result “undoubtedly” raised the risk of a mild technical recession - two quarters in a row of falling GDP. A report from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) also cautioned that there was a 50/50 chance of a recession over the next 18 months. \nJack Meaning, a research fellow at NIESR, said the Bank needs to use a “sledgehammer” to offset a deepening downturn in the economy. \nThe Bank’s latest forecasts due to be published in its quarterly inflation report, which will be published alongside its interest rate decision, will be scoured for signs of recession. \nMr Carney warned in May that a Brexit vote could trigger a recession and has since said many of the risks previously flagged up have begun to “crystallise”. Financial markets have been surprisingly resilient, but the pound has plunged in value, consumer confidence has fallen sharply and there are signs of strain in commercial and residential property markets.
