R 09:24 Robert Gibson-NEC Teesside partnership completes work at Riverside Stadium \nA Teesside partnership has completed a major project at Middlesbrough FC’s Riverside Stadium after diversifying from the offshore industry due to the downturn in the oil and gas sector. \nMacdonald Offshore Solutions and its sister company Protective Systems worked to a tight deadline to manufacture and install an imposing new stair tower and television gantry in time for the club’s long-awaited return to the Premier League. \nThe project, worth more than £300,000 to the Yarm businesses, also included the construction of new Sky Sports TV single camera points and modifications to the West Stand press gantry and hanging camera gantries around the stadium. \nFellow directors Steve Macdonald and Stephen Osbaldeston, former primary school classmates and lifelong Boro supporters, say the project was the most prestigious the firm had carried out since launching two years ago. \n“With such a tight deadline to fit in with football’s close season, this was the most challenging project we’ve undertaken,” said Mr Macdonald. \n“But it was also the most rewarding and satisfying. \n“As lifelong Middlesbrough supporters, we were over the moon to be involved with a project of such prestige on behalf of our club, knowing that 30,000 people will be able to admire our work at every home match. \n“It’s very special to think that our legacy will remain long after Aitor Karanka and the current stars have left the club.” Macdonald Offshore Solutions and its sister company Protective Systems have completed a new project at Middlesbrough FC's Riverside Stadium.

We need a return to proper year-on-year pay rises, and a higher national minimum wage.“And we need public investment in major infrastructure projects to create more well-paid jobs and build a stronger economy.“The Government must also do more to help low-income families struggling with problem debt in getting access to debt restructuring and insolvency support.” 09:04 Robert Gibson-NEC Kiln dried log business expands after funding \nFunding recently approved by the North East Rural Growth Network has enabled kiln dried log business, Woodfuel Barn in High Spen, Gateshead, to expand its existing site. \nThe Rural Business Growth Fund, which is designed to provide support to grow small businesses looking for capital investment, awarded Woodfuel Barn £20,442 in April 2016 to construct a 1000 square metre log seasoning shed on the site of their existing business. \nThis recent expansion will create three more jobs for the company. \nWoodfuel Barn sell Quality Assured kiln dried logs to over 1000 customers in the North East region and also on a national scale. \nThe now-completed project has allowed director, Peter Stenner, to increase his production capability by continuous rotation of stock. \nHe said: “Getting the grant from the Rural Business Growth Fund was a vital step to our development. \n“The grant process was competitive so we were really pleased to be selected”. “The log seasoning process is an essential part of providing our customers with the quality products.

Yet despite growing numbers of older and younger workers, the value of a multigenerational workforce to business is little understood.“As these insights show, teams that bring together a mix of people of different ages and at different life stages are fundamental to creating a happy and motivated workplace and to delivering a great customer experience.” 08:55 Robert Gibson-NEC Rank shrugs off Brexit hit to pound as profits rise 15% Mecca Bingo operator Rank Group says it will be unaffected by Brexit.

Last year, it racked up a £3.4 million loss on sales of £19.3 million.The deal to sell the business was struck under former Asda boss Andy Clarke, who has since been replaced by Sean Clarke.Photo-Me chief executive Serge Crasnianski said: “This is an interesting opportunity to significantly expand our UK business in a strong set of locations and increase our market share in the digital photo printing market, which we believe has growth potential in the digital age.”Mr Crasnianski added that he aims to “improve the level of trading and overall performance over the next two years and beyond”.Last week, Asda laid bare the challenge awaiting Mr Clarke after reporting its worst quarterly performance on record. The chain - owned by US giant Walmart - posted a 7.5% fall in like-for-like sales in the second quarter.In June, Photo-Me International said it captured a rise in full-year profits, helped by the introduction of a new Japanese identity card.Pre-tax profits rose 4.1% to £40.1 million while revenues were boosted 3.8% to £184 million as the firm also hailed the perforrmance of its Revolution self-service laundry machines.
