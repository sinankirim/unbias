Once completed, it will be worth just shy of £2.5 million. \nIn two weeks, Silvan Floors will also be opening a showroom in Fraser Street, downtown Vancouver, with carpet firm Burritt Brothers. Richard said: \"We've started to do more exporting and with the new shop in Vancouver, we've got a contract in place for the Burritt Brothers to sell our products on our behalf. \n\"We're currently working on projects in Hong Kong and Athens and we are going to do the floors for the Columbus Monte Carlo hotel in Monaco, which was previously owned by Formula One driver David Coulthard.\" \nRead more: Petition to save Vaughan Centre at University of Leicester signed by 3,000 \nJames added: \"We're one of three or four companies in the world that do what we can do so we're getting a lot of interest from America in places such as Los Angeles and Boston. \n\"We're now manufacturing for a large German company – so we've gone from manufacturing and importing in Germany to exporting for a large company out there.\" \nThe directors said they aren't too concerned about the Brexit vote and are aiming to grow the export side of the business.James said: \"We're hoping to double our export market in the next 12 months. \n\"We're looking at Brexit in a positive manner. We're a proud British manufacturer and have become a part of the Make It British campaign. \n\"We're winning contracts because we're British.
