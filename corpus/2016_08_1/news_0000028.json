The work with which we have been involved includes a high proportion of foreign investment; and Britain remains one of the most attractive destinations for investors. \n\"It will be interesting to see whether this continues into Q4 but the signs are looking favourable. We anticipate that firms will be left feeling more encouraged to make investment decisions and things will only continue to improve as market volatility settles and more buying opportunities emerge.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-08-31T22:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-08-31T19:59:01.236+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
