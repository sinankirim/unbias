And, as MARK LANE reports, it's not all doom and gloom Shares Get business news by email \nIn the immediate wake of the positive Brexit vote , there was an undoubted sense of ‘be careful what you wish for’, with even some of the most ardent of Brexit supporters no doubt quietly concerned about the economic repercussions of a vote which they – quite possibly - never truly believed would come to pass. \nThe financial markets went into meltdown for a short period, UK sterling plummeted and big business heads made noises about whether remaining in the UK was in their best interests. \nNow that this immediate panic has calmed down, here in the North East at least there is an overwhelming sense ‘what was all the fuss about’? Indeed, some of the businesses we spoke to for this feature were at pains to point out that far from leading to economic Armageddon, leaving the EU might be beneficial to UK businesses. \nKeen ‘Leave’ supporter, John Elliott, chairman of Ebac, certainly falls into this category. \nEbac has been one of the region’s most successful manufacturing and exporting businesses for more than two decades and, as such, Elliott’s views are not to be discarded lightly. John Elliott, chairman of Ebac, was a keen supporter of the Leave campaign \nElliott told us he wants to see two changes in government policy, both of which are possible after Brexit. \nThese are to “stop being fearful of tariffs with the EU because they make manufacturing in the UK a better proposition,” and to “start offering direct support to home grown manufacturers by way of easements on costs such as rates, energy and employment”. \nHe said: “Tariffs are a double-edged sword and because we import more from the EU than we export to it the effect of tariffs will favour UK manufacturers over EU manufacturers. \n“The tariffs that are added to EU-made goods will mean the UK consumer will have to pay more but the effect on the overall economy is neutralised because the tariffs are paid to the UK exchequer. This revenue could be used for example to reduce VAT. \n“The effect of this tariff will make UK manufactured goods more attractive and should help to kick start the growth of UK manufacturing.” \nElliott thinks Brexit could be used as a catalyst to get behind UK manufacturing. \nHe added: “Successive governments have allowed manufacturing to decline or pass into the hands of foreign companies. If we added positive government action to the benefits of tariffs on EU goods, we can achieve even more growth in our once strong economy. For too long British governments have played lip service to bringing our external trade into balance and they’ve accepted our deficit as normal paying for it by selling our valuable assets. \n“The fundamental problem of our trade deficit is very simple; we consume more than we produce. This being the problem the solution is also very simple, consume less or produce more or both. \n“Printing money, keeping interest rates low has not worked. How could it be the solution? We need structural change rather than fiddling around the edges. \n“Brexit gives us the opportunity to do things differently and if we don’t make changes, things will stay the same. The recession in 2008 was not an act of God, it was caused by mismanagement of central bankers and others. Eight years later things are not a lot better. We must question the status quo. First and foremost, we need an industrial strategy.” From left, principal and chief executive of Gateshead College Judith Doyle,Smith Electric Vehicle apprentice Kristian Jones and managing director of Hyperdrive Innovation, Stephen Irish \nStephen Irish, CEO of Sunderland-based Hyperdrive Innovation is another who has strong views about Brexit – and who doesn’t necessarily see it as the end of the world. \nHyperdrive makes lithium-ion batteries for vehicle electrification and energy storage and has formed a multi-million pound partnership with Nissan to produce batteries for third parties such as other car marques, driverless vehicles, industrial vehicles and even homes. \nIt is one of 240 companies which make up the North East Automotive Alliance and export over £5.1bn annually. \nIn spite of the Brexit result, Stephen is optimistic about the prospects of Hyperdrive and other exporters in the North East. \nHe told us: “It is fair to say that Brexit – with its potential impact on the open market – isn’t something the British car industry wanted, especially at a time when the automotive industry has just hit levels of production last seen in 2005. \n“I was certainly in favour of staying in but now that Brexit’s happened, I think companies just have to get on with it. Manufacturers like us need to just crack on and start thinking about how they are going to respond to the challenge.” \nIs he concerned about the company’s work with Nissan for the long-term? Answering this, he told us: “No – I haven’t been given any reason to be concerned. I do believe though that the UK government needs to continue to work to make sure the North East remains attractive to car makers. British engineering needs to be recognised as world-leading by companies and car buyers overseas. \n“Nissan’s Sunderland plant is one of the best in Europe and it’s critical to local employment and business. \n\"While the majority of the North East voted for Brexit, few would vote for Nissan to move on, because it helps to sustain the local economy.” \nThe anecdotal evidence cited above is supported from broader industry polls which suggest businesses are, in the main, getting on with it – although a poll by the EEF, the engineering manufacturing trade body, suggests there is some concern. \nThe research suggested that the Brexit vote had bruised manufacturers’ confidence, but firms expect real risks to manifest over the next six months to a year, with most companies expecting trading conditions over the next six months to weaken. \nLooking at the immediate impact, the findings reveal small balances of firms reporting decreases in UK order volumes (7%), EU export order volumes (8%) and their inquiry pipeline (8%). EEF'S Liz Mayes \nConversely, a balance of 2% have seen non-EU exports increase. \nOver 80% of manufacturers, however, said their order intake is unchanged or it’s too soon to say what the impact has been. \nBut while the immediate picture looks promisingly steady, the same cannot be said of the outlook in six months’ time. Demand conditions in the next six months are expected to be weaker. The biggest concern appears to be demand from UK customers, with almost three in ten firms (29%) bracing themselves for UK orders to decline. \nEU orders are also at risk, with a balance of 12% of companies predicting a decline, exactly matched by those expecting non-EU orders to increase. \nThe survey shows that confidence for the 12 months ahead has tumbled, both in terms of firms’ faith in the UK economy and in their own business performance. Undoubtedly, this has been driven by the broad range of risks manufacturers have identified for the year ahead. \nLiz Mayes, North East region director, said: “Rather than an immediate storm, it is clear that manufacturers see the real risks from the referendum outcome presenting over the next six months to a year. \n“While many are acutely aware that we are still in the early days, exchange rate volatility, political uncertainty and the danger of increased costs are already on their risk radar and subsequently we can already see confidence starting to drain away. \n“The post-referendum drop in the value of sterling has been helpful to some manufacturers, but the overall impact is too nuanced for it to be glibly hailed as the hero of the piece. \n“The opportunities it presents must be weighed against the three quarters of manufacturers who see exchange rate volatility as a key risk in the next 12 months and the third of firms that have already seen input costs rise. \n“In the next six months, over half of manufacturers expect input prices to increase and that probably tells you everything about why the drop in sterling is a double-edged sword.” \nFinally, we asked Ross Smith, director of policy, North East England Chamber of Commerce, about the general take among the region’s Chamber members. \nSmith told us: “The polls clearly showed the result was going to be on a knife edge so like the rest of the population it was not a huge shock to members although our research showed more of them would have preferred to remain. \n“Very few members have seen an impact as yet but there is one isolated incident where a country seemed to change its requirements after the vote decision. Overwhelmingly there appears to be no major difference and we don’t expect to see any for some time. \n“The pound falling has obviously helped some exporters. We have heard that some customers are taking a wait and see approach to potential deals. It is reassuring a Cabinet level appointment has been made to manage the process of change. \n“We hope not only are our EU relations protected but our links with the rest of the world are strengthened.” AN EXPERT'S VIEW \nWilliam Bain, head of the Brexit Advisory Unit, Inline Policy, comments on North East businesses and how Brexit will have a significant impact on local export markets: \n“Unless we stay fully within the Single Market, the UK will need to export more goods to the EU and new markets and depend less on services to generate future growth and jobs. \n“The key priority for exporting companies and workers through the negotiations process will be to ensure Government can put in place durable trade and investment arrangements with the continuing member states taking effect on the date we leave the EU. \n“Guaranteeing that goods can be traded tariff free and with the least onerous additional customs and supply chain restrictions with the EU market is vital for manufacturing jobs in the North East. \n“To support the region, it is absolutely critical that the Government brings forward a strong and regionally balanced industrial and skills strategy to support new investment and finance for manufacturing both at home and from overseas. \n“Many small and medium sized businesses in the North East have benefited from specific EU support funding, so clarity on what will replace that is vital for sustaining employment and growth.\" \nThe Brexit Advisory Unit works with organisations to advise on policy and regulatory implications of the EU withdrawal process.
