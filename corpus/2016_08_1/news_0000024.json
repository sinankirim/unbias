Bargain stores such as Poundland and B&M saw a 17% rise in sales in the year to July, according to data by Nielsen retail performance, underscoring the fierce competition in Britain's grocery sector. \nI'll be here until 9.30am and I'll take you through the events to keep you informed as they break, and give you a flavour of what to expect from us news-wise over the course of the day. \nIf you'd like to contribute to the live blog, tweet at @jnlbusiness to share your stories, opinions and images. \nAlternatively you can drop me a line at robert.gibson@ncjmedia.co.uk or tweet me at @JournalGibson Key Events So Far 09:04 Robert Gibson-NEC Ambitious plans announced for Newcastle's Northumberland St \nPlans to make Newcastle’s Northumberland Street one of the best shopping areas in Europe are being put together, with businesses and people in the city being invited to get involved. \nNewcastle City Council and business improvement group NE1 Ltd will be holding a meeting in September which aims to kick off a process of making major improvements to the city’s main shopping street. \nThe two organisations have signed up Government high street tzar Mark Williams to lead the project and say they want to emulate upmarket shopping areas like London’s Regent Street, Boulevard Anspach in Brussels and the Neuer Wall area of Hamburg. \nFull story here: http://bit.ly/2bnnzkI 08:55 Robert Gibson-NEC 'New Hinkley Point power station not essential for UK to meet energy targets' \nThe UK can meet its energy and climate change targets without building the controversial new Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, a new report has found.The Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) said building more wind farms and gas-fired power stations combined with measures to manage demand could save £1 billion a year “while keeping the lights on and meeting climate targets”.The findings come after Prime Minister Theresa May delayed approving the power station in Somerset amid concerns about China’s involvement.The unexpected move came just hours after French energy giant EDF had approved the project, and plunged its future into doubt.The Government is expected to make a final decision on Hinkley Point - which would be Britain’s first nuclear power plant in a generation - in September.ECIU director Richard Black said the report - Hinkley What If? - shows the nuclear plant “is not essential”.He said: “Despite years of debate on Hinkley, we’re still not sure whether or not it’s going to get built - the Prime Minister is due to make a decision next month, but even if she says ‘yes’ there are many other issues that could derail the project, including legal cases and EDF’s financial woes.“So we wanted to know how essential Hinkley is for the ‘energy trilemma’ - keeping the lights on whilst cutting greenhouse gas emissions and keeping costs down.“Our conclusion is that it’s not essential; using tried and tested technologies, with nothing unproven or futuristic, Britain can meet all its targets and do so at lower cost.” 08:44 Robert Gibson-NEC Consumer confidence sees fastest monthly rise in three years \nConsumer confidence has risen at its fastest monthly rate in three-and-a-half years as Brexit jitters ease, a survey has found.In a dramatic turnaround from last month, the YouGov/Cebr Consumer Confidence Index has seen its highest monthly bounce since February 2013 of 3.2 points to 109.8.The poll reveals significant increases in people’s expectations for their household financial situations and property values over the coming year.Only one measure - job security in the year ahead - has fallen slightly in the last month.All four measures looking back over the past 30 days have improved - household financial situation, property value, job security and business activity in the workplace.August’s rise follows July’s sharp fall to the index’s lowest point in three years following the vote to leave the EU.But despite the strong improvement it has only recovered around half of the ground it lost in the wake of the referendum.Cebr director Scott Corfe said: “This month’s improvement in consumer confidence follows positive news from other areas of the economy and slightly punctures the arguments of those who predicted immediate economic Armageddon following a Brexit vote.“With consumer confidence rising and year-on-year retail sales up it is evident that the public have yet to feel many - if any - effects from the vote to leave the EU.”But he warned: “Both inflation and unemployment are low, for now, which is undoubtedly supporting consumer optimism.“However, this could easily change next year as the weakness of sterling pushes up the cost of imports.“2017 could be the year that consumers stumble.”Stephen Harmston, head of YouGov Reports, said: “For all the talk of doom and gloom - both in the months leading up to the referendum and in the days following it - most consumers have yet to feel much tangible impact of the vote to leave the EU.“It is clear that the panic that gripped the public in the immediate aftermath of the referendum has subsided as institutions like the Bank of England take decisive action and the result becomes a part of life.“Of course, everything could change once details of the deal to leave the EU emerge and the process of extracting ourselves from the EU becomes a reality.” 08:35 Robert Gibson-NEC First-time shoppers boost takings at budget retailers \nBudget retailers have bolstered their takings by nearly a fifth to £4.9bn as millions of first-time shoppers flock to their stores, a new report has revealed.Bargain stores such as Poundland and B&M saw a 17% rise in sales in the year to July, according to data by Nielsen retail performance, underscoring the fierce competition in Britain’s grocery sector.The increasing threat from budget retailers to the Big Four supermarkets comes as more than 2.2m households bought from a bargain store for the first time in the past year, with 52% shopping at Poundland.The growth was partly driven by the sale of fruit and vegetables, which have seen the biggest rise in popularity out of all the products on offer at budget stores - albeit from a low base.The jump comes after Home Bargains began selling potatoes, carrots and onions. Around 78% of households in Britain have now shopped at a budget store, making them more popular than German discounters Aldi and Lidl, which are visited by three quarters of households, the report added. Mike Watkins, Nielsen’s UK head of retailer and business insight, said spending growth was mainly driven by a huge rise in first-time visitors and more customers buying products at budget stores that they would normally have purchased at the supermarket.“People are starting to visit for their regular grocery staples and more experienced bargain store shoppers are becoming interested in adding fresh produce to their repertoire,” he added.“This is similar to what we saw some years ago with Aldi and Lidl, who initially attracted shoppers with special buys for non-food items and low prices on groceries.”The rise in sales also came from bargain stores “removing the £1 straitjacket” and offering more expensive products, the report said. It added that around 31% of the increased annual amount British shoppers spent at bargain stores came from people shifting spending away from supermarkets and health and beauty retailers. The Big Four grocers accounted for 73% of spend shifted away towards bargain stores.The British grocery sector continues to be locked in a supermarket price war, which has seen the supermarket giants slash their prices to protect market share from the rise of Aldi and Lidl.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-08-26T15:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-08-26T11:11:04.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
