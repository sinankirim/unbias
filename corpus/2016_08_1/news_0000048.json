We are working hard to mitigate these cuts, shielding the vulnerable and investing in our city. But this is increasingly difficult as the impact of these cuts over the last six years is being felt right across our city.” \nNorthumberland is also in the national top 10, with spending set to drop by £19.56 per head. \nWhile Sunderland will lose £17.22 per head, County Durham £15.10, South Tyneside £14.45, Redcar and Cleveland £11.79 and Gateshead £9.76. \nStockton-on-Tees will be down £8.46 per head and North Tyneside just £7.75 per head. Councillor Grant Davey \nNorthumberland County Council leader Grant Davey said the rural authority struggles to cope with spending cuts of £58m over the next few years especially when offset against the cost of services in rural areas. \nCoun Davey said: “These figures show a dramatic drop in spending power over the past year and highlights the challenges we face as a rural council. \n“We continue to call on the government to recognise our challenges as it carries out its review into the future of council funding. \n“By 2020 Northumberland will receive £6.85 per head for residents compared to over £66 in metropolitan areas, despite the cost of delivering services in the countryside being three times more costly. Even more astounding is our nearest neighbours in the Scottish Borders due to get £1,400 per head in the next four years.” Read More Northumberland council chiefs criticised for splashing £78m on shopping centre amid cuts \nDurham County Council is on target to have cut spending by a massive £245m between 2011 and 2020, and council leader Simon Henig fears more cuts are to come following Brexit. \nHe said: “We continue to face the toughest of times and many significant uncertainties, including the impact of leaving the European Union which is still unknown.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-08-20T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-08-20T20:10:30.269+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
