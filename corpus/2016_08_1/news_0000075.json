Carbonated drinks surrounded by sugar cubes \n“Those problems live with the children forever, and not only is that bad for their long term health but it also costs the state a lot more money in healthcare. \n“We already have a £5 billion bill every year for diabetes and complex problems that can follow on from this horrible, chronic disease.” \nShe said that she knew from experience with her own children that advertising encouraged them to demand unhealthy food. \n“I have always felt that advertising for things that are really bad for children’s health should not be on our screens and creating difficult choices for parents when they do their weekly shop.” \nThe strategy includes a sugar tax on soft drinks such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Red Bull, which will come into force from 2018. \nPrimary schools are being asked to help ensure that pupils get at least 60 minutes of exercise a day including 30 minutes in school through PE and active play and 30 minutes outside school. \nAnd a new voluntary “healthy schools rating scheme” will be taken into account during school inspections. \nMinisters also hope the food industry will cut 20% of sugar from the products children enjoy such as cereals, yoghurts, sweets, breads and desserts over the next five years, with a 5% cut in the first year. \nPublic Health England will set targets for sugar content in products such as breakfast cereals, yoghurts, biscuits, cakes, confectionery, pastries, puddings, ice cream and sweet spreads, and eventually for other foods too. \nBut if the food industry doesn’t act voluntarily, the strategy states that the Government will consider “whether alternative levers need to be used” - suggesting that legislation is possible. Anthony Devlin/PA Wire Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver \nJamie Oliver criticised the plan as “underwhelming” and “far from robust... with so much missing”. \nCouncillor Jane Streather, Newcastle’s Cabinet Member for Public Health, said: “Obesity is a big and growing problem which really should be the Government’s number one public health priority. \n“The Government has had the chance to take effective action on a number of fronts and failed on each and every one of them. Quite simply it’s a missed opportunity. \n“The funding for sport is nothing new and the so called sugar tax is vague and will probably only scratch at the surface of what is a public health challenge for children, adults and the NHS. \n“I don’t believe that voluntary agreements with the food industry will work when what we really need is regulation of advertising, food content and an environment that challenges obesity by encouraging more healthy lifestyles. \n“In Newcastle we are doing a lot to tackle obesity by working with our partners but we can’t do it in isolation. We need a regulatory framework and a national plan that takes a multi-faceted approach to this.” PA Wire Jane Ellison speaks in the House of Commons \nFinancial Secretary to the Treasury Jane Ellison denied that the Prime Minister had removed the strongest proposals, amid reports that she wanted to spare businesses from new restrictions during post-Brexit uncertainty. \nResponding to claims that the childhood obesity strategy was a priority for David Cameron but not his successor Mrs May, she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “No, that’s not right. \n“One of the problems about having at the heart of the plan this reformulation strategy, let’s be honest, is it is quite technical. \n“It’s not as iconic, for example, as talking about everyday things that everyone understands around advertising but it is nonetheless the thing that every expert, not just in this country but around the world, recommends as the most effective. \n“It feeds into everything else, it feeds through into advertising, and promotions.” \nShe added: “We’ve looked at a whole range of policies over the past year, this is the plan that we’re putting forward, it’s a cross-Government plan.” \nSupermarket Sainsbury’s called for tougher measures. Sainsbury’s chief executive Mike Coupe said: “This is a welcome first step, but we need a holistic approach to tackle childhood obesity, including compulsory measured targets across all nutrients - not just sugar - and mandatory traffic light labelling across all food and drink products, regardless of whether they are consumed inside or outside the home.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-08-19T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-08-18T20:50:19.610+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
