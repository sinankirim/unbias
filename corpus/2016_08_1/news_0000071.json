The move came soon after Chancellor George Osborne stepped down, leading some to call the future of the powerhouse vision into question, as it had been seen by many as Mr Osborne’s ‘pet project’. \nBut the new minister said the Government is still committed to bringing economic growth in the North in line with that in London and affluent areas of the South East. \nHe said: “The economic potential of the North of England is huge. Investors around the world can already see that for themselves, with foreign direct investment in the area more than doubling over the past two years. \n“But we need to go further. If we can reduce the productivity gap between London and the South East and the rest of the country by half, it could add £150bn to our economy. \n“That’s why we are 100% committed to supporting the northern economy, as part of our wider industrial strategy to deliver an economy that works for everyone across the country.” Video loading Click to play Tap to play The Live Event you are trying to watch is either unavailable or has not started Please refresh this page in your browser to reload this live event video \nThe minister claimed that the recent vote to leave the EU could prove beneficial to the North — despite fears that the move could cost our region huge sums. \nLast month, MPs pointed out that the North East was due to receive almost £800m in European cash, and treasury ministers were forced to admit that Government could not guarantee the region would get comparable funding outside the union. Neil Hall/PA Wire Chancellor George Osborne \nBut Mr Percy said: “The Brexit vote has opened up a world of opportunities for businesses in the North of England and we must seize them to become a great powerhouse of the future.” \nThe MP for Brigg and Goole, in Yorkshire, added: “As Minister for the Northern Powerhouse, and a proud northerner, I can ensure the our voice is heard in the corridors of Whitehall.” \nAnd he insisted that the “key to the North’s success” lay in further devolution. \nThe devolution deal offered to the North East, which would create a mayoral authority in the region and give local politicians great powers over certain areas and funding, is currently on hold.
