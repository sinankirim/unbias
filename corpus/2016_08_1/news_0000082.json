I’ll be back with our blog tomorrow at 8:30am (apologies for the slight delay this morning - technical issues and all that). Stay tuned to http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/business for all the latest North East business news. R 09:25 Robert Gibson-NEC Are vitamin infusions the answer to executive stress? \nOne woman certainly thinks so. \nGill Brooks, of Central Healthcare in Newcastle, says   offers a range of services from colonic irrigation to food intolerance testing - has seen a 30% increase in take-up from high level businesspeople since launching the treatment a year ago. \nMen in their thirties, forties and fifties are the most likely to give it go, she explained, often squeezing in an infusion between meetings, briefings, lunches and hectic business trips. \nRead more about it here http://bit.ly/2bgXa64 ... if you’ve got the energy. Gill Brooks of Central Healthcare 09:20 Robert Gibson-NEC Shopping centres' owner finds rental space unaffected by Brexit \nShopping centre specialist Capital & Regional has said that Britain’s decision to quit the European Union has not affected leasing demand from retail tenants.The asset manager, which owns seven shopping centres in the UK, said that it has experienced “positive leasing momentum since the referendum”, with 29 permanent new leases or renewals exchanged or completed since June 24.The company added that it has seen “little or no reference to Brexit from a pricing perspective” during discussions with occupiers.Chief executive Hugh Scott-Barrett said: “Our letting activity remains robust and, while it is too early to point to any definitive trends, so far we have seen no sign of this abating post the EU referendum.“Furthermore, encouragingly, as markets have stabilised in recent weeks we are seeing a number of opportunities to recycle capital on terms which will enable us to crystallise attractive returns.”Capital & Regional made the announcement alongside its first half results, which saw operating profit tick up from £11.8 million to £13.7 million in the six months to the end of June.However, the firm said it has been stung by the government’s stamp duty land tax to the tune of £10.3 million. 09:15 Robert Gibson-NEC New depot puts Nicholson's on right track \nA LOGISTICS firm’s decision to expand its operations has put the business on the right track. \nNicholson’s Transport opened an additional 15,000sq ft warehouse near Eaglescliffe at the end of 2015 to meet growing demand from customers. \nThe expansion immediately created three new jobs and eased pressure at its existing 55,000sq ft warehouse in Billingham. \nNow, the new facility at the Durham Lane Industrial Estate is employing six staff after building up a strong customer base from firms wishing to outsource their logistics operations. \nManaging director David Nicholsonsaid: “It had been clear for some time that we needed to expand beyond Teesside as we were picking up a lot of business around Darlington and County Durham. \n“It’s an ideal size and in a convenient location for the road networks.We wanted the new site to bed in for a few months but it was vital that we took this decision and it’s very encouraging that we are picking up new customers all the time.” \nA significant part of the warehouse services Nicholson’s pick and pack customers who want to outsource their logistics so they can ship goods quickly around the country without having to open their own warehouse. \nTraders as diverse as bathroom suppliers and crisp and drinks manufacturers to online e-commerce traders have used the service. \nBut now the site is fully operational,Nicholson’s has also started to use it as a logistics hub for transport deliveries across the country. \nMr Nicholsonadded: “Many of our warehouse customers are growing businesses which have lots of stock but neither the time nor the space to be able to manage it effectively, giving it the attention it needs. David Nicholson, MD of Nicholson's Transport 09:10 Robert Gibson-NEC Young jobless most likely to have benefits stopped for breaking rules \nYoung people are more likely to have their out-of-work benefits reduced or stopped for breaking the rules than any other age group, according to a new report.The Policy Exchange think tank said the Government must overhaul the benefits system to help better engage young people in seeking employment. It said official Government data shows people aged 16 to 25 account for over a third (35%) of total sanctions but make up less than a fifth (17%) of total Jobseeker’s Allowance claimants.Sanctions can be handed out for failing to apply for or accept a job, failing to actively seek work and failing to attend a training or employment scheme.In its report, Welfare, Work and Young People, it called for a small number of specialist Youth Employment Centres to be created out of existing Jobcentres to tackle the problem.Steve Hughes, author of the report, said: “All the evidence shows that being in work at a young age has a strong bearing on employment later in life.“That is why the Government should look at changing the way benefits are paid and employment advice is offered to people aged under 25 who are not in work and education.“A dedicated Jobcentre will intensify the level of employment support and advice offered to younger generations during a critical stage of their lives.” 09:05 Robert Gibson-NEC Brexit uncertainty will trigger investment slowdown, says Moody's \nUncertainty surrounding the future of the UK economy outside the European Union will trigger a slowdown in business investment and consumer spending, according to credit ratings agency Moody’s. The group’s quarterly report on the outlook for the global economy said the fallout from the Brexit vote will cause UK investment spending to “weaken considerably” during the second half of this year through to 2017.But it said the plunge in the value of the pound since the EU referendum result will help soften the blow by boosting exports in the short term.The credit ratings agency stood by its previous predictions for UK gross domestic product (GDP) to grow by 1.5% this year and 1.2% in 2017. It said “Brexit-related spillovers” to the eurozone would be limited, but expected some impact to economic growth, pencilling in GDP of 1.5% in 2016 and the 1.3% the year after. 09:00 Robert Gibson-NEC Screwfix drives Kingfisher sales to £3bn as DIY sector holds up after Brexit \nB&Q owner Kingfisher notched up impressive sales growth in the second quarter and said there has been “no clear evidence” of falling demand following the Brexit vote.Like-for-like sales at the DIY specialist rose 3% to £3 billion, driven by strong growth at trade outlet Screwfix.The retail group said like-for-like sales at Screwfix rocketed 13.3% as it benefited from extended ranges and new store openings. Same-store sales at B&Q rose 5.6% in the quarter to July 31.Chief executive Veronique Laury, who is overseeing a turnaround plan at the retailer, said: “We have delivered another solid sales performance in Q2 driven by the UK and Poland.“In the UK, the EU referendum result has created uncertainty for the economic outlook, although there has been no clear evidence of an impact on demand so far on our businesses.” Screwfix has helped Kingfisher drive sales to £3bn 08:55 Robert Gibson-NEC Sweett Group among those to embrace training route \nAmong the North East construction firms following the route recommended by RICS is the Newcastle-based Sweett Group. \nA professional services provider for the construction and management of building and infrastructure projects, the company has won awards for its quantity surveying apprenticeship scheme which has brought a young and diverse group of individuals into the business. \nHR director James Grinnell said: “Our quantity surveying apprenticeship programme enables us to work with local colleges and promote our industry to young people from all backgrounds. \n“We currently have 25 apprentices, with a recruitment strategy aimed at accurately reflecting the diversity of the areas in which we operate.” \nWhen each apprentice joins Sweett Group, they work in a six month rotation in four of its five largest departments – including Commercial, Infrastructure and Public Sector. \nMr Grinnell added: “Each apprentice completes a BTEC in Construction and the Built Environment, over a two year period, with one day per week at college. At the end of the two year apprenticeship, each apprentice is allocated a full-time role in one of our departments.” 08:50 Robert Gibson-NEC Construction firms warned on need for training-based employment \nConstruction firms in the North East must develop more training-based employment programmes for young people if they are to attract the brightest A-level achievers – and help alleviate the skills epidemic in the industry, says the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS). \nIt has been predicted that the UK construction industry will create around 190,000 new jobs by the end of 2018 but there is a growing fear that there will not be the talent to fill them. \nVictoria Hampson, RICS regional director, North & Midlands said: “We have to make it easier for young people to find an appropriate route into the industry, whether that is through apprenticeships or degree-level qualifications. \n“Our research shows that if the skills epidemic doesn’t improve in the next three years, 27,000 planned buildings are at risk of not being built. \n“If we’re to overcome this, we need to reduce the dropout rate from apprenticeships and other training courses by better linking them to the nature of the jobs that are likely to be available, along with relevant qualifications.” \nRICS is working with a number of North East firms, including BAM Construct, CBRE, Carillion, DTZ and Balfour Beatty, to develop a range of Trailblazer apprenticeships which will see apprentices – upon successful completion - gain vocational and academic qualifications. \nMiss Hampson added: “The construction industry looks set to grow over the next five years, but it’s very unlikely that we’ll have the capacity or the capability to fulfil planned projects. We are now calling for employers in the sector to support our work in bringing through the next generation of construction talent.” \nEmployers interested in delivering Trailblazer apprenticeships can find out more at www.apprenticeships.org.uk/standards", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-08-18T15:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-08-18T11:59:23.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
