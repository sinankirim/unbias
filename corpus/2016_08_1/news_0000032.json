The value of deals showed a 19% decrease over the same six month period last year and some of this decrease can be accounted for by fewer mega deals. \nAccording to Dealogic 59 such deals (US$10 bn +) were recorded during 2015 – 24 during the first half of 2015. \nHowever only 16 were recorded globally in the first six months of this year. \nMergermarket recorded the lowest value of European deals since 2013 with values down 19.3% on the same period last year which once again can be explained by the decrease in number of megadeals as deal volumes increased by almost 20% to 3,110. \nThe top targeted nation in Europe was the UK although activity dropped in the second quarter as the date of the referendum moved closer. \nA total of 647 deals targeting UK companies were announced during the first half of 2016, a drop of 8% on the same period the previous year but more significantly the value of announced deals decreased by 66% to £41.3bn. \nA similar pattern was recorded in the North East during the first six months in terms of deal values with the second quarter down almost 70% on the first three months although in reality this was accounted for by the £1.5bn sale of the Priory Group in February. \nUnderlying disclosed deal values held up well with a total of £507m for the period April to June and interestingly deal volumes were up on the first quarter by more than 30% to 44. Compared to the first six months of 2015 overall deal activity in the region has increased. \nThere was a significant amount of private equity activity in the North East during the second quarter with technology being a particularly active sector mirroring the global M&A picture. \nIn June Middlesbrough based Onyx was acquired by Pulsant which provided an exit for Livingbridge who initially invested £16m in the IT infrastructure business in 2011. The private equity firm also exited Frank Recruitment Group during the quarter in a secondary buy-out to TPG. The majority stake valued Newcastle based Frank Recruitment at close to £200m. \nPerformance Horizon Group completed a second round funding of over £10m in June which included new investment from the Greycroft Growth fund. The company, based at Boldon Business Park is a global leader in digital partner marketing. \nPrivate equity also invested in other sectors during the period. \nSynova Capital invested £25m in financial planning business Fairstone Group in April in order to grow the business through acquisitions. \nAlso growing was Verdant Leisure who acquired two holiday parks in County Durham following a secondary buy-out by Palatine Private Equity. The £40m deal was an exit for RJD Partners who first invested in Verdant in September 2010 when it backed a management team in the buy-in of Dunham Leisure Limited. Cycling accessory distributor Zyro \nLDC backed the management buy-out of cycling accessories business Zyro who then combined with Fisher Outdoor Leisure Holdings to create a £70m turnover group. \nThis increase in mid-market private equity activity was not only recorded in the North East. \nNationally the Centre for Management Buyout Research (CMBOR) reported an increase in activity from 22 deals in the second half of 2015 to 25 for the first six months of this year. Total deal values were down but once again this represents a slowdown in the number of mega deals. Secondary buy-outs were also credited as a major source of deal flow. \nOf course most of the deals activity took place prior to the Brexit vote and we have yet to see the full impact on activity and values. \nWhat we do know is that we have been operating in a climate of uncertainty for some time and this looks set to continue. There is, however, potential for the short term impact to be somewhat offset by the significant weakening of the GBP versus the USD (at 10 year average lows), perhaps encouraging inbound activity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-08-15T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-08-14T20:44:06.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
