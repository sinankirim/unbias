Last year, it racked up a £3.4 million loss on sales of £19.3 million.The deal to sell the business was struck under former Asda boss Andy Clarke, who has since been replaced by Sean Clarke.Photo-Me chief executive Serge Crasnianski said: “This is an interesting opportunity to significantly expand our UK business in a strong set of locations and increase our market share in the digital photo printing market, which we believe has growth potential in the digital age.”Mr Crasnianski added that he aims to “improve the level of trading and overall performance over the next two years and beyond”.Last week, Asda laid bare the challenge awaiting Mr Clarke after reporting its worst quarterly performance on record. The chain - owned by US giant Walmart - posted a 7.5% fall in like-for-like sales in the second quarter.In June, Photo-Me International said it captured a rise in full-year profits, helped by the introduction of a new Japanese identity card.Pre-tax profits rose 4.1% to £40.1 million while revenues were boosted 3.8% to £184 million as the firm also hailed the perforrmance of its Revolution self-service laundry machines. Asda has sold its photo business to Photo-Me International in £5.35m deal.
