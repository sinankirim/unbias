No longer was there a need to offer choice to the public: all we get is slightly different iterations of the same Agatha Christie crimesolving geriatric. \nFor a moment we wondered what we could do to stop the Marplisation of popular culture. But there is little point in trying to halt progress. \nIt seems likely that, before long, all that terrestrial TV will offer us is a choice between differently aged actresses solving gruesome murders simply by being a sly old fox. TV and film companies will base their entire new output on 12 novels written in the 1930s and ‘40s, while young and male actors will have to make do with bit parts as vicars and gamekeepers. \nSome may bemoan this narrowing of our shared culture, but there is something reassuring about a Marpled future. Instead of the horrors of the daily news, reality TV and England football performances, each night in front of gogglebox will see a murder in the Cotswolds revealed, investigated by an antidilvian amateur slueth and solved within the space of two hours. \nNo longer will we worry about Brexit, terrorism or Corbynistas. The only choice we will have to make is between Geraldine McEwan, Margaret Rutherford or Angela Lansbury as our ubiquitous crime-solving old fogy. \nI know some of you will say we should resist and fight until the powers-that-be give us Poirot on every channel. But that way madness lies.
