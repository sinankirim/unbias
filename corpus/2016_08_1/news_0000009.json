Until then, stay tuned to http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/business/ 09:27 Robert Gibson-NEC Board formed to examine impact of second runway at Gatwick \nGatwick Airport has formed a board to study the impact of a second runway. \nThe airport said the Gatwick Growth Board (GGB) will examine the economic and social impacts of the airport’s future growth and expansion plans on the local area, the South East, and on the economy of the UK.The GGB will look at the implications of Gatwick’s national status in the context of both one runway and two.Gatwick said a “natural focus” of the board’s work will be the impacts associated with a second runway.But it will also examine the impacts of Gatwick’s place in the economy and its expansion in the context of a single runway, recognising that a new runway will not be open until 2025. 09:22 Robert Gibson-NEC BA to cut food service \nBritish Airways has cut its food service and will no longer provide two meals to economy travellers on flights under eight and a half hours.The apparent cost-cutting measures also apply to journeys of less than seven hours for premium economy passengers.The reduced menu was introduced last month and came after reports the airline was going to charge for its meals. Instead of two full meals passengers will get only one and might have to make do with snacks if they get hungrier later in the flight. The choices of alcohol and complimentary snacks will not be affected, a BA spokesman said.Many flights from the UK to the east coast of America, including New York, take between seven and eight hours while the journey to Toronto and Montreal in Canada is around seven hours.Spaniard Alex Cruz, 50, took over as CEO and chairman of BA in April this year, having started his career with American Airlines 1995.Parent company International Airlines Group reported total profits after tax of £2.5 billion for the year ending December 2015, and the group saw a 65% rise in annual profits this year.A BA spokesman said: “We offer customers on all of our transatlantic flights a three course meal, bar service and snacks and on our longer transatlantic flights, including to the west coast, customers are offered an extra meal during the flight.“We regularly review our catering to ensure we are investing where it matters most to our customers.” British Airways has cut its food service and will no longer provide two meals to economy travellers on flights under eight and a half hours 09:19 Robert Gibson-NEC Up to 300 businesses affected by data breach at Newcastle technology firm Sage \nA data breach at software giant Sage may have compromised personal information for employees at 300 businesses, it has been reported. \nThe Newcastle firm notified its UK business customers that their information — including employee bank account details and salary information — may have been affected by a data breach. \nPolice are now investigating the breach and Sage is probing the “unauthorised access” of data by someone using an “internal” company computer login. \nThe Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), responsible for the enforcement of the Data Protection Act 1998, has also been informed. \nIt has been reported that a “maximum of between 200 and 300 companies” may have been affected by the breach. \nA Sage spokesman said: “We are investigating unauthorised access to customer information using an internal login. \n“We cannot comment further whilst we work with the authorities to investigate - but our customers remain our first priority and we are speaking directly with those affected.” \nFull story here: http://bit.ly/2aXfnoe The Sage Group HQ at Great Park, Newcastle 09:08 Robert Gibson-NEC 'Brexit uncertainty' hits house prices \nThe average price tag on a home fell by£3,600 in August as “Brexit uncertainty” combined with the summer holiday slowdown.The £3,602 month-on-month fall in the price of property coming to market took the average asking price across England and Wales to £304,222 in August, property website Rightmove said.Despite the decrease, the average asking price is still 4.1% higher than it was a year ago.Rightmove said the 1.2% month-on-month fall in asking prices is in line with average decreases usually seen during the summer holidays.But it predicted 2016 will be a “year of two halves” for the housing market, with a surge in buyers already having been seen in the first half of the year as buy-to-let investors rushed to beat a stamp duty hike which was imposed for this sector on April 1. Many purchases were brought forward which might otherwise have taken place later in the year.Miles Shipside, director at Rightmove, said: “Many prospective buyers take a summer break from home-hunting, and those who come to market at this quieter time of year tend to price more aggressively.“This summer is also affected by both Brexit uncertainty and the aftermath of the buy-to-let rush in March to beat the stamp duty deadline.” 09:06 Robert Gibson-NEC Insurers warn on early pension withdrawl \nSome people using the new pension freedoms may be plundering too much from their retirement pots too soon, insurers have warned.The Association of British Insurers (ABI) said that while the vast majority of savers appear to be taking a “sensible approach”, a small minority may be withdrawing cash at a rate that sees their money run out in a decade or less.Launched in April 2015, the pension freedoms give the over-55s a much wider choice over how they use their retirement money.Previously, they may have been required to use their pot to buy a fixed income called an annuity. 08:57 Robert Gibson-NEC Newcastle film company announces first feature film \nA Newcastle-based film production company has announced it has begun work on its first feature film. \nSTINE, which is being produced by Candle & Bell, is a sci-fi movie set in Newcastle in the near future. \nIt is being written and directed by Kat Wood, who is originally from Yarm, and is being developed with the support of Creative England’s Emerging Talent Fund via the BFI NET.WORK. \nProducer Maria Caruana Galizia of Candle & Bell said: “When Kat first sent me her ideas for STINE I knew it was a film I had to produce. Business, Maria Caruana Galizia of Candle and Bell 08:52 Robert Gibson-NEC Study shows business leaders looking for 'soft' skills \nBusiness leaders are increasingly looking for ‘soft’ skills and personality as well as academic achievements when hiring workers, a new study shows. \nResearch among 1,750 businessmen and women found that more than half were interested in whether a candidate had done any volunteering work.British Gas said its survey revealed that a third of employers look at someone’s social media profile to gauge their personality before meeting them in person.Most believed jobseekers should focus on soft skills such as communication, as much as academic grades.Claire Miles, managing director for customer operations at British Gas, said: “Whilst good exam results can boost opportunities for young people, our survey highlights that employers are also looking for evidence of soft skills and personality before making a final decision on whom to hire.“Most young people think that employers only care about their academic achievements, but that’s not the case. There’s a real opportunity for young people to boost their chances of employment through volunteering, which is a great indicator of soft skills.” A British Gas survey has revealed that business leaders are increasingly looking for 'soft' skills and personality as well as academic achievements 08:48 Robert Gibson-NEC Supermarket sales drop \nSupermarket sales have sunk below the £100bn mark for the first time in six years amid fierce competition in the UK grocery sector, a report has found.Food retail revenues dropped by 3% to £99bn in the second quarter, according to The Share Centre’s Profit Watch UK study, with overall revenues of UK plc slipping 2% to £341.7 billion over the period.The big four grocers have been struggling to protect their market share from the rise of German discounters Aldi and Lidl.Meanwhile, the UK launch of online grocery service AmazonFresh in June looks set to make the grocery sector even tougher.Helal Miah, investment research analyst at The Share Centre, said intense price pressure led to a tough year for UK supermarkets, while companies exposed to UK consumer spending enjoyed a fillip from a “burgeoning” UK economy.But he said the lift will be short lived as uncertainty triggered by the EU referendum result takes its toll on economic growth. 08:41 Robert Gibson-NEC 'We cannot afford to waste a minute' - think tank \nThink-tank Policy North has also welcomed the Chancellor’s announcement, but warned that there must be no delay on devolution. \nChairman Stephen Purvis said: “This is really welcome news for our region. The Government has now delivered on the reassurances that council leaders have been asking for. \n“We now need the region’s council leaders to deliver on their promise of devolution to bring more jobs and investment to our region. Manchester and Liverpool are already racing ahead and the North East really is being left behind. \n“With these assurances from the Chancellor now in place, we cannot afford to waste a minute in delivering on devolution. The longer things drag out, we risk losing not just the £3bn in new spending power that devolution brings, but missing out on new jobs and investment.” \nFull story here: http://bit.ly/2aNdbCE 08:34 Robert Gibson-NEC North East LEP welcomes Government EU structural funds announcement \nThe North East Local Enterprise Partnership has welcomed the announcement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer detailing the future of EU Structural Funding. \nPhilip Hammond has confirmed that all structural and investment fund projects signed before the Autumn Statement will be fully funded, even when these projects continue beyond the UK’s departure from the EU. \nHelen Golightly, North East LEP Chief Operating Officer, said: “We are delighted that the Government has provided clarity and reassurance about EU funded projects with the Autumn Statement deadline. This is good news for North East business and jobs. \n“We will work hard with our private and public sector partners to ensure that our region seizes maximum value from the EU Structural Funds programme. \n“We will also continue to seek clarity from Government about funding for projects beyond the Autumn Statement deadline, which is very important for the future economic growth of our region.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-08-15T15:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-08-15T11:41:51.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
