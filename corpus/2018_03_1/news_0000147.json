Standing up against the Remain Rally in Exeter. \n“ @BenPBradshaw clearly struggles with the concept of democracy. Is that the cash of #Soros in your pocket Benjamin? Or are you really pleased to see my friends?” \nBradshaw replied: “.V pleased to have seen your small UKIP group as a reminder of all the broken promises made in the campaign & that Nigel himself called for a vote on the deal #FBPE #brexitshambles.” Brexit protest march at Bedford Square, Exeter Bridget Batchelor Photography (Image: Bridget Batchelor Photography) \nIt isn’t the first time the two have shared disagreements with each other. In 2016, Bradshaw claimed he was heckled by the TV personality as he spoke to striking junior doctors. \nHe tweeted at the time: “Proud to have been shouted at by my well-known Conservative constituent @ kthopkins while talking to #juniordoctors outside @ rdehospital .” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-25T11:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T12:13:07.100+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
