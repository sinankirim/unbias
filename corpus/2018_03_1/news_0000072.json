Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA Labour MP says she has been victimised because of action her local council has taken against her husband. \nEmma Lewell-Buck , Labour MP for South Shields, said: “It’s not pleasant but I’m not going to just sit here and neither is my husband.” \nSouth Tyneside Council is to debate findings published by the Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman, which criticise the way the authority conducted an investigation into Mrs Lewell-Buck’s husband, Simon Buck, a care worker. \nThe Ombudsman report calls on the council to apologise, and to pay Mr Buck £400 “to recognise the impact of avoidable delay, distress, uncertainty and time and trouble caused by the faults identified in this report”. \nIt follows claims, denied by Mr Buck, that he was abusive towards two vulnerable adults receiving care. In one case, he was said to have sworn at an a vulnerable adult and his wife. \nIn the second, he was said to have sworn at a vulnerable adult and wrongly said the man’s incontinence pad was clean. \nInvestigations by the council concluded these accusations were true. However, the Ombudsman has criticised the council for failing to follow its procedures properly.

South Shields Town Hall (Image: Newcastle Chronicle) \nMrs Lewell-Buck said: “I find it very bizarre. I was a local councillor myself for 20 years and not once did we debate an Ombudsman’s report.” \nShe pointed out the report simply referred to her husband as “Mr Y”, but his full identity had become known to the local media. \n“Simon’s name and the name of the other parties were not published, but his name had clearly been leaked to a newspaper.” \nShe claims her husband had been unfairly targeted. \n“What better way to get at the MP than to destroy her husband,” she said. \nMr Buck said: “I cannot begin to describe the stress of the past couple of years since these allegations appeared out of the blue, aimed at discrediting me. \n“I flatly deny all of them and note that not a shred of evidence has been produced beyond hearsay to stand any of them up.” \nHe added: “I have had to watch as my wife, who is a really hardworking and dedicated local MP, has struggled to deal with the torrent of attacks and attempts to undermine her which come from this council.” Read More Fury over decision to manufacture post-Brexit blue passports in France - what our MPs are saying Here is the full statement from South Tyneside Council: \nA spokesperson for South Tyneside Council said: “South Tyneside Council accepts the Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman findings of minor administrative failing in this case where the council was acting as the administering body for investigations into the abuse of vulnerable people. \n“The Ombudsman has not however challenged the decision made by a panel of multi-agency professionals to uphold a finding of abuse by Mr Y and there is no further challenge to this decision. \n“We are therefore concerned that the council has been asked to make a payment of compensation to a perpetrator of elder abuse. \n“In this case, the Council was unable to demonstrate from the historical electronic care records, that it had shared a report in a specific timeframe, even though it could demonstrate that the complainant was given an opportunity to present his views and challenge the facts in person. \n“We will remind staff of the importance of documenting actions taken and making clear records of the reasons for decisions made by professionals and communicating those in a timely manner. \n“As required by the Ombudsman, the recommendations in his report will be considered at a meeting of Borough Council on Monday 26th March 2018. \n“The Ombudsman’s report on this case is available online and copies are available from South Shields Town Hall, Hebburn Central and Jarrow Town Hall.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-24T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-24T15:24:58.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
