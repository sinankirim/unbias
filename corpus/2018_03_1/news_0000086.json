Data suggests that if the culprits are found, they are moved along. \nNorthumbria Police say while intimidating people is illegal, ticket begging isn’t. \nThe force add while one persistent offender has been removed from the area, criminal action is “not necessarily” the way it wants to tackle the ticket beggars. \nNexus, the Metro’s operator, say customers should refuse to hand over their ticket. \nBut Ashleigh Harle said it isn’t always that simple. \n“When they hover over you when you have your card, it is intimidating,” said the 27-year-old, who lives near the station. \n“When I was working, I would be asked every week for my ticket, and when they are drunk you can feel quite vulnerable. \n“I feel more could definitely be done to stop it.” A metro ticket (Image: Newcastle Chronicle) \nNexus spends £1m a year on a dedicated Northumbria Police Metro Unit and has revenue protection officers - backed up by 600 CCTV cameras - operating across all 60 stations. \nBut it makes no profit from the line, meaning fares would have to go up to offer extra security staff. \nThere’s another option - the Withdrawal of Implied Permission (WIP) scheme - which they can use to ban beggars from the line. \n“One individual has also been removed from the area completely thanks to the proactive work of neighbourhood officers in the area and this has had an impact,” said a Northumbria Police spokesperson. \n“Nexus can issue a WIP to individuals who cause a nuisance on the Metro line and this bans them from the entire network. \n“This is just one option that can be used in the first instance and gives police the power to take action if individuals breach that order.” \nNexus add that, with evidence, it is a tactic it would use again. \nA Nexus spokesman said: “We work closely with Northumbria Police to deal with anti-social behaviour and crime when it occurs on Metro, including aggressive begging. This is something we are targeting through joint actions including high visibility patrols.” \nAnd, despite locals claims, police claim ticket begging “is not something that is being reported regularly” by the public.

If any customer is approached for their used Metro ticket at any Metro station we advise them to refuse, and if they feel threatened they should report that to the police.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-25T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T21:55:41.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
