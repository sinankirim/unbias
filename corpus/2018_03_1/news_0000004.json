Unless an agreement is reached with our trading partners in the coming months, a significant economic price will have to be paid.” \nHere are the countries and groups of countries the UK already has deals with as part of EU membership: Albania ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-11T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-11T11:31:32.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
