In a year’s time we’ll be leaving the EU and it’s important we lay the ground over the coming months for a future where these children, and children across the UK, can flourish and reach their full potential. \n“The North East is already home to great schools, renowned universities, and thriving research, manufacturing and cultural sectors. It’s my mission to make sure that this continues and develops, and that no community is left behind as we plan both our domestic agenda and our Brexit strategy. \n“That’s why my government has been working closely with Northern businesses and stakeholders to boost growth and ensure their interests are truly represented in the Brexit negotiations.” \nIn an apparent bid to illustrate the Government’s commitment to the region, Ministers announced funding of almost £15 million to help North East businesses and universities work together.

He told the Independent that Mrs May should offer a free vote in the Commons on the final Brexit deal, telling the Independent that if she did not, Labour and Tory MPs should be ready to vote with their conscience and rebel. Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair (Image: 2018 Getty Images) \nThe Labour Police and Crime Commissioner for Northumbria criticised the Prime Minister for failing to speak to police officers during her visit to the region. \nDame Vera Baird said: “My long standing invitation to Theresa May to see the excellent initiatives police officers and staff are working on still stands - let’s hope one day she’ll show her appreciation for the great work happening at Northumbria Police.” \nAnd Labour North East MEP Jude Kirton-Darling branded the tour a “desperate cry to unite the country”.

We know that our region’s economy will be hit the hardest in the country due to Brexit, and the damage forecast of a 16% drop in GDP in case of a hard Brexit simply shoul dn’t be a possible scenario. “Ruling out participating in the EU’s customs union and single market is effectively choosing to put up barriers to UK trade with Europe after Brexit which risks the future of our economy and business.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T18:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T19:55:47.108+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
