Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nWe are set to leave the EU on March 29, 2019 and the 12-month countdown has begun. \nIt’s a thought that scares and excites people in equal measure but even now not everyone is clear as to what is happening and why and what has been agreed so far. \nSo let us help you get clued up on the Brexit story so far. \nOK, just remind us how we got here An EU flag flying in front of the Houses of Parliament (Image: PA) \nOn June 23, 2016, the UK voted by 17.4 million to 16.1 million to leave the European Union. It was a huge surprise for which Sunderland took a disproportionate amount of blame from those who wanted to remain in Europe. Even the New York Times turned up there to ask the people of Wearside why they voted to leave the EU. \nAnd what’s happened in the intervening couple of years? \nWe’ve had a change in Prime Minister , a general election which both main parties seemed to argue they’d won not lost, and the Government was taken to court to ensure that Parliament should vote on triggering Article 50. \nArticle 50 - it’s been a while since I’ve heard the term so, enlighten us as to what it is again \nIt’s a section contained within the Lisbon Treaty. This Treaty was signed in 2007 by the leaders of all countries which are EU members and its idea was to make the EU more democratic, transparent and efficient. It came into force in 2009.

Before that, they had no legal way to leave once they’d signed up. “Triggering” it means formally telling the other EU members of our intention to pull out. \nAnd we of course did this ... when? Prime Minister Theresa May (Image: PA) \nIn March 2017, nine months after the UK voted for Brexit. Prime Minister Theresa May signed a letter triggering the process, which was handed over to the European Council’s president Donald Tusk who didn’t look very happy about it. \nThis was followed by a statement from Mrs May to the House of Commons, where she said now was “the moment for the country to come together”, words that proved wildly optimistic. Read More Brexit will mean less money and more work for North East charities as they fight against hatred \nWhat happened next? \nLots of talking until on March 19 a transition agreement, which is conditional on both sides agreeing a final withdrawal treaty, was signed. \nThe transitional period will last from Brexit day on March 29, 2019 to December 31, 2020. \nWhat does this mean? \nIt mean EU citizens arriving in the UK between these two dates will enjoy the same rights and guarantees as those who arrive before Brexit. The same will apply to UK expats on the continent. \nThe UK’s share of fishing catch will be guaranteed during transition but UK will effectively remain part of the Common Fisheries Policy, yet without a direct say in its rules, until the end of 2020. Northern Ireland will effectively stay in parts of the single market and the customs union in the absence of other solutions to avoid a hard border with the Republic of Ireland.
