EU and Union flags (Image: PA) \nThe North East breakdown of figures differed from the national result. While 41% thought spending on transport and infrastructure was the best way to narrow the gap and was consistent with the national figure, the Northern Powerhouse project (12%) came next followed by Brexit at 11%. \nIn the North East, 49% of those asked thought the divide had widened since 2013, 30% thought it had stayed the same and 5% believed it had narrowed. \nA lack of opportunities to progress careers and earn more in the North emerged from the study as a key marker of the divide.

Stephen Purvis, founder and Group CEO of SGP Technology \nPolicy North chairman, Stephen Purvis, said: “The North-South divide is very real and remains a big challenge to crack. Businesses we talk to are clear that they don’t want a bigger begging bowl and exporting jobs from the south is not a sustainable solution. \n“Manchester has shown that with devolved powers comes real cash and the ability for local leaders to set their own priorities, but there is also an east-west divide. We need an equally strong, outward looking, global vision for the North East and Yorkshire, that is not simply built around slightly quicker journey times between regions.

If the major ports in the north were given free port status, they could generate hundreds of thousands of jobs and inject billions of pounds into local economies. It would be the most effective northern economic development programme by any government. \n“Ownership of our own state support rules would, for example, allow the soft-launch of a direct Newcastle to London City flight route; much needed by the growing financial and digital sectors. A dedicated report on this is already underway within Policy North.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-08T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T08:00:38.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
