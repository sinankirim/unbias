Also involved are Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, and Steve Rotherham, the mayor of the Liverpool City Region. \nThe Convention is set to take place in June alongside the start of the three-month Great Exhibition, which will see thousands of visitors come to Newcastle and Gateshead to discover the story of the north of England through its innovators, artists, designers and businesses. Newcastle City Council leader Nick Forbes (left) Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham \nCoun Forbes said: “For too long successive governments have been able to ignore calls for greater investment across the north, by forcing major cities to compete against each other. \n“By coming together and having one strong voice we can present an united front to Government as well as ensure stronger collaboration on major transport schemes.” \nOne of the key issues to be discussed is the Northern Powerhouse Rail project, an ambitious plan to turn the HS2 high speed rail scheme - which links the North West, Yorkshire and the West Midlands with London - into a truly national rail network connect cities such as Newcastle, Hull, Manchester and Liverpool. \nProposals include improving the East Coast Main Line and building a new stretch of line across the Pennines. \nBut local political leaders say they fear the Government will fail to fund the scheme as it comes under pressure to keep the cost of HS2 down. \nThe Convention will also provide an opportunity for northern leaders to repeat their call for a seat at the Brexit discussions. Currently, the Mayor of London and devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland can have their say, but there is no permanent seat at the table for the English regions. \nAnd the Convention will allow political, civic and business leaders to set out plans for further and faster devolution, giving the North the chance to shape its own future.

Mr Burnham said: “If we sit back and leave it to old Westminster way of doing things, there is a real risk that North will end up with second-class transport plans and a London-centric Brexit. \n“Through devolution, we have a real chance of rebalancing this country from South to North. The Convention of the North could give the North a louder voice than it has ever had before and help to get us the right decisions on rail investment, Brexit and further devolution.” \nHe added: “People in the North have been promised a Northern Powerhouse and this Convention will be the way of making sure they get it.” \nMr Rotheram said: “When civic leaders in the North built the world’s first ever passenger railway they were forging an industrial revolution that changed the world. It is absolutely vital that we regain that level of autonomy and ambition if we are to unleash the potential of a new Northern Powerhouse.” Read More More of us are set to use the train - but North East services are already full \nThe Northern Powerhouse Rail Campaign is set to be launched in London on Tuesday by the Northern Powerhouse Partnership. \nThe Great Exhibition of the North will officially open on the evening of Friday, June 22 when a giant fountain, paying homage to The Angel of the North, will rise over the River Tyne. \nA new film telling the inspiring story of the North will be projected on a big screen and an anthem for the North, by poet and playwright Lemn Sissay, will get a first airing. \nA Great Contemporary Craft Fair will open at The Biscuit Factory, Newcastle, and there will be the first performance of MESH, with people dancing through the streets, by Vanessa Grasse.
