It provides a hall free of charge for Beaumont Leys residents as well as breakfast clubs and a cafe.

They have grants of £69,400 and £8,800 respectively. Read More ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T11:07:11.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
