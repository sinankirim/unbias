It is completely unnecessary and it is symbolically completely wrong. \n“Whatever the conditions which led to the decision in terms of pricing, the fact is that this is a symbolic event.” \nFormer cabinet minister Priti Patel told The Sun: “This should be a moment that we should be celebrating. The return of our iconic blue passport will re-establish the British identity. \n“But to be putting the job in the hands of the French is simply astonishing. It is a national humiliation.

The irony is unreal. \n“I guess the Brexit Blue is now classed as French Navy.” Read More Mothercare, Moss Bros and CarpetRight: More big high street names struggling \nA Home Office spokeswoman said: “We are running a fair and open competition to ensure that the new contract delivers a high quality and secure product and offers the best value for money for customers. \n“All passports will continue to be personalised with the holder’s details in the United Kingdom, meaning that no personal data will leave the UK. \n“We do not require passports to be manufactured in the UK. A proportion of blank passport books are currently manufactured overseas, and there are no security or operational reasons why this would not continue.” Like us on Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-22T09:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-22T11:45:45.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
