He is in the same category as Bob Geldof.\" \nRefusing to let the argument end, adding the hashtag #hakenews, Lineker said: \"No, I think you're funny. Funny how you pretend to care about the industry yet during the three years that you were a member of the European Parliament Fisheries Committee, you attended one out of 42 meetings.\" poll loading How would you vote if a Brexit referendum was held now? 1000+ VOTES SO FAR ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-22T10:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-22T11:45:42.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
