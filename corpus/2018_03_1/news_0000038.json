Read More \nThree of the company's Devon shops - in Exeter (New Look Men's), Torquay and Sidmouth - have been identified for closure under the CVA proposal. \nNew Look is seeking creditor approval on the proposal, which is due on March 21 2018. \nAll UK stores will remain open as normal during the period of the proposal and the Company’s online sales channel will be completely unaffected by the proposed changes. The new Look in Torquay is one of the town's biggest shops (Image: Geograph) \nDaniel Butters and Neville Kahn of Deloitte LLP, the business advisory firm, have been appointed as Nominees to the CVA. Read More This is exactly when Exeter's Toys 'R' Us will close \nNew Look, which announced the closure of its Plymstock Broadway store in 2017, saw like-for-like sales in the UK slide 10.7 per cent, while online sales through New Look’s website fell 15 per cent. \nAlistair McGeorge, Executive Chairman of New Look, said: “Given our challenged trading performance and over-rented UK store estate, we are having to take tough but necessary actions to reduce our fixed cost base and restore long-term profitability. \n“We have held constructive discussions with our key landlords and strategic partners and will now seek creditor approval on our CVA proposal. \n\"A priority for us is to keep all potentially affected colleagues informed during this difficult time.” It's branches in Exeter and Sidmouth are also at risk \nDaniel Butters, Partner at Deloitte, said: “The retail trading environment in the UK remains extremely challenging, driven by weaker consumer confidence, the implications of Brexit and competition from online channels. \n“New Look is an iconic brand on the high street and the CVA will provide a stable platform upon which Management’s turnaround plan can be delivered. We have fully engaged with the British Property Federation and its members and their views are reflected in what we believe is a fair proposal to restructure the property obligations of the Company. \n“It is important to stress that no stores will close on day one, and employees, suppliers and business rates will continue to be paid on time and in full.” Read More Frankie & Benny’s and Chiquito are the latest restaurant chains under threat of closure \nCommenting on the news, Editor in Chief of money.co.uk Hannah Maundrell, said: “It’s sad but not surprising New Look are closing stores - it will be yet another sad loss to many high streets. \n\"It’s no secret New Look have been struggling for a while and all eyes have been on the clothes retailer in the current economic climate. \n\"With so much shop floor rent eating through profits, they simply can't justify having physical shops anymore. \n“The pattern of well loved stores filing for administration or cutting jobs over the last few weeks is terrible news for the UK's high streets. \n\"Inflation, lack of rises in wages and shoppers demanding bargains has resulted in the perfect storm and high streets up and down the country are turning in to ghost towns. \n\"Retailers who are only trading online are always going to win without the extra staffing costs of expensive stores to upkeep. \n“It’s undoubtedly distressing news for employees of New Look and their families especially because their fates with the business are currently uncertain. \n\"Now is the time to check what redundancy rights you have and dig out any income or mortgage protection policies you hold just in case.” Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T17:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T17:33:47.065+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
