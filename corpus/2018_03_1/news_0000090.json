Of those, 73% were classed as “better jobs”, meaning they were either at managerial level or above or in professional occupations. \nThe report also highlights the region’s exporting record, which saw £12.7bn of goods exported in 2016/17, with the EU accounting for 59% of all exports - a higher rate than the rest of England. \nDiscussing plans to maintain and strengthen the region’s international trade ties, the report says: “The North East LEP will work with its partners to deliver these objectives. \n“However, the success of these measures will also rely on the UK having strong relationships and appropriate treaties in place with other nations. \n“As the UK Government goes through the process of leaving the EU, it is critically important for the North East’s businesses and residents that they negotiate the best possible terms of access to other markets for the UK.” Read More Durham's Crafter's Companion forges partnership with UK art company \nThe LEP report comes less than a month after a leaked Government impact report on Brexit revealed that the North East would be worst affected by leaving the EU, regardless of whatever deal was negotiated by the Government. \nLast week it was also warned that the UK automotive industry could be devastated by a no-deal Brexit, with the North East again likely to be among the hardest hit.

Between them, the three categories accounted for 90% of all exported goods from the region, with the LEP saying that “the region is heavily dependent on a small number of commodities for its exports”. \nThe report outlines how the employment between the North East and the rest of England has narrowed by 28% since 2014, but the region had the lowest spending on R&D in England, and below average skill levels.
