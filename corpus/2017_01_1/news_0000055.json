Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nBritain is facing three years of slow growth and rising unemployment , but North East businesses could continue to grow, according to a major think tank. \nA report by EY Item Club has claimed that the Brexit-induced collapse in the pound is set to cause a radical rebalancing of the economy. \nThe report, which uses the Treasury’s own models to make its forecasts, is estimating GDP growth in 2017 at 1.3% and a lower rate of 1% in 2018. \nHowever, North East businesses could still benefit from the rebalnce as UK exports are expected to increase by 3.3% and 5.2% over the same period. \nSandra Thompson, incoming North East senior partner at EY adds: “Whatever the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, there are clear indications that the fall in the pound and the UK’s exit from the EU will entail a change in the structure of the UK economy. \n“The North East is the only English region that exported more than it imported in 2014, according to Government statistics. The onus therefore will be on businesses to continue seeking opportunities overseas in response to the slowing domestic economy.” Read More Newcastle's Cundall Johnston adds £9.8m to turnover after year of investment \nThe forecasts mirror comments made last week by experts at UBS Wealth Management, who claimed that rising inflation and low wage growth will cause households to be worse off in 2017. \nMark Gregory, EY’s chief economist, said: “Whatever the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, there are clear indications that the fall in the pound and the UK’s exit from the EU will entail a change in the structure of the UK economy.” \nThe pound has fallen more than 18% against the US dollar since the June 23 referendum and £1 now buys around 1.23 US dollars, down from 1.50 prior to the vote. \nWhile a weak pound will boost hopes for exporters, domestic inflation is forecast to soar to 3.1% by the final quarter of 2017, eroding disposable income and hitting consumer spending.
