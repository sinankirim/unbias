Could   \nNewcastle law firm Muckle added £1m to its bottom line but has warned that Brexit is already having a negative impact on its business. \nThe 28-partner firm saw profits soar by 65% from £1.6m to £2.6m for the year ending April 2016. Over the same period Muckle added £600,000 to its turnover, which grew to £12.1m. \nDespite the strong results over the last financial year, managing partner Jason Wainwright said that the firm’s 2017 performance may suffer due to Brexit. \nMr Wainwright said: “Whilst naturally delighted with our latest results, we remain vigilant of the local and national economic uncertainty. \n\"We saw a reduction in work levels as a result of a slow-down in the economic climate after the Brexit vote in Q1 and Q2 of the current financial year, which we expect to influence our 2017 year-end performance and results. \n“However, despite the on-going uncertainty in the market place, we have seen a sharp increase in work levels since September and are experiencing some good successes and key client and work wins.” \nMuckle is based in Time Central in Newcastle city centre and employs 146 people.

It also saw a strong performance from its dispute resolution and social housing teams. \nMr Wainwright added: “We have also been buoyed by the first in a series of our ‘State of the Region’ business forums we hosted with the North East LEP, which was attended by over 100 businesses and was an invaluable opportunity for us to listen to the collective issues and concerns regarding the present economic and political climate from the North East business fraternity.” \nThe State of the Region seminars are designed to address key issues faced by businesses in the North East. The discussions cover areas such as how Brexit and devolution affect the local economy. \nMuckle is currently advising the Football Association on its Parklife scheme to build over 100 new pitches across the country. The new facilities will cost £200m and will be developed over 30 towns and cities.
