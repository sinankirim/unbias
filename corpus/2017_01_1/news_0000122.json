Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nLegislation allowing the UK to leave the European Union could be debated by MPs for just five days. \nThe European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill 2016-17, which allows the Prime Minister to begin the Brexit process, was formally presented to the House of Commons by David Davis, the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union. \nDiscussion begins on Tuesday January 31 and continues on Wednesday, when the Bill will receive its “second reading”. This could involve a formal vote of MPs. \nThe following week, MPs will have three days to consider amendments to the Bill, when it enters what is known as “committee stage”. \nCritics claimed the Government was failing to give Parliament enough time to consider the legislation. \nThe Bill simply states that the Prime Minister “may notify, under Article 50(2) of the Treaty on European Union, the United Kingdom’s intention to withdraw from the EU”. It says nothing about what sort of arrangements should be put in place instead. \nPrime Minister Theresa May has promised to produce a White Paper setting out the Government’s plan for Brexit, but the Government says this will be debated separately. Prime Minister Theresa May \nMr Davis said: “The British people have made the decision to leave the EU and this government is determined to get on with the job of delivering it. \n“So today we have introduced a Bill in Parliament which will allow us to formally trigger Article 50 by the end of March. \n“I trust that Parliament, which backed the referendum by six to one, will respect the decision taken by the British people and pass the legislation quickly.” \nFurther Commons debate is possible, because the legislation will then go to the House of Lords - which could attempt to amend it. \nIf the Lords does amend the legislation, then MPs will discuss whether to accept the proposed changes. \nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn confirmed that he would impose a three-line whip on his MPs to vote in favour of the legislation. This traditionally means that any members of his senior team, such as a Shadow Minister, must vote in the way instructed by the leadership or resign from their role. \nIt prompted speculation that some Labour front-benchers could walk out of their posts, because they have indicated they are not prepared to vote for Brexit.

It is a vote on the article 50...we will put out a statement today to our members that we want them to vote for article 50.” \nBut Mr Corbyn also acknowledged that this would be difficult for some MPs, saying: “I fully understand the pressures and issues that members are under, those who represent leave constituencies and those who represent remain constituencies. Labour is in the almost unique position of having MPs representing constituencies in both directions and very strongly in both directions.” Brexit Secretary David Davis speaks in the House of Commons, London, after the Government's defeat in a historic court battle over Brexit. \nLiberal Democrat leader Tim Farron says his party will vote against Brexit unless the Government allows a second referendum on the question of what the UK’s future relationship with the EU should be. He insists this is not an attempt to overturn the decision to leave the EU. \nMr Farron said: “With Labour totally confused over Brexit and the Conservatives determined to take us out of Europe and the Single Market at any cost, only the Liberal Democrats are fighting for full membership of the Single Market and a public vote on the final deal.” \nChris Leslie, a backbench Labour MP and supporter of the Open Britain campaign, accused the Government of trying to “railroad” the Bill through Parliament. \nHe said: “The Government had to be dragged kicking and screaming by the courts to bring this bill before Parliament and yet they still seem determined to gag parliamentarians as much as possible. \n“It is simply unacceptable for Ministers to try and railroad this incredibly important law through Parliament without sufficient time for proper debate.

Your questions answered \n“It beggars belief that we will have far less time to debate the legislation that takes us out of the EU than we did previous European treaties.” \nMeanwhile, Ms Onwurah has called on the Government to confirm that EU nationals currently in the UK legally will be allowed to stay. \nThe Government has said it is only willing to guarantee their status if other EU nations confirm that British nationals will also be allowed to stay in their countries. \nMs Onwurah said many residents in her Newcastle Central constituency have contacted her to raise their deep concerns. \nSpeaking in the House of Commons, she urged Brexit Secretary David Davis: “Would the Secretary of State agree with me it is even more important that the UK Government sends a strong moral message that goods and chattels are bargaining chips but human beings are not.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T01:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T21:00:27.683+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
