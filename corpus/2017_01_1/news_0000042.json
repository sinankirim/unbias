X \nCopy link to paste in your message / \nThe Liberal Democrats have chosen a Brexiteer to try to unseat Tory North West Leicestershire MP Andrew Bridgen at the next General election. \nCouncillor Michael Wyatt has been selected to fight the election scheduled for 2020. \nThe 45-year insisted Mr Bridgen, who secured a 11,373 majority, in 2015, will 'know he has a fight on his hands.' \nCoun Wyatt lives in Coalville and represents the Warren Hills ward at County Hall. He was first elected at the age of 21. \nLast year, Coun Wyatt was successfully campaigning on the same side as his rival Mr Bridgen in the run up to the European Union referendum. \n'Understanding of local community' \nCoun Wyatt said Tory voters had been asking him to stand against the sitting MP. \n\"I have decided to stand against Andrew Bridgen because I'm sick and tired of North West Leicestershire getting a raw deal,\" he said. \n\"We seem to have an MP who is all talk and no action. \n\"Coalville and the surrounding area needs someone who's passionate about our town and understands the needs of the local community. \n\"Many people from all parties have asked me to stand because they know I can deliver, I am passionate about my town, and I'm not scared to stand up and speak my mind on the important issues people are concerned about. \nPush for a Brexit deal \nCoun Wyatt added: \"My aim is to offer people a chance to vote for someone who will always put them first, and continue to push for a Brexit deal that's allows the country to take back control of our immigration policy which many are concerned about, and push for greater protection for our elderly who have been neglected by this Government and previous governments who have failed to address the need to reform social mobility. \n\"I'm a very independent minded person but my Liberal beliefs are based on allowing people and businesses the freedom to strive in an open and fair market.\" \nAndrew Bridgen's response \nThe Lib Dems were pushed into fourth place in North West Leicestershire behind the Conservatives, Labour and UKIP. \nThey got just over 2,000 votes - 3.9 per cent of the total - after standing a candidate who lived in Cambridge. \nMr Bridgen, who told the Mercury he had not yet decided if he would defend his seat, said: \"I wish Mr Wyatt all the luck in trying to improve his party's share of the vote from three per cent or whatever they got last time. \n\"They lost their deposit in 2015. \n\"The one thing you need to be as a Liberal Democrat is optimistic.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T21:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T18:23:39.978+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
