By Leicester Mercury | Posted: January 17, 2017 0 COMMENTS SHARES Comments (0) \nThis morning will see Theresa May delivering a speech that will outline what version of Brexit the UK government will be pursuing. \nThe Prime Minister will possibly define the country's future relationship with the EU following Britain's decision to leave the European Union. \nDespite Mrs May previously indicating she would like to trigger Article 50 – which will start the formal process of leaving the EU – towards the end of March, few details of what deal she wants to seek have emerged. \nSince the June 23 Referendum, when UK voters chose to leave the 28-nation bloc, debate has been ongoing about what kind of deal the UK will get post-Brexit. \nAlberto Costa MP's Brexit plea to PM 'Don't make me vote to take away my Italian parents' rights' \nDiscussions include whether or not it will be a hard Brexit, which would see the UK leave the European Single Market, or a soft Brexit. \nThe Prime Minister is also expected to call on the nation unite following the referendum – which gave people the choice of voting to leave or remain. \nThe speech, from Lancaster House, will be broadcast on news channels from 11.45am this morning.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T15:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T11:57:26.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
