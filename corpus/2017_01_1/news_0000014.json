They were not referring to Isis or some terrorist organisation, but our judges. Their crime was to apply the rule of law – and the widespread misunderstanding of what this meant. \nThe concern for many Brexit campaigners was that giving a Parliament a say meant that the High Court was denying the referendum result. This anxiety that a long cherished goal of seeing the UK leave the EU could be thwarted led to some of the most extraordinary accusations. They didn’t make a mountain out of a molehill, but took leave of reality as well as their senses. \nThe case was about whether the government or Parliament could trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty launching Britain’s exit from the European Union. \nThe government argued that this was about treaties – and whether we are a part of them. The government is able to make such agreements subject to any expressed view of Parliament. The Prime Minister’s argument was that triggering Article 50 concerned a treaty and so the government had the right to trigger Britain’s Brexit at its pleasure. \nThis argument was rejected by the High Court because this power – like all freedoms – has strings attached. One crucial issue is that if the government got its way then it would effectively cancel out an Act of Parliament, namely the European Communities Act 1972 which incorporated EU law into UK domestic law. Only Parliament has the power to do that and so MPs must have a vote. \nThe government was then quick to appeal to the Supreme Court. Their argument was little more than trying to re-run the same line of argument they tried unsuccessfully before. The result was the same with a 8-3 verdict that the government could not trigger Britain’s Brexit when it wanted, but must gain Parliament’s approval.

There is no concerted will of a majority in Parliament to stop the referendum result. The question was primarily constitutional and it has been answered emphatically. \nOur courts are no enemies of the people – they are champions of our liberties. Some argued the people spoke and Brexit should happen immediately. However, we live in a parliamentary democracy where Parliament is sovereign. Those who wanted Parliament to take back control have their wish – and should celebrate the courts putting Parliament first. \nWe do not live in an elected dictatorship nor a tyranny of the majority. Just because a majority want something doesn’t mean it is anything goes. We live under a rule of law that affords protections to all – and the rule of law is one of Britain’s most cherished and ancient values.

The Supreme Court made clear that the government deserves some blame for the constitutional mess it has created. \nThe Supreme Court noted that the Act of Parliament creating the referendum we held last June was not especially well thought out. That Act said there would be a referendum, but gave no provision to what would happen if the public voted to leave. \nIf the legislation said something like a Leave vote meant Parliament authorised the government to start the UK’s Brexit, then this matter would be resolved from the start. It is the government’s poor planning that has meant extra delay and confusion. But it does not stop there. Prime Minister Theresa May \nThe Conservative Party’s manifesto for the 2015 general election does not say what it would do in government about the referendum result if there was a vote for Brexit. \nHonouring the result can mean many things. While some Leave voters wanted controls on immigration, the EU free movement rules are separate from the EU – countries like Norway have free movement as members of the single market while not being an EU country. \nCampaigners arguing Brexit meant no EU free movement get wrong how free movement works or its legal basis. You’d expect leading parliamentary campaigners to get this right, but there you are. \nIf the Tories made clear their intentions on what any Brexit might mean in their manifesto, then this would help bind the hands of the House of Lords. \nBut because they didn’t, it is unclear what any vote in the House of Lords might look like.
