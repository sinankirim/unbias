Despite this, North East companies continue to see Europe as key, with well over a third looking to put additional resources into the market. \n“In terms of our trading future relationship with the EU, tariffs are the top priority, with North East business prioritising tariffs, expensive non-tariff barriers and public procurement regulations to be at the top of the agenda for our future EU trade deal.” \nInternationally, over a quarter of North East businesses are looking to put more resources into exporting to North America. Similarly, 23% are looking to put more resources into Australasia, 22% to China and 21% to the rest of Asia (excluding India). \nMeanwhile, North East business consider tariffs, non-tariff taxation, and public procurement regulations as the three top priorities for resolution in a Brexit deal.
