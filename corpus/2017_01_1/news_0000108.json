Various Sunday newspapers said Mrs May was heading towards a departure from the single market. \nSterling’s slump in the Asian markets also came after Chancellor Philip Hammond suggested ministers could slash corporation tax rates if Britain was frozen out of the single market. \nMr Hammond told a German newspaper that the Government would do “whatever we have to” to ensure UK businesses would stay competitive. \nDowning Street would not be drawn on reports Mrs May would announce plans to withdraw from the single market and the European customs union during her speech at London’s Lancaster House. \nBut one Sunday paper quoted a government source as saying: “She’s gone for the full works. \n“People will know when she said ‘Brexit means Brexit’, she really meant it.” Prime Minister Theresa May (Photo: PA) Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T14:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T10:12:17.987+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
