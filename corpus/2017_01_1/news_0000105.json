In comparison only 23% of firms believe they will have greater opportunities in 2017. \nWhile companies are realistic about the challenges they face 47% also believe that the UK’s economy will decline over the year. Liz Mayes \nDespite the gloomy outlook for the year ahead business owners are still looking to face the challenges head-on and plan to expand their businesses. \nOver the next year 56% of firms expect to increase productivity while half of companies expect to boost UK sales. \nMs Mayes adds: “In many ways 2017 is likely to be another unprecedented year of change and uncertainty, but the UK manufacturing sector remains ambitious, resilient and adaptable.

The increase in production was boosted by the low value of the pound. \nHowever, 2017 has already seen blows struck to the North East’s manufacturing industry after AEI Cables revealed nearly 250 people are set to lose their jobs when the factory in Birtley is shut down.
