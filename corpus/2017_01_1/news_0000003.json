Over the year Persimmon acquired nearly 19,000 plots of land for development and the firm said it was planning on buying more throughout 2017. \nA Persimmon spokesperson said: “During the year we acquired 18,700 plots of new land in 83 locations with good deferred terms. We continue to see good opportunities to acquire additional land whilst remaining mindful of the risks associated with the uncertainty arising from the UK’s decision to leave the EU. \n“We continue to work hard to bring forward opportunities from the group’s strategic land portfolio which will add to the quality of the group’s asset platform. \n“We expect local authorities to continue to progress their plans to support growth in housing delivery in line with the National Planning Policy Framework.” Read More Newcastle housebuilder Bellway starts buying land again \nThe increase in turnover came as Persimmon upped the number of new homes it build last year as well as selling the properties for a higher price. \nThe housebuilder built 15,171 homes last year and sold them for an average price of £206,000. This is 599, or 4%, more than in 2015 when 14,572 homes were sold at a price of £199,127. \nDespite the healthy results the figure represent a slowdown in the company’s growth. In 2015 revenue was up 13% to £2.9bn and the legal completed sales had grown by 8%. \nPersimmon has hailed a strong performance over the past six months in the face of uncertain conditions caused by the Brexit vote in June. \nIts legal completions rose 9.6% to 7,933 between June and the end of December as it sold 695 more homes than in the first half of the year, while its private sales rate in the second half was 15% higher year on year. \nThe firm also increased its cash in the bank to £913m, up from £570m in 2015.
