As the FTSE 100 hits a record high we ask if the share price rise will continue in 2017 or collapse and plunge us into a financial crisis Share Queues outside Northern Rock in Newcastle - September 2007 (Photo: Ian Clyne) Share Get daily updates   Thank you for subscribing!   \nIs the UK due a stock market crash which could see North East pensions and investments severely hit? \nThe question is beginning to be asked at a time when the FTSE 100, which reveals the value of the 100 largest companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, has hit an all time high of around 7,300. \nHowever before bust comes boom and there are some who fear it might come sooner rather than later. \nMany North East workers have seen their pension pots soar by around 20% in the last 12 months if they were linked to the fortunes of the UK’s ‘blue chip’ companies. \nHowever, history has taught us some bitter lessons. \nIn 2008, the FTSE 100 fell 31% in value compared to 2007 following the banking crisis at the centre of which was Northern Rock. \nLocal memories are still raw about the sight of customers of the North East based financial institution queueing round the block to take out theri cash. \nSo, should we be afraid? John Newlands \nJohn Newlands, Head of Investment Companies Research at Brewin Dolphin’s Newcastle office thinks not. \nHe said: “People shouldn’t be concerned by the fact the FTSE 100 is at an all time high. It always goes up in the long term, although some might find that hard to believe, it has never failed to pay and will never fail to pay in the future. \n“It was at around 6,900 back at the time of the Millennium so the current figure is only 400 points up on that in 15 years.” \nHe said problems can start when, for example, people start “chasing trends”. \nThis was highlighted by the bursting of the dotcom bubble - fuelled by the extraordinary and irrational popularity of online companies which caused the FTSE 100 to fall from 6930 at the end of 1999 to 3287 by March, 2003. \nThe soaring value of shares provides a major boost to people saving for their old age. \nFormer pensions minister Baroness Ros Altmann, said recently: “It’s a great start to 2017 for people’s pensions that the markets are so strong now. \n“Of course markets can go down as well as up but with the economy doing well the £300billion added to the stock market in recent months is bound to be good news for people’s pensions.” Customers queue outside the Northern Rock on Pilgrim Street, Newcastle upon Tyne \nDespite prophecies of doom following Brexit in June last year, after a brief blip the markets roared back. \nExperts say one of the key reasons is that many of the companies, 70% in fact, that make up the FTSE 100 trade in many markets beyond the UK.

His economic stance is clear, he intends to pour money into the US economy, which should have a knock-on effect on world markets. \nThis means shares in the US have soared, and many believe the good fortune will spread around the world meaning a boost to FTSE 100 shares with international interests.
