It is good to know that there will be no half-in half-out arrangement. And that Brexit really does mean Brexit. \nMrs May is right to seek a bold and ambitious trade agreement with the EU and with the rest of the world - to make Britain a global trading nation once again. We have the fastest growing global economy and have bucked dire economic predictions since voting to leave the EU in June. \nMy colleagues and I here in Brussels will work with the Government to do whatever it takes to help secure the best deal for Britain. I am also glad that Britain will seek to retain its friendship with the European Union. We can only hope that the Member States and the European Commission will approach the negotiations in the same spirit of maturity. \nAndrew Lewer MBE \nConservative MEP for the East Midlands Trending", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T12:27:49.647+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
