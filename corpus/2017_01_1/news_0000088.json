Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nLabour Shadow Business Minister Chi Onwurah is to ask her constituents whether she should vote for the Government’s legislation triggering Article 50 and beginning the process of Brexit. \nShe is one of a number of Labour figures who could potentially defy party policy and vote against Brexit. \nThe MP, who represents Newcastle Central, said she would consult constituents, and also wanted to see exactly whet the Government proposed. \nPrime Minister Theresa May surprised the House of Commons by announcing at Prime Minister’s Questions that she will set out her negotiating objectives in a formal document.

Your questions answered \nShe told MPs: “I can confirm to the House that our plan will be set out in a White Paper published in this House.” \nMrs May made clear that she regarded the Article 50 debate as “a separate question” from the publication of what she said would be “a bold vision for Britain for the future”. \nThe PM’s official spokeswoman later said that the White Paper would be published “in due course”, but made no commitment that MPs would see it before the crucial Article 50 vote. \nA Bill to approve the triggering of negotiations will be published today, Thursday. It follows the Supreme Court’s confirmation that Mrs May cannot invoke Article 50 without getting the consent of MPs.

She said on Twitter she was keen to hear constituents’ views, adding: “I’ll be waiting to see government motion before deciding.” \nShadow Business Secretary Clive Lewis, MP for Norwich South, told his local newspaper last week: “I don’t think what is currently on the table, given the irreversibility of Article 50, means that signing Article 50 under these conditions is in the best interests of people in Norwich or the country.” Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T11:09:22.102+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
