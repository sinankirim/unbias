She was basically making sure the exit deal from the EU was discussed and ratified by parliament. \nBizarrely, what Theresa May and her government were doing when they took her on was in effect to challenge the legitimacy of parliament. I know the Tories believe in ‘Small Government’ - but no government?

Sadly it didn’t save them from a fair few ‘hang ‘em high’ editorials.

You would have thought it was something the public which is to be asked to fork out at least £40bn on its renewal should have been informed of. \nBut not a bit of it. The Commons, which was debating and voting on Trident renewal at the time, was kept in the dark.

I was left wondering, and will it take another Gina Miller-type case from a member of the public to find out exactly what motivates our government?
