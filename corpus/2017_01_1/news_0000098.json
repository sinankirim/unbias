Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nDozens of North East MPs have warned Prime Minister Theresa May that her stance on hard Brexit will have a “damaging” impact on the region. \nThe 24 Labour MPs have written to Mrs May with a series of questions about the region’s car making industry after the Prime Minister’s speech last week signalled the UK would not leave both the single market and the customs union when the country pulls out of the European Union. \nThe letter follows comments from Nissan chief executive Carlos Ghosn at the end of last week that the company would have to “re-evaluate” the efficiency of its Sunderland plant after Brexit.

Julie Elliott \n“The Government’s greatest priority in the Brexit negotiations should be protecting jobs, like the many thousands employed by Nissan and its supply chain in the North East. \n“Outside the single market and customs union, jobs will be insecure as there will be new trade barriers between us and our largest trading partner – the EU . There is no mandate for this from voters. It is the Prime Minister’s choice and working people will pay the price.

Prime Minister Theresa May \nIt says that the Goverment’s stance on Brexit ignores submissions from industry and business groups and is “siding instead with the political fantasies of a section of your party.” Read More Nissan will review its Sunderland plant after Brexit, boss says \nIn the letter, Mrs May is asked to guarantee that jobs will not be lost in UK manufacturing as a result of the decision to leave the single market. \nThe MPs add: “We of course accept the result of the referendum, we just reject your interpretation of what it means and want to protect jobs and industry.” \nThe letter is signed by Dave Anderson, Roberta Blackman-Woods, Tom Blenkinsop, Alan Campbell, Ronnie Campbell, Jenny Chapman, Alex Cunningham, Julie Elliott, Pat Glass, Mary Glindon, Helen Goodman, Stephen Hepburn, Sharon Hodgson, Kevan Jones, Ian Lavery, Emma Lewell-Buck, Catherine McKinnell, Ian Mearns, Grahame Morris, Chi Onwurah, Bridget Phillipson, Anna Turley, Phil Wilson and Iain Wright. \nDowning Street has been approached for comment.
