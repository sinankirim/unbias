Group turnover is £24m with the majority driven within the UK. \n“The group will continue to focus on its core objectives, ‘to be the best at what we do’, and ‘to deliver world class services to our customers’. \n“This involves both improving the efficiency of service delivery and increasing both customer satisfaction and profitability. \n“We expect to see strong results for 2016/17 both in terms of sales growth and in terms of profitability.” Read More \nThe firm’s turnover grew by 17.9%, from £20.6m in 2015 to £24.3m last year and headcount increased from 213 to 271 members of staff, a rise of 27%. \nOperating profit also grew by 48% from £511,681 to £761,946. \nThe company’s profit for the financial year fell by £139,000 to £338,000, a fall the firm said was caused by its reduction in its investment in Pacifica Home Services Limited, from 100% to 75%. \nPacifica moved its warehouse distribution centre to Washington after receiving £250,000 investment from The Journal’s Let’s Grow grant, which is run by The Journal in association with BE Group and accountants UNW.

B2C sales currently make up 8% of the business’ income but the firm plans to grow this to 50% over the coming years.
