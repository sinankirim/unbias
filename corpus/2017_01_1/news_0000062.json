Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nAt noon in Washington DC and 5pm GMT on Friday, businessman and celebrity TV star Donald Trump will be sworn in as the 45th President of the United States . \nIt is fair to say the eyes and ears of the world will be on Trump as he takes the Oath of Office and gives his inaugural address. If it is anything like the tone and content of his controversial election campaign, it could make compelling viewing. Will it give any indication as to the priorities of his presidency and how it will evolve? \nHere we outline what it could mean to the North East and the UK. What could our trade links with the US be like under Trump?

And on the face of it that could - possibly - improve with Trump in the White House. He likes to do deals and spoke at the weekend of being eager for new trade deals with the UK. Won’t Brexit put a spanner in the works here? \nOn the contrary it seems. The man Trump is to replace as president, Barack Obama , said the EU referendum result to leave would put us at the back of the queue in regard to trade negotiations with the US. Trump said the opposite, describing himself as a big fan of Brexit. He could have said it just to be different to Obama. Or he could have meant it. Time will tell.

However Trump’s America First policy means that deals will only be done if they benefit the US the most. His stance has seen him reject free trade as well as backing tariffs to protect US industries from what he describes as unfair competition. So expect no favours, even with Nigel Farage as his bosom buddy. Why might his immigration policy cause problems in more ways than one?

Their days could be numbered. What about the cost of US holidays? U.S. Army Sgt. Maj. Gregory Lowery stands in for President-Elect Donald Trump as he walks out onto the West Front of the U.S (Photo: Getty Images North America) \nThere was mercenary talk it might be cheaper as some expected the dollar to lose its value if Trump won the election. This would have meant more dollars for your pound. However Brexit seems to have done for that with sterling losing it value with some experts saying it could soon have parity with both the dollar and the euro. No cheap holidays. Read More Was BuzzFeed's Donald Trump story the first 'post truth' article in news history? And what have those choosing to visit the US got in store for them? \nWell, how can you be subtle about this? Sorry, you can’t. If you’re white with an Anglo Saxon sounding name you’re OK. A white woman, probably OK too but try not to get stuck in a lift with him. \nThen we get into the horrible bit. A year ago Mr Trump called for a ‘total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the US. He has since tempered his attitude - slightly - with a plan to suspending ‘immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safety occur’ but that does not amount to abandoning it. If we’re being frank, British people with Muslim-sounding names may well have to endure increased scrutiny on their arrival in the US. \nNothing like a cheery note to end with. \nWho knows, maybe once in office Trump might come over all moderate.
