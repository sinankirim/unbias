Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThe new head of Newcastle University wants to put his institution into the top 100 universities in the world, reversing a slide down the league tables that has happened in recent years. \nProf Chris Day, who took over as the new vice-chancellor of Newcastle University last week, believes that “for a university like Newcastle to aspire to get into the top 100 in the world is a very realistic ambition”. \nProf Day, who was previously head of the university’s highly rated medical school, took over from Prof Chris Brink, who focussed more on making Newcastle a “civic” university that played a practical role in the region than on its place in the league tables. \nBut with Newcastle now close to falling out of the Top 200 global universities that helps it attract lucrative foreign students, Prof Day is keen to move Newcastle back up in the global rankings. \nThe Times Higher Education rankings - generally considered the definitive list of the best universities around the world - have seen Newcastle fall from 152th in 2010, when the current grading system was introduced, to 190th last year. In that time, Newcastle lost ground to many of its UK counterparts, going from 23rd in Britain to 31st.

When you are 190th in the world rankings and the mid-20s in most UK league tables, it starts to raise questions about that. \n“Without doubt we are world leading in several areas but across the board we’re not in the top 100 in the world, and nowhere near the top 50, in our missions of research and teaching. \n“For me, to be a really world class civic university, which is our strapline, we have to be more academically excellent, which would be reflected in league tables. \n“For a university like Newcastle to aspire to get into the top 100 in the world is a very realistic ambition. \n“When you look at the UK universities in the top 100, it’s not just Oxford and Cambridge, it is good provincial universities, and we should be aiming to be there.” Read More Newcastle University appoints leading business figure as new chair \nProf Day said Newcastle would rise back up the rankings by improving the standard of its research and teaching, but also by doing more to highlight its good work to the global academics who contribute to the university rankings. \nIn an interview with The Journal shortly after taking office, Prof Day said he was likely to be more publicly visible than his predecessor to increase boost Newcastle’s profile and boost its reputation around the world. \nBut Prof Day shared concerns expressed by Prof Brink about the potential problems universities could be caused by Brexit. \nHe said: “How Brexit plays out in terms of movement of students and staff, our ability to play into European research networks, I think they are going to be the key things. \n“I don’t think that’s what Brexit was about. It was about Polish people taking jobs in Peterborough and Brussels supposedly making our laws. \n“But an unintended consequence of Brexit is that universities are stuffed in many of their core missions. So we’ve got to make sure that whatever a Brexit deal looks like that universities are as protected as they can be.” \n* Chris Day interview, page 23.
