Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nOne of the first office buildings to trigger the Quayside revolution has been snapped up by new owners in a deal worth more than £10m. \nSandgate House, which was designed by Ryder Architecture, was one of the first prominent office buildings to feature on the regenerated East Quayside when it was completed in 1997 to provide a base for North East law firm Ward Hadaway, which has since added the adjacent Keel Row House to house its growth. \nNow the building has been sold to a private client of Rougemont Estates for £10.75m, reflecting a net initial yield of 5.88%. \nDouglas Cranston, of capital markets at Knight Frank, marketed the investment on behalf of Legal and General Investment Management Real Assets (LGIM Real Assets), and says there was considerable interest. \n“The disposal of the asset was the perfect litmus test to establish where appetite sits for a prime, securely let office building in Newcastle city centre – post Brexit,” he said. \n“The result shows that against a backdrop of political uncertainty investors continue to target assets that offer a safe haven for equity demonstrated by prime yields hardening further in the city centre. \nTim Russell, fund Manager at LGIM Real Assets, said: “The disposal of Sandgate House marks a successful completion of the business plan for the asset which is testament to the expertise of our asset management team. This timely sale with a strong price achieved will in turn deliver excellent returns to our fund and its investors.” \nThe detached building sits in a prime position amid one of the city’s principal office areas.

With a range of interest from regional, national and foreign equity it provides evidence of how buoyant the market is for the right kit. \n“The real challenge now going forward is the lack of available stock in the market”.
