So what seismic events can we expect in 2017 and how will local businesses cope? \nRecently, we've seen the pound fall to a 31-year low, the FTSE 100 reach a record high, interest rates cut to historic lows and oil prices start to rise. \nMeanwhile, huge question marks hang over the UK's future trading relationships with our European and global partners. \nThese are strange times indeed. \nWith uncertain outcomes in the general elections planned in the Netherlands, France and Germany, and continuing concerns around the fragility of the Italian banks in particular, 2017 could serve up yet further shocks. \nSo how are local businesses reacting? In truth, with great resilience. \nI've detected a real change in approach in recent months. \n\"Even the Bank of England said the economy performed well\" \nShocks to the system are becoming the norm but rather than going into meltdown, business people I speak to are remarkably sanguine. \nWhy is this? One of the reasons is the experience of the financial crash. \nThose businesses who survived the great recession and the consequent credit crunch are leaner and meaner than before. \nMany believe that if they can survive that they can survive anything. \nSecond, they understand that in this strange transition period, business confidence will, in the words of the Chancellor, be on a \"rollercoaster\". \nBusiness people accept this and are focused on what they can influence, rather than what they can't. \nFinally, despite the worst fears of some economists, the UK economy has performed well since the referendum. \nEmployment is strong, house prices are holding up and key surveys indicate that the construction, manufacturing and services sectors are in rude health. \nConsumers are also feeling confident enough about their future prospects to keep spending.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T19:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T16:59:34.781+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
