Yet Transport Secretary Chris Grayling’s initial reaction was to wash his hands of it, his second was to pour petrol on the flames by saying rail union Aslef had threatened 10 years of industrial action when they met. \nGrayling, caught on camera accidentally totalling a cyclist last week, is as much a danger to the whole of Britain’s transport system it seems. \nIt might actually explain May’s comment to Corbyn. Was it actually a cry for help?

The Tories are ideologically opposed to it as they cling like limpets to the notion that private ownership always trumps public ownership no matter what the evidence is. Yet the public are coming round to the idea - a survey last year revealed 59% support for re-nationalising the railways - even Tory voters came out for it in by 48% to 35%. \nOne thing the government can’t blame on the unions is the social care crisis. In the last Parliament the Tories and the Lib Dems cut social care by £3bn, despite them knowing of an aging population with ever more complex needs. \nIt allowed the then Chancellor George Osborne to go ahead with tax cuts for the wealthy while slashing local authority cash to councils who ended up carrying the political and financial responsibility for austerity. \nToday Osborne’s ‘economic plan’ has been officially binned by his successor as a spectacular failure, one of its consequences the growing social care crisis.
