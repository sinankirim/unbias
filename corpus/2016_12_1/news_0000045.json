Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nOne of the North East business community’s leading figures has been appointed to be the next chair of Newcastle University’s governing body. \nFormer Sage Group chief executive Paul Walker, who is now a major investor in the digital technology sector in both the UK and US, will take on the role at Newcastle University’s council from August next year. \nMr Walker - who is a director of Experian plc and sits on the board of US-based Sophos plc - has been a lay member of the university’s council since 2011 and has been the chair of the Science City Partnership between the university and Newcastle City Council since its inception in 2004. \nHe said: “I have been privileged to have been involved with Newcastle University for over a decade through Science City and, more recently, as a council member. \n“During that time I have seen the Science Central site really start to take shape with the £59m Urban Sciences Building nearing completion, the university’s National Centres for Ageing and for Data coming on stream and the Core building now fully occupied with hi-tech firms. \n“I am looking forward to being more involved in the strategic direction of Newcastle University as its new chair of council. There are so many strengths to build on: it has a fantastic research profile associated with world-leading advances in the fields of mitochondrial diseases, English, computing science and many other subjects. \n“The university’s teaching reputation is also strong with consistently excellent feedback from our students both in this country and overseas. However, there are significant challenges to be faced. We need to respond to the implications of Brexit and also the Government’s reforms in university teaching and research.” \nMr Walker will replace Mark I’Anson, who has been the university’s chairman since 2011 and will step down next August.
