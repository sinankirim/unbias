Christmas break By TomPegden | Posted: December 28, 2016 0 COMMENTS SHARES A Lavendon platform being used at the Louvre in Paris Bidding war for Lavendon Group heats up again following Christmas break X \nCopy link to paste in your message / Comments (0) \nThe bidding war for a Leicestershire cherry-picker business has heated up again following the Christmas break. \nTwo European rivals are trying to out-price each other for control of Lutterworth-based Lavendon – parent company of Nationwide Platforms, the UK's biggest powered access hire company. \nLavendon is the market leader in the rental of powered access equipment – or cherry pickers – in Europe and the Middle East. \nIt has 200 staff at its Lutterworth headquarters, with 25 employed at its Cosby depot. \nRaised access specialist Loxam, based in France, has now upped its offer for the business following unsolicited bids from Belgian group TVH. \nRead more: Lavendon to beat profits expectations, despite Brexit uncertainty \nSince then the battle has escalated with Loxam stepping into the fray with the support of the Lavendon board. \nOn December 15, TVH upped its cash offer to 230p a share, but a day later, Lavendon and Loxam came back with a recommended offer of 250p. \nTwo days before Christmas, TVH went to 251p per share. \nYesterday (WEDS) there was a fresh recommendation from Lavendon and Loxam of 260p per share – valuing Lavendon at £442 million. \nThe share price has jumped from 120p at the start of November to 263p today, buoyed on by the interest. \nIn a trading statement Lavendon said: \"The board of Lavendon unanimously intends to recommend that Lavendon shareholders accept this increased Loxam offer and therefore continues to advise that Lavendon shareholders take no action with regard to the revised offer for the company announced by TVH on December 23.\" \nThe board of TVH said: \"TVH is considering its options and urges Lavendon shareholders to take no action in response to the announcement by Loxam. \n\"A further announcement will be made in due course.\" \nIn the UK, Loxam Access is based in Nottingham and operates from 13 branches across England, Scotland and Ireland
