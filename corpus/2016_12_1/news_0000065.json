Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron visits Newcastle \n“Six months on it is clear that the Government has no plan on Brexit and there is a growing appreciation amongst the public of the enormity of the economic damage a Hard Brexit will bring to the NE and to the UK as a whole. \n“Pro Remain North East Labour MPs should take heed of this poll - they need to stand up and be counted, and if that means breaking ranks with their floundering leadership, so be it.” \nAs Mr Farron said, the earliest indication that the Leave campaign was to triumph after the June 23 referendum came in the North East. \nFirst when the Remain campaign just scraped home in Newcastle where they had expected a resounding victory. \nAnd then Sunderland where Leave was this time expected to scrape home but ended up winning by a landslide.
