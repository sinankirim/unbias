He served the people of Ryhope and Sunderland for many years from his work on council committees, his time as the Millennium Mayor in 1999, and his many works in the community. \n“He will always be remembered for his friendly manner, his charm, and how he gave so much of himself for others. \n“Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and his many friends. He is greatly missed.” \nCouncillor Ellen Ball, who served alongside Mr Wares for three years in Ryhope, said she was “devastated” by his passing. \nShe said: “I worked with him as a councillor from 2007 until he retired in 2010 and then I continued working with him in the community. \n“He never gave up on anything or anyone, he was truly the nicest person I have ever met - he cared immensely about Ryhope.” Read More Cancer, Brexit and austerity: the leader of Sunderland Council reveals all \nShe added: “We are all devastated by his passing, he seemed like he was starting to pick up last week. I asked to be text any news as I couldn’t speak about it over the phone.” \nAfter retiring from the council, Mr Wares remained very active in the community as co-chair of the East Voluntary and Community Sector Area Network. \nHe was also chair of Ryhope Community Association, Blue Watch Youth Centre, Durham Heritage Coastal Partnership and also involved with the Gentoo Housing Group, Sunderland Empire, Raich Carter Sports Centre. \nHe was also a supporter of local Ryhope groups such as Ryhope Craft Class, Ryhope Keep Fit Club, Ryhope Sea Angling Club, Ryhope Heritage Society, and others. \nA celebrating the life of Mr Ware is due to take place on December 28 at Sunderland Crematorium.
