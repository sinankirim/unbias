It estimates that turnover will grow by 3.8% to £21.9m and profit will soar 25% to £5.4m. Zytronic's profits have suffered as a result of the European Union vote \nZytronic produces both touch screen and non-touch glass, although the firm has been diversifying away from the latter. Revenue from touch screen glass grew by 5% to £18.2m, while turnover from non-touch glass fell 26% to £2.9m. \nChief executive Mark Cambridge said: “The plan is continuing along the lines of what we have done and continuing to see greater touch screen production and sales. \n“We also want to drive forward into trying to produce the greater volumes of the larger sized products, which our technology is ideally suited to the development of solutions.” \nExport revenues accounted for 95% of the firm’s total turnover. Although the devaluation of the pound impacted the business’s bottom line, Mr Cambridge said that Brexit could be a benefit for Zytronic.

From the point of view of the levels of sales we have done in Asia and North America, it is more than what we have been doing in Europe . \n“If there were trade barriers dropped in North America and Asia we would have a significant benefit.” \nThe business also took advantage of the Patent Box tax rule, which allows companies to apply a lower rate of corporation tax to profits earned from patented inventions. Zytronic has five patents and lowered its total corporation tax bill to 4% for the year. \nZytronic’s directors proposed a final dividend of 10.96p per share, which is up from 8.87p in 2015. Basic earnings per share stands at 26.6p. Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-12-13T21:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-12-13T16:43:09.418+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
