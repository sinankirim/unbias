LOSERS: Tourists Since the UK voted to leave the European Union in June, the UK's currency has been fluctuating in value against other currencies, including the Euro and the dollar (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \nBrexit has already made the cost of going on holiday more expensive. \nA volatile currency market has gone up and down but the general trend has been downward. \nTake travelling to Europe, for example. Read More North East now wants to stay in the European Union according to our Brexit poll \nIn practice, this means that if you changed £500 to Euros at the start of the year you’d have got €680 in return. \nIf you had changed the same amount of money when the pound hit a low, you’d have got a measly €555 back. \nThe pound has recovered slightly recently but as negotiations drag on over 2017 the pound will probably slump even further. \nGoing on holiday could get very pricey next summer. WINNER: UKIP A person wearing a Ukip rosette (Photo: Daniel Leal-Olivas/PA Wire) \nIt’s been a strange few months for UKIP. \nThey’ve had two leadership races, a scandal involving a confrontation between two MEPs and Nigel Farage has alienated many over his friendship with the president elect of the United States. \nFor any other party at any other time this would look like a terrible state of affairs. \nAnd yet, the future looks rosy for the populist insurgents. \nIn his victory speech, UKIP’s new leader, Paul Nuttall, said he wanted to “replace” the Labour party. \nThat’s unlikely but there’s no doubt he’s in a good position to loosen Labour’s grip on places like the North East. \nAs Labour grandee Frank Field put it to The Guardian, Nigel Farage “picked up a million Labour voters by accident”. \nArguably for the first time in their history, and without Europe dominating their field of vision, UKIP have a target - and a wounded one at that. \nThe Labour party is hobbling and across the country voters are turning away. \nUKIP have a very real chance of turning that into success on councils and perhaps in constituencies across the North East. \nWhich brings us to... LOSER: The Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, speaking at the Labour Party Annual Conference 2016 (Photo: Daily Mirror) \nThe North East belongs to an increasingly rare species: the Labour stronghold. \nThere’s not a single Tory MP between Stockton and Hexham. \nBut in a post-Brexit world things look less straight forward. \nLabour, who are hitting historic lows in national polls, have yet to formulate a coherent Brexit policy and have been hampered by turmoil in the party since the result. \nBroadly speaking, Labour favour some sort of soft-Brexit, although they are vague on the details. \nJeremy Corbyn and the rest of the party leadership have remained relatively coy on what they would like to see post 2019 and have at times been outshouted by those in the party who want to see a second referendum. \nThe result is that they’re simultaneously pleasing no one and angering everyone. \nLabour voters who backed Remain, particularly in London, want to see the party commit to offering a second vote and are looking to the vocally pro-Europe Liberal Democrats. \nBut Labour voters who opted for Leave in places like the North East are turning to UKIP and the Tories to make sure what they voted for is actually delivered. \nThe type of wipe-out the party experienced in Scotland remains a remote possibility but the North East will certainly be more competitive now, especially if Theresa May calls a snap general election. \nFollowing the resignation of Corbyn-critic Jamie Reed in Copeland, Cumbria, there’ll be a crucial by-election in the coming months. \nDemographically similar to parts of the North East, Copeland could act a pretty good indicator of how Labour will perform in the coming years in the North East. \nLabour have held the seat since 1983 - William Hill have the Tories 5/4 favourites to win it.
