Sunderland Council leader Paul Watson at home \nThankfully, Councillor Watson sought a second opinion: “I went to an oncologist at the RVI who said ‘It’s up to you how long you can live’ - it just gave you so much faith in yourself.” \nSince then the spread of the cancer has been halted and the outlook is better but the odds of a full recovery are low. \nHe said: “You’ve got to be pragmatic about life - I’m 62, I will die sometime. \n“I could have died 10 years ago when I had a kidney transplant. \n“If it happens, it happens, there’s not much you can do about it.” \nWork and routine, he says, have become a big part of his recovery by providing the structure he needs to avoid despair. \nHe said: “I know the tablets I have to take, I know the hospitals I have to go to, I know the adjustments to my life I have to make. \n“If I dwelt on it and just took to my bed I think I would pass away in a matter of a few months. \n“I have something which is testing and troubling and pushing me all the time. \n“It’s part of what is keeping me alive.” \nThat quality of rugged persistence and pragmatism is a recurring theme when speaking to Coun Watson - and as the leader of Sunderland City Council, it’s a quality he has need in spades. \nThe former shipyard worker entered politics after completing a degree in law in his early forties. \nFirst elected in 1997 as part of a wave of centre-left optimism against the backdrop of a booming economy, the timing of his rise to become leader could hardly have been less fortuitous. Sunderland Council leader Paul Watson at home \nHe said: “I became leader of the council in 2008 which coincided quite nicely with the world economic crash and the subsequent austerity so I’ve led this city council through probably the darkest economic times we’ve had since the war. \n“There isn’t great pleasure in having to reduce budgets but, as a socialist, I feel there is an element of satisfaction in being able to manoeuvre the situation to ensure we still look after the least well off as best we can.” \nRunning a council suffering fresh budget cuts every year requires, he says, a “pragmatic socialism”: “You come with a direction of travel and I think in terms of empowering people. \n“You just look at each issue and problem as it comes to you and look for solutions. \n“By and large, when you’ve got a choice between the devil and the deep blue sea, you have to eschew the devil and learn to swim.” \nAnd through this adapt or die mentality, Coun Watson says, he and his colleagues have managed to avoid drowning: “We’ve got a lot of experience at this now - we can shimmy and shake and twist and turn to make the best out of what we’ve got. \n“We’ve learned to do that - we have had to manoeuvre and manipulate otherwise we would have been dead.” Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-12-18T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-12-18T11:37:41.270+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
