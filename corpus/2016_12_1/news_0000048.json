Talking to other new mums and dads, some greet the arrival of their children into a changing world with a sense of trepidation – Christmas in particular should be a time for optimism – but I’m confident that nationally Britain should be optimistic about Brexit, while locally this will be a year Boston makes further progress towards delivering the much-needed Flood Barrier, Skegness will see further economic growth and, in areas in between, such as in Wainfleet we will see continuing investment in flood defences. \nThere are, of course, challenges we need to grasp, whether that’s making sure the police have the resources they need to tackle rural crime in particular, or continuing to make sure Britain takes a central place on the world stage. But as the American Ambassador said when he visited Boston, few places demonstrate Britain’s varied history as well as Lincolnshire. So – after a brief break from the turkey – let’s face the new year, remember that great heritage, and learn from the past to seize the day.
