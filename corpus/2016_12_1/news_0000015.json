into a project which will see us completely refurbish the Grove Park offices. \n\"There will be a bit of disruption while the work is being done, but there's genuine excitement about what we are going to create in terms of the new office environment.\" \nTopps Tiles has been based there for 12 years, and has 270 staff on site, split between the office and a big warehouse. \nMr Williams said: \"It's a big transformation and we will certainly be using our products because one of the key wishes is to have the offices dripping with product, really bringing it to life.\" \nRead more: Topps Tiles

our new look headquarters. \n\"The refurbishment will offer our employees a much more contemporary and creative space to work in, ensuring we can always retain our title of being the UK's number one tile specialist.\" \nGareth Costello is associate director of building services consultants BSD, in Highcross Street, Leicester, which has been working on the plans for updating the services such as lighting and heating. \nHe said: \"Topps understands the value of an inspiring workspace. \n\"The new office will provide the staff with an energy efficient, open, flexible working environment and BSD
