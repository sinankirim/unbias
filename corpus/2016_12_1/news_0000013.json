Despite repeated claims that Labour lacked sufficient border controls, net migration has never been higher than since the Tories promised to bring it down. This post-truth politics of saying one thing but doing another fools no one. \nThis problem could be partly avoided by a better means of counting the number of migrants to restore the public’s faith in the immigration system. Net migration counts many people as ‘migrants’ like 80,000 British citizens and many more full-time foreign students at our top universities – people that few consider migrants. \nIt is fundamentally wrong to have an immigration target where the government can reach its goals by encouraging more British citizens to leave or not come back so that ‘net migration’ can be reduced. This is not what the public voted for when it wanted to take back control with Brexit. \nPledges to reduce numbers mean little when they are routinely missed – and they don’t hit the real issue. Migrants bring many benefits in shaping modern Britain beyond their contributions to the economy through paying taxes or student fees, but these are not cost-free and this is too readily overlooked. Voters are making clear long before Brexit that they have concerns with how poorly successive governments have helped support creating cohesive communities despite population changes. \nDame Louise Casey’s new report on integration is long overdue. Theresa May deserves credit for helping commission it over a year ago when she was Home Secretary. Many of its findings are welcome, but it should have gone much further. Louise Casey (Photo: Newcastle Journal) \nFirst, Dame Louise is correct to prioritise the promotion of English skills. A shared language is the key to creating a sense of community. The government could improve cohesiveness if it was more pro-active in better providing support to areas that require it most urgently. Real term cuts for English support since 2010 has been counterproductive. \nIt’s a mistake to think that only migrants are in need. Why not support British citizens as well? Too many in Britain are functionally illiterate – possibly as high as 16% of the adult population. If English proficiency is a good thing for gaining employment or integrating communities, support shouldn’t be restricted to migrants but made available for citizens old and new alike. So let’s see more support for all, rather than a few. This will benefit all in Britain and help bring us together. The government’s review should have recognised this better instead of being too narrow. \nSecondly, the Casey Review recommends schools and local communities work more closely together to provide opportunities for pupils to mix with others from diverse backgrounds. More can and should be done. British values should receive greater attention in classrooms – even if it seems bureaucrats, and not the British public, are the ones defining what these values are. This democratic deficit should be addressed. These proposals in the Casey Review should go much further. Bringing together people from a local area has many benefits for breaking down barriers between neighbours. Communities should be isolated from each other or unable to come together. \nYet these plans can also be more ambitious and extend to the country as a whole. Our young people should see more of what makes Britain great beyond their backyards alone. Let’s have a more open horizon – and help bring our country closer. \nFinally, Dame Louise supports reviewing the route to British citizenship. This is long overdue, as I’ve argued for some time. The last review was completed over 10 years ago by Sir Bernard Crick, at the invitation of his former university pupil, the then Home Secretary David Blunkett. Yes, that long ago. Read More I am an immigrant - and my life has to be a series of trade-offs \nCrick’s report came to similar conclusions about language, values and integration that we find in Casey’s Review – and with some different policy recommendations. While not all Crick’s proposals took hold, none have been subjected to any review since and long overdue. \nAs the Casey Review makes clear, its time has now come. Migrants should expect better than a bad pub quiz for a citizenship test – and citizens deserve greater confidence in how the immigration system works for all, rather than only a few. This could herald a more fair and trusted policy that the public craves, and waits for its deliverance. \nTheresa May deserves credit for commissioning this review on integration. And while the Casey Review has its flaws, it should not become an opportunity missed to tackle this most pressing of public concerns. The sooner we have a national conversation about migration and citizenship, the better – and we can’t wait much longer. \nThom Brooks is Head of Durham Law School and author of Becoming British (Biteback 2016) @thom_brooks Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-12-20T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-12-19T20:22:33.497+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
