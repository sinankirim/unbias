Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThe triumph of climate-change sceptic President-elect Donald Trump will not halt the global low-carbon energy transition, say North East experts. \nBranding climate change ‘a Chinese conspiracy’ President-elect Trump looks set to unleash a new era of US fossil fuel development - as many global experts were predicting its demise. \nShares in US coal companies have soared since last Tuesday’s momentous result wth President-elect Trump branding greens ‘tree huggers’ and saying renewables will be second in line to US coal, oil and gas. \nThe President-elect also says he will withdraw the US from the 2016 Paris Agreement punching a major hole in global attempts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. \nFriends of the Earth North East regional campaign coordinator Simon Bowens said his election is ‘undoubtedly a major set-back’ for global efforts to switch to low-carbon fuel, power and heating systems. \nHe said: “He is likely to appoint climate change deniers into key environment and energy positions, back coal and oil corporations, and try to pull-back from the Paris climate agreements. \n“However, there are limits to how much damage he can do, because many things are now unstoppable. \n“China will not stop investing in renewables – they’re essential to counter the appalling coal-fired, air-pollution in their cities. \n“Solar and wind power have plummeted in cost, and continue to do so, and are being deployed at record rates all over the world, including many Republican states. \n“Corporations, pension funds and banks are increasingly investing in clean, not dirty energy. He cannot easily pull out of the Paris Agreement – the rules mean it would take him four years to do so, by which time there will be a new president. One man cannot wreck the planet, no matter how powerful.” Read More Why Donald Trump supporters aren't all mysogynistic white supremacists \nLast year’s Paris Agreement saw almost 200 countries agree to aim to limit global temperature rises by adopting policies to cut carbon emissions. \nIn order to help the US achieve this US President Barack Obama has drafted the Clean Air Act which aims tackle emissions by shutting down many of the nation’s coal power plants \nJon Bird, former head of sustainability at Northern Powergrid, a visiting professor of practice at Newcastle University and an associate with Sustainability First, says he is ‘trying to remain optimistic’ following last week events. \n“On the positive side, in the last month three things have happened. The Paris agreement has been ratified by 55 countries – far faster than the Kyoto agreement which took seven years – and there have been global agreements on the climate impact of aviation and phasing out hydrofluorocarbons. \n“None of these got much publicity. In the US, Congress has always opposed limiting carbon emissions, which is why Obama had to take executive action. \n“And the UK Government is still committed to meeting its emissions reduction targets. Inevitably, as targets get tougher more attention gets paid to the cost and not every initiative will be a success. \n“But, both in the UK and globally, we have come a long way in the last few years and we continue to make progress, regardless of attitudes in the US. We cannot give up.” \nMany have criticised the Conservative Government for axing subsidies for some renewable such as solar and onshore wind, with many saying this has cast doubts over its commitments to act on the perceived threat of global warming. \nBut Business Secretary Greg Clark last week committed the UK Government to its carbon reduction targets, which are some of the most stringent in the world, while Climate Change Minister Nick Hurd confirmed coal would be removed from UK power generation in the next decade. \nPhil Hewitt, director of Yarm-based energy sector data monitoring company Enappsys, said: “Coal is struggling at the moment in the market because of the increasing EU environmental legislation and from the UK’s policy of a carbon price floor. \n“Coal will be all but gone by 2025 as to continue will require further capital investment and the current policy framework gets in the way of that getting funded.” Read More Why Donald Trump and Brexit wins could prove to be a good thing \nAnd contrasting the UK’s position with that of the President-elect he continued: “His response is driven partly by appeals to old coal towns which are suffering. Unfortunately it is not renewables that is killing coal but shale gas. \n“President Obama has funded a few green initiatives but most are funded or controlled at the state level and so there is less of an opportunity to impact policy there. As an example one thing on the ballot in Florida was a widely criticised anti-solar amendment to the Florida constitution, it failed. \n“On a national level, the US can walk away from the Paris agreement but even with the US boycotting it the agreement is ‘over the line’ and in force. \n“The US can leave but the rest of the world can continue to implement. It is damaged if the US leaves, but not dead. \n“The global low carbon shift is in process and cannot be stopped, the US can just turn up late to the party at a disadvantage if they want. Interestingly in the southern states solar is now a cost competitive option, offshore wind may struggle without federal support, but solar will only grow.” \nMr Bowens added: “Politicians ultimately reflect what people want but we must not allow the chilling effect of a Trump presidency to affect us here in the UK. \n“That involves standing up against growing intolerance here, and demanding stronger, not weaker, action on climate change.” \nFollow Peter McCusker on Twitter @mccusker60 Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-11-17T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-11-16T20:48:28.683+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
