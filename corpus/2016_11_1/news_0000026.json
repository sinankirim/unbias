X \nCopy link to paste in your message / Comments (1) \nBrexiteer MP Andrew Bridgen says a High Court ruling that the Government must seek MPs' approval to start the process of Britain leaving the European Union could trigger a General election. \nPro-EU Campaigners were celebrating victory in the legal battle against Prime Minister Theresa May's decision to use the royal prerogative in her Brexit strategy, with demands for her to now set out her negotiating strategy to MPs. \nThree senior judges ruled that the Prime Minister does not have power to use the prerogative to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty to start the two-year process of negotiating Brexit without the prior authority of Parliament. \nWithin minutes of the ruling by Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, International Development Secretary Liam Fox told the House of Commons that the Government will appeal to the Supreme Court. \nRead more: MPs want fines imposed on cheating bankers to pay for Â£11.3m Leicester Cathedral revamp \nAnd a Government spokesman said: \"The Government is disappointed by the Court's judgment. The country voted to leave the European Union in a referendum approved by Act of Parliament. And the Government is determined to respect the result of the referendum. \n\"We will appeal this judgment.\" \nNorth West Leicestershire Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, who led the East Midland's campaign to quit the EU, said: \"It is right they are appealing. The British people told us, in the referendum, what they want and MPs should make sure that happens. \n\"There is not a majority of pro-Brexit MPs in parliament. \n\"If MPs vote not to trigger Article 50 I think we will have to have a general election.\" \nHe stressed it was the duty of MPs to represent their constituents' views. \nIn the referendum vote, in June, the national result was that 51.89 per cent of voters wanted to quit the EU and 48.11 voted to remain. \nRead more: Commons speaker John Bercow orders Andrew Bridgen to 'desist' from raising Keith Vaz concerns \nPro-Remain Loughborough Tory MP Nicky Morgan tweeted: \"Right that Parliament should vote on legislation to trigger Article 50. Sovereignty regained from EU should go to sovereign UK Parliament.\" \nUnless overturned on appeal at the Supreme Court - or at a potential further appeal to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg - the ruling threatens to plunge the Government's plans for Brexit into disarray as the process will have to be subject to full parliamentary control. \nThe Supreme Court is understood to have set aside time in early December to hear the Government's appeal, Mrs May's official spokeswoman told a Westminster media briefing. \nA minister will spell out the Government's position in a statement to Parliament on Monday. \nMrs May will not deliver the statement herself, as she will be away on a long-planned trip to India. \n\"Our plans remain to invoke Article 50 by the end of March,\" said the PM's spokeswoman. \"We believe the legal timetable should allow for that.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-11-03T19:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-11-03T15:55:46.137+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
