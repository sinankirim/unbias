Could   \nPlans to float part of the North East’s second largest company have been abandoned because of Britain’s vote to leave the European Union. \nGerman railways giant Deutsche Bahn had announced plans earlier this year to raise up to £3.6bn with a partial flotation of Sunderland public transport firm Arriva . \nThe state-owned Deutsche Bahn had planned to float up to 45% of Arriva on the London Stock Exchange, as well as part of its logistics unit Schenker. \nBut chief executive Ruediger Grube told news agency DPA that he will inform directors in December that he cannot recommend the initial public offering (IPO). \nMr Grube said that “unfortunately, the world has changed fundamentally as a result of Brexit ,” pointing to the pound’s collapse following the June 23 referendum vote.

It employs 45,000 people with its base at the Doxford International Business Park in Sunderland. \nThe company was founded as TSK Cowie in Sunderland in 1938 as a second-hand motorcycle dealer. It was later re-launched as a car dealership and also added vehicle hire before taking advantage of bus de-regulation in the 1980s to become a major transport company in the UK. \nThe firm was re-branded as Arriva in 1997 and was bought by Deutsche Bahn in 2010, at which point it was de-listed from the Stock Exchange. Now the company operates rail and bus services in 14 European countries, Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-11-04T22:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-11-04T18:03:10.194+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
