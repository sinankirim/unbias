President-elect Donald Trump speaks during an election night rally \nKey swing states including Florida, Ohio and North Carolina plumped for the controversial Republican. \nTrump even pulled off a one-point win in Pennsylvania, making him the first Republican to win the state since George HW Bush in 1988. \nTrump’s victory was evidently made official with the Wisconsin result. \nThe projected victory took him past the 270 electoral college votes he needed to win the election. \nIt has been Democratic since 1988, though the Republicans came very close to winning in 2000 and 2004. Barack Obama secured a convincing 7-point win in 2012. \nIt has been a devastating defeat for Clinton, who did not go to her campaign HQ.
