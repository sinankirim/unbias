Many thousands of Muslims have suffered brutally because of their evil.\" \nHe added: \"Though our imams are working endlessly to quash the baseless Daesh propaganda, it is sadly often said that Muslims are not vocal enough. \n\"This is therefore a great opportunity to put this misconception to rest. \n\"In a display of unity, we can show everyone that Muslims are vehemently against \nextremism more than anyone else because Daesh's violence is 'Not in our Name'.\" \nAt present, Iraq's army is making steady but slow process in operations to retake Mosul from IS, which has been losing territory under pressure from its various enemies in the region. \nDr Hussain said: \"Unfortunately, there have been cases of people with connections to Leicester joining Daesh, though it has not been a massive problem here. \n\"That is why we need to be more proactive as well as reactive. Daesh is a burning house. It is struggling but as it struggles its message becomes more desperate.\" \nIt is intended that following the Leicester launch, partners in other parts of the UK will spread the message further.
