  \nFormer Prime Minister Gordon Brown has backed moves to devolve more powers to regions like the North East. \nSpeaking at an event in London on Thursday Mr Brown argued in the aftermath of Brexit there needed to be a more federalised UK. \nMr Brown, who left Downing Street in 2010, said that powers should be repatriated from Brussels not to Whitehall or Westminster but to regions like the North East. \nThis could entail greater devolution of power over policy, fisheries, agriculture and social funds, but would also present an opportunity for regions to determine their own social justice priorities. \nHe said: “We need wholesale reform because today the United Kingdom appears united in name only. \n“Politically, the strains of Brexit are already showing, as different nations, regions, sectors and companies desperately seek their own opt-outs from a hard Brexit and call for their own à la carte version of Brexit. \n“Economically, the vote on June 23 revealed that Britain is becoming two nations divided – a highly-prosperous South East and a permanently struggling North – with London effectively decoupling from the economy of the rest of the UK.” \nChronicleLive understands Mr Brown has asked Newcastle City Council leader Nick Forbes to join him, London Mayor Sadiq Khan and Carwyn Jones, First Minister of Wales, for talks over what those seeking greater devolved powers should be pushing for. \nMr Brown told Mr Forbes: “It makes sense to work with regions and nations to deal with the consequences of Brexit and the danger of increased centralisation in Whitehall.” Read More Theresa May's new Northern Powerhouse will include the North East \nHe added: “Whatever the regions and nations ultimate ambitions are for their own future, it makes sense to work together on issues where they have a common interest, especially in devising economic policies more suitable to their needs and aspirations.” \nNewcastle Council leader Nick Forbes said: “The regions must be on guard for any plot by Whitehall to use Brexit to undermine or reverse even the small steps we have seen towards devolution. \n“That is why we must work together, especially in the north, to stop any further centralisation of powers in London. \n“I will be working with the former Prime Minister on our aim of ensuring that the needs of the regions are addressed by the regions themselves, not by a power-hungry Whitehall. “ Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-11-03T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-11-03T15:34:38.216+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
