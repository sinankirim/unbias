What is the biggest shock of 2016 – Donald Trump, Brexit or Leicester... X \nCopy link to paste in your message / Comments (1) \nThe world might be reeling from the news that Donald Trump will be the next American President but Leicester City winning the league remains a bigger shock. \nAn online poll carried out this morning in the immediate wake of the US election outcome still has the Foxes victory as more of a surprise. \nThe Twitter poll by Oddschecker , a national betting comparison site, asked what was the biggest shock win - Mr Trump's, Leicester City's or the Brexit camp's in the EU referendum . \nThe vote had 65 per cent as Leicester as the biggest shock, with 28 per cent going for Trump and 7 per cent voting for Brexit. \nRoss Whent, a spokesman for Oddschecker: \"You might have thought that the morning when the Trump win was confirmed that people's reaction would be one of massive shock and that might top our poll. \n\"But despite the obvious Trump shock factor, Leicester City winning the Premier League will go down as a bigger surprise. \n\"It is still one of the greatest shocks in sporting history, if not the greatest.\" \nClaudio Ranieri's team were 5000-1 to lift the tile, Donald Trump's had been quoted at 250-1 to win while a Brexit vote was unexpected but at odds of 4-1. \nThe Leicester City win cost the bookies millions and so has the Trump victory. \nBookies bet365 said they had suffered losses of over £4m with Hillary Clinton failing to beat Mr Trump. \nSteve Freeth, a spokesman for bet365, said \"We've had some major surprises in 2016 with Leicester City and Brexit, but this just about 'Trumps' the lot. \n\"In-Play was extremely reminiscent of Brexit with Trump reaching double figures before the Midwest States started to declare. \n\"The rest is history, leaving us with our worst result ever on this type of 'specials' market.\" \nThe Foxes are riding high in the Champions League where they are 40/1 to win the competition. \nHowever, as defending champions in the Premier League, the team has a bad start to the season and are priced at 750-1 to retain their title. \nFore more info go to: www.oddschecker.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-11-09T18:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-11-09T14:28:26.121+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
