Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nTheresa May’s “remarkable” intervention to personally reassure Nissan that Britain would secure tariff-free access to European markets helped secure new investment at its Sunderland plant , the Japanese ambassador has said. \nKoji Tsuruoka said the Prime Minister’s decision to invite Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn to Downing Street for talks last month was seen as a “strong commitment of goodwill” by the Japanese car manufacturer. \nHe also said ministers’ commitment to securing tariff free-access to European Union markets was key in Nissan’s decision to invest in the production of two new models in Sunderland. Prime Minister Theresa May \nAppearing before the Lords EU External Affairs Sub-Committee, Mr Tsuruoka said: “I don’t know what are the assurances or what are the conditions that the UK Government might have presented them. \n“Again this is a business decision, we are not involved. \n“But having had the Prime Minister deal with the president of Nissan is in itself a remarkable engagement by the UK Government. \n“And therefore I interpret this as a strong commitment of goodwill on the part of the host Government for Nissan and you might have seen, of course, in the Press that there are certain issues they have discussed and most of them I believe to the satisfaction of both sides. \n“So that is what led Nissan to continue maintaining the 7,000 employees they directly employ, and a few thousand more, the many multiple-fold of indirect employment they generate.” Nissan in Sunderland \nDuring the hearing, Mr Tsuruoka reiterated Japan’s wish for the UK to secure tariff-free trade, particularly for its car manufacturers which rely on EU-wide supply chains. \nHe also continued to call for transitional arrangements to be put in place once a Brexit deal is reached to stop Japanese companies facing a “shock” change in trading conditions. \nAnd he suggested Japan would be able to more easily strike a post-Brexit free trade deal with the UK if it submits to EU regulations to be set out in the Japan-EU Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) currently being negotiated.
