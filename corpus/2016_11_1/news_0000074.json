Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nFormer Chancellor George Osborne believes his Northern Powerhouse project still has the ability to transform the North East and says it will be needed more than ever after the vote to leave the EU. \nMr Osborne was in Newcastle today in his new role as chairman of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, a thinktank he formed in an attempt to keep the project at the top of the political agenda. \nHe met civic and business leaders on Tyneside before touring the new Science Central site on the edge of the city centre and seeing plans for Newcastle University’s Urban Sciences centre. \nHe said the meeting had provided ideas to get the North East working more closely with other parts of the North, and acknowledged concerns that many people in the North East felt the Powerhouse initiative was not benefiting their communities. \nMr Osborne, whose Tatton constituency is close to Manchester, said his Northern Powerhouse work had been helped by a number of Labour council leaders in the region and expressed his optimism that a devolution deal for Newcastle, North Tyneside and Northumberland could still go ahead after the collapse of the process in the wider North East. \nHe also acknowledged that the campaign to remain in the EU had failed particularly in the North East, which backed Brexit as a region by one of the largest margins in Europe . \n“The campaign was not good enough,” he said. “What I’m trying to do now I’m not in Government, I want to listen and learn and understand why it is that communities didn’t want to work with other countries in the EU.

There will be an economic impact. We saw that this week with a big increase in borrowing and a hit to economic growth but the best antidote to that is to make sure we have the closest possible ties with the European Union we’re not part of, but also to ensure we’re building things like the Northern Powerhouse. \n“People clearly felt that the system wasn’t delivering for them. The answer to that is to make sure it does. Former Chancellor George Osborne \n“It’s not surprising after we had such a massive economic crash 10 years ago that, not just here but in many other countries around the world, people are feeling economically insecure. \n“The best answer to that, in my view, is not to erect barriers and build walls, it’s to try and embrace the future and bring jobs and investment. I think we can do that in the North of England and we hope that will be felt by communities in the North East and they will see their living standards rise.
