The market is geared in their favour - huge demand from first-time buyers and a lack of supply - which they control. \n“In fact being a housebuilder right now in Britain, with ultra-low interest rates and Help to Buy, is a licence to print money. A chronic shortage of housing means they can rely on rock solid demand whatever the economic conditions.” \nLast month Newcastle housebuilder Bellway posted record results for a seventh year in a row, with revenues rising 26.9% to £2.24bn and annual profits increasing 40.6% to £497.9m. \nBarratt Developments also announced its full-year results last month, booking a 21% rise in pre-tax profit to £682.3m. \nThe housebuilder increased completions by 5.3% to 17,319 homes in the year to June – its highest total in eight years.
