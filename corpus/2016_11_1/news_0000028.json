Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThe farming industry has a “fantastic opportunity” to build a brand new agricultural policy that works for Britain, farming minister George Eustice has told a conference in Northumberland . \nSpeaking at the Northern Farming Conference in Hexham this week , Mr Eustice - a prominent Brexit campaigner in June’s referendum - said the process of leaving the EU would give the agricultural industry the chance to the “hopeless bureaucracy” imposed by Europe. \nHe was speaking as more than 200 conference delegates at Hexham Auction Mart were urged by speakers to pull together and “work as one” to build a better farming policy for Britain after Brexit. \nFarmers at the event were urged to lobby MPs to ensure agriculture remained at the top of the political agenda, focus on creating a collective British brand and “make British agriculture great again”. \nMr Eustice said: “ The EU got it wrong because it attempted to codify every single feature of the landscape and every single thing a farmer does with his land, which made it hopelessly bureaucratic. The weakness of the EU schemes is that if they get it wrong it takes seven years to sort it out. We need to be much sharper. \n“The question is how best we can support agriculture. If we want good policy it needs to be rooted in good ideas. We need to remove the blinkers of EU membership and work together to build a policy that a decade from now the world will want to emulate. I am confident we can do that. \n“I think this is a fantastic opportunity for our industry going forwards. It is the chance of a lifetime and I am looking forward to building a brand new agricultural policy that works for us.” Former president of the NFU, Sir Peter Kendall \nAlso speaking at the event was Sir Peter Kendall, chair of the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board and a former president of the NFU. \nHe said: “I want to build a future for our rural community, a future that works. We have to make the challenges and opportunities presented by Brexit work for us. I would stake my farm on the fact there is not going to be more money. We need to plan for less support and more competition.” \nHe urged farmers to use the time before Brexit to consider the threats and opportunities ahead, saying: “Think about your farm business very carefully See where you sit among your peers, and your global competitors. Make plans. Go to your MP’s surgery and talk to them; make sure that farming is at the front of their minds. It is vital we get this right.” \nAlso speaking at the conference were Northumberland potato farmer Anthony Carroll; agricultural economist Professor David Harvey; David Blacker, AHDB Monitor Farmer for York; Cumbrian dairy farmer Robert Craig; James Thornton, Wagyu beef producer and managing director of pullet rearing business Wot-an-Egg and Wot-a-Pullet. \nRobert Sullivan of Strutt & Parker, one of the event’s sponsors, said: “What is remarkable about some of the stories we have heard is the success that can and does lie in farming. \n“At a time when many farms are unprofitable without farm payment support it is clear that there are some trailblazing farmers who are demonstrating that agriculture can be profitable without subsidy. They are a huge inspiration.” Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-11-11T22:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-11-11T18:09:00.229+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
