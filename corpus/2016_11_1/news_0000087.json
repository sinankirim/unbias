Minister for Americas Sir Alan Duncan on Nigel Farage becoming ambassad... X \nCopy link to paste in your message / Comments (0) \nMinister for Europe and the Americas Sir Alan Duncan has said Nigel Farage will never be Britain's ambassador to the US. \nPresident Elect Donald Trump has set a hare running with a tweet suggesting the interim UKIP leader would do \"a great job\" representing Britain's interests in Washington DC once the tycoon's administration takes over at the White House in January. \nMr Trump tweeted his support for the idea of Mr Farage as Britain's top diplomat in the USA - an idea apparently conceived by UKIP supporters after the two politicians shared a platform during the presidential campaign. \nUKIP East Midlands MEP Roger Helmer has also poked the embers of the rumour. \nRead more: Council officials seize speakers and microphones from noisy Leicester Conservative Club \nHe said: \"It's worth bearing in mind the significant part that Nigel Farage played in the Trump Campaign - advising on strategy and bringing the aura of Brexit success. \n\"I see that one blogger suggested that Nigel would be ideal as British Ambassador to the 'Court of The Donald'. \n\"A great idea - Theresa May might like to give it some thought.\" \nSir Alan, Tory MP for Melton and Rutland is however having none of it. \nWhen asked by the Mercury if he thought Mr Farage could be UK ambassador to the US Sir Alan said: \"Never. We do not need Nigel Farage as an intermediary between the UK and the US. \n\"The Governments of both countries work together closely as a matter of course. \n\"And as the Prime Minister has said there is no vacancy.\" \nSir Alan pointed out that the UK already had an 'brilliant' ambassador to the US in Sir Kim Darroch, a former National Security Advisor and UK Permanent Representative to the European Union from 2007 to 2011, representing UK interests in areas such as enlargement. \nTory MPs have said it would be unthinkable to have an opponent of the Government as its representative in the US but some pundits have suggested Theresa May could give Mr Farage role to remove him as a thorn in the side of the Government. \nMr Farage is close to Donald Trump and is thought to have his ear but he has no experience as a diplomat and even said himself diplomacy was not one of his strengths.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-11-22T20:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-11-22T15:57:00.682+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
