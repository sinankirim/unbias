Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nIt seems Brexit is turning into an extended episode of Blackadder Goes Forth as both concern a fight over Europe that enjoy moments of high farce with grisly consequences. \nJust last week a leaked memo claiming the Government had no coherent plan regarding the UK leaving the European Union rang loud bells for fans like me of the Blackadder series set in the First World War. \nParticularly the Government’s response to the memo which was, yes, it did have a plan ... somewhere ... while frantically patting each of its pockets in a vain bid to find it. \nIt brought to mind the Blackadder scene when General Melchett tells Blackadder the army’s battle plans have been stolen. \n“You look surprised, Blackadder,” said Stephen Fry’s Melchett. \n“I certainly am, sir,” replied Blackadder, aka our very own Rowan Atkinson. “I didn’t realise we had any battle plans.” \n“Well, of course we have!” shouted Melchett. “How else do you think the battles are directed?” \n“Our battles are directed, sir?” Rowan Atkinson in the 1989 BBC comedy 'Blackadder Goes Forth' (Photo: BBC) \n“Well, of course they are, Blackadder, directed according to the Grand Plan.” \n“Would that be the plan to kick out all immigrants until everyone’s been re-patriated except Field Marshal Haig, Lady Haig and their tortoise, Alan?” \n“Great Scott!” exclaims Melchett. “Even you know it!” \nWell I used a bit of artistic license with that last bit but not much. It’s fair to say that Donald Trump becoming King of the World has thrown a very large spanner into the works of something that was clanking ominously already. Read More Brexit vote not legally binding, says judge - so will the UK remain in Europe? \nOnce we leave the EU we need to find pastures new, trade deal wise, and the US was seen as the vale of plenty somewhere over the rainbow. \nHowever Trump snubbed the UK big style - Theresa May was the 11th leader he spoke to after his victory (and only after reversing the charges) - no doubt because of Tory criticism of him last year when it looked like he had no hope of winning the US presidential race.
