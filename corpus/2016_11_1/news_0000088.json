Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nLabour is “fighting fit” and ready to take on the Tories in a snap general election, a North East Shadow Cabinet member says. \nIan Lavery , MP for Wansbeck and a member of Jeremy Corbyn’s front bench team, issued the warning to Prime Minister Theresa May. \nHe spoke after Labour’s ruling body, the party’s National Executive Committee, met to discuss election strategy. \nJon Trickett, a senior figure in the shadow cabinet, said staff were on an election footing and laid out the party’s plans to move to bigger offices. \nThere is speculation that Prime Minister Theresa May could call an election if she struggles to win support from her own MPs for the Government’s Brexit strategy. \nMr Lavery said: “The situation is that volatile that there is every possibility a snap election cold be caled. \n“Things are changing almost daily, and the Prime Minister could decide her best hope is to go to the polls. \n“As far as the Labour Party is concerned, we believe there is a prospect of a snap election probably in early spring next year. \n“We have geared up. We have got people in position. We have got the campaign up and ready for any eventuality.” Read More \nHe added: “We’re ready to fight what promises to be an important battle. \n“We have got the finances in place and we are on the front foot.” \nLabour is reported to have commissioned the polling company BMG and branding agency Krow Communications, which worked with Team GB athletes, ready for a snap poll. \nAnd the party is to hire more campaign staff and move into bigger offices thanks to funding from the summer leadership election, when thousands of people paid £25 to become registered members, allowing them to vote for party leader Jeremy Corbyn or challenger Owen Smith.
