Although Mr Ashley holds a majority stake in the business, shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange. \nHe said: “To force private companies to abide by the corporate governance code will do little unless that code is tightened. \n“BHS may have been a private company, but Sports Direct isn’t, and we all know what has gone on there.” \nEarlier this year, an inquiry by MPs condemned “appalling working practices” at Sports Direct, including the use of agency staff on temporary contracts, so that the business does not need to employ them directly, and the use of zero hour contracts in Sports Direct shops, which MPs said meant staff can be “bullied, pushed around, and summarily sacked with no explanation.” \nMPs have also criticised former BHS owner Sir Philip Green, The Commons Business, Innovation and Skills Committee said he sold the retial chain to someone who knew was a “wholly unsuitable purchaser” before its failure, and his family “benefited significantly from BHS” but he failed “to invest sufficiently in stores or reinvent the business to beat the prevailing high street competition”. Former BHS owner Sir Philip Green \nLaunching a green paper setting out the Government’s proposals in a statement to the Commons, Business Secretary Greg Clark told MPs: “The document asks whether there are measures which could increase the connection between boards of directors of companies and their employees and customers. \n“It asks whether the establishment of advisory panels and the appointment of designated non-executive directors to take formal responsibility for articulating employee, customer and other perspectives is the right way to proceed. We are not prescribing how this should be done. It would be whatever is most appropriate for each business.” \nMr Clark said that other reforms responded to the fact that “executive pay has grown much faster over the last two decades than pay generally and at times is not in line with corporate performance”.

Chi Onwurah \nMr Clark said that the UK continued to have some of the tightest corporate governance rules in the world, and said concerns related to “a very small number of businesses which have undermined the reputation of British business generally”. \nJosh Hardie, CBI Deputy Director-General, said: “The UK’s approach to corporate governance is respected around the world. British firms know that great relationships with staff, customers and communities is the cornerstone of success. \n“However, businesses agree that legitimate concerns exist and are determined that the unacceptable behaviour of the few should not tarnish the effectiveness of the many. \n“So it is right that approaches to governance continue to evolve to support a modern, fair economy. \n“We look forward to working with Government to finding solutions that enhance the UK’s governance framework.” \nNewcastle Central Labour MP Chi Onwurah said: “The Government’s consultation on corporate governance is a half hearted, disappointing affair which will not support best business practice, fit businesses for the future or put workers on the boards. \n“Having alienated business with the absence of any Brexit plan, Mrs May does not feel able to challenge them to deliver what the British people want to see on pay, diversity or worker representation. This is a weak, failing Government.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-11-30T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-11-30T07:14:53.174+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
