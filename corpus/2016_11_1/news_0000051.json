affects my constituency. \nAs many of you will know, I have been against the HS2 project since the outset believing it to be a white elephant and a bad use of public money. \nThe original route that was proposed three years ago would have seen HS2 go through the Plastic Omnium factory in Measham, through the proposed Measham Wharf development then onto the M42 meaning it would have to be realigned and rebuilt and further north under East Midlands Airport through a tunnel. \nThis would have resulted in the loss of over 500 jobs at the factory, the loss of a significant regeneration project in Measham and any chance of restoring the Ashby canal, months if not years of disruption on the M42 as it was rebuilt and a possible half billion bill by tunnelling under the airport. \nRead

constituency to look of the implications of the route and try to arrive at a better solution for my constituency and the taxpayer. \nThe route published this week now includes all of my suggested alterations and moves east of Measham meaning the Plastic Omnium factory will not have to relocate saving hundreds of jobs, the Measham Wharf development can now go ahead, the M42 will remain as it is and the line will not have to tunnel under the airport. \nCost and compensation savings I believe will save the country around Â£800 million compared to the original proposals. \nI do however recognise that the route will now impact on other constituents and my pledge to them is to continue to vote against the project going ahead at all, and if it does to fight for swift and generous compensation for those affected. \nRead more: 'Don't make me vote to take away my Italian parents' rights': Alberto Costa MP's Brexit plea to PM \nI myself was forced to sell my property which was on the route of HS2 for more than 10 per cent less than I paid for it so I am anxious that my constituents get a much better deal. \nContrary to some rumours, the factory where my family business is based was unaffected by the original route. \nIn conclusion, I remain opposed to the scheme as it offers little benefit to Leicestershire, especially with a station at Toton rather than East Midlands Parkway which would be a far more sensible location. \n\"I believe if it does go ahead, the new route will be better overall for the district but I do recognise that it does now affect a new set of properties and it is my pledge to fight for your swift and fair compensation.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-11-18T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-11-18T09:48:04.362+02:00",
