X \nCopy link to paste in your message / \nA punter who had the foresight to back a Donald Trump, Brexit and Leicester City treble would be set for a huge windfall today. \nWe asked national betting comparison site Oddschecker how much the unlikely treble would have been worth. \nIf a plucky punter had put just £5 on the bet – they would be set for well over £1.5 million. \nRoss Whent from Oddschecker said: \"Following Donald Trump's win in the US election , there's been a lot of talk this morning about the value of a treble including Trump, Brexit and Leicester to win the Premier League . \n\"Trump's win has continued the trend of shock results in 2016 but what was the true best-priced value of the treble when all markets were live? \nRead more: What is the biggest shock of 2016 – Donald Trump, Brexit or Leicester City? \n\"In September 2015, the Premier League had just started, the EU referendum campaigns had just begun and the Republican and Democratic nominee campaigns were just getting off the ground. \n\"Leicester had started the season in good form but no one really gave them a chance, with best odds of 5000/1. Leaving the EU seemed highly unlikely in a two horse race, with best odds of 4/1. Trump's campaign had started to build momentum having been 250/1 a year earlier and his best odds were 12/1. \n\"Putting those three outcomes in a live accumulator would have paid a massive 325,065/1 . \n\"They say hindsight is 20/20 vision but there will be plenty of people out there wishing they had put some money on this longest of long-shots now.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-11-09T19:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-11-09T14:28:20.869+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
