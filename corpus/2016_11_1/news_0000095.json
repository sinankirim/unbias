Previously, investors were exposed to the bank providing the structured product, so if the bank went bust, all the investor's money could be lost. \nMattioli Woods' new fund will also be continuously available, in contrast to other structured products which can only be bought during a specified sales period. \nRead more: Mattioli Woods boss says UK economy is robust enough for Brexit to happen \nThe publicly quoted company said the new fund offers \"immediate access to a diversified portfolio of structured products\" adding that in the past, the same portfolio would have taken more than a year to put together. \nChief executive Ian Mattioli, said: \"It is a major step forward for us in achieving a better solution at a cheaper cost for our clients, which in turn improves the prospective return. \n\"The fund reduces costs by charging less than individual plans have done historically. We believe cost savings to clients will be significant.\" \nThe new fund will be rolled out on November 28, in association with Commerzbank, after being recognised by the UK's financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-11-16T23:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-11-16T20:26:00.708+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
