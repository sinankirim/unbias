Morrisons has jacked up the price of Marmite by 12.5% (Photo: Chris Radburn/PA Wire) \nMorrisons increased the price of Marmite by 12.5% after witnessing Unilever’s fallout with Tesco. \nWayne Hudson, managing director of Birds Eye in the UK and Ireland, told Wales Online: “Many of our raw materials are priced in dollars, and the fall in the value of the pound since the EU referendum has meant that our costs in sterling have risen. Our first priority is always to the people who buy our brands, and we are working to absorb these costs as much as possible.” Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-11-07T18:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-11-07T13:59:20.428+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
