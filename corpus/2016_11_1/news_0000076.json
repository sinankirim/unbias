Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nNissan chief executive Carlos Ghosn said he is not concerned over EU Commission plans to examine the so-called “sweetheart deal” between the car giant and the Government. \nThe motor giant delivered a surprise double boost to the region last month when it confirmed not only that it would build the next-generation Qashqai at Sunderland but also its new X-Trail SUV, a move which will potentially create up to 1,000 jobs at the plant. \nThe announcement followed talks in London between Mr Ghosn, head of the Nissan-Renault auto alliance, and Government Ministers. \nBusiness secretary minister Greg Clark confirmed the Government made several assurances to Nissan before the announcement – but refused to publish a letter he sent to the firm containing assurances as to the Government’s intentions with regard to Brexit , citing sensitive commercial details within the letter. \nOfficials in Brussels have made contact with the UK to find out what promises Mr Clark made, but Mr Ghosn said he is not worried that the investment deal will undergo EU scrutiny . \n“As a company, I’m not concerned. Obviously the concern may be with other people but for us, we make decisions, we assume our decisions, we know exactly what we want, and that’s it,” he said at an annual web summit in Lisbon. \nHe said that “nobody knows” how Brexit will pan out eventually, but that he has “every confidence” in the future competitiveness of the firm’s Wearside manufacturing plant. \n“So there’s going to be a negotiation, we’ll see what are the measures,” he said. \n“So we have plenty of time in front of us. But we had to make a decision because we have a product cycle that we have to follow and for us, there was no reason not to invest in the plant because of the quality of the discussion that we had with the British Government. \n“We made our investment decision based on our understanding that there is as much concern from our side (as) from the British government about the competitiveness of the plant no matter what happens with Brexit. \n“As long as we make commonly the same statements, we’re OK. We went ahead with our investments.” Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-11-09T20:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-11-09T16:19:32.324+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
