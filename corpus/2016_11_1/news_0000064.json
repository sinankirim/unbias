Now it’s time for the Government to keep its promise and guarantee that this money will be matched until 2020. \n“At the Autumn Statement on Wednesday, I am calling on the Chancellor to stand up for the North East and protect jobs and services in our communities. \n“There is a mandate for Brexit, but not a Brexit that would leave our communities worse off.” Read More North East business group says Chancellor must replace EU funding for the region \nPressure is building on Tory MP Phillip Hammond ahead of his first Autumn Statement. \nThe Chancellor is believed to have been told by Whitehall to deliver a Budget that boosts people who are “just about managing”. \nIn his conference speech given last month Mr Hammond offered some certainty to British businesses and organisations bidding for EU funding. \nHe said: “I’ve already guaranteed the funding for projects signed prior to this year’s Autumn Statement. Today, I can go further. The Treasury will offer a guarantee to bidders whose projects meet UK priorities and value for money criteria that if they secure multi-year EU funding before we exit we will guarantee those payments after Britain has left the EU.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-11-21T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-11-21T08:08:30.573+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
