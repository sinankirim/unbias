I have backed Paul from the very start. \n\"He is a strong supporter of local government. \n\"We have seen him here in Leicestershire for a number of events and he will I hope be back during the county council election campaign. \nMr Nuttall, who has been MEP for North West England since 2009 and has served as UKIP's chairman and deputy leader, took 62.6 per cent of the vote in the UKIP leadership contest and now takes the helm from Nigel Farage. \nMr Nuttall promised to unite UKIP and \"hold the Government's feet to the fire\" over the delivery of Brexit. \nHe said: \"The country needs a strong UKIP more now than ever before, for if UKIP ceases to be an electoral force, there will be no impetus on Theresa May and her Government to give us real Brexit and we will end up with some mealy-mouthed, backsliding version. \n\"This will be a betrayal of the British people and a united UKIP under my leadership will never, ever allow that to happen.\" \nFormer Tory Coun Sprason is one of only two UKIP members at County Hall but he said he hoped the party could take 'five or six' seats in May. \nHe said: \"We will be realistic and it will depend on where Theresa May takes us with Brexit but there are some vulnerable Tories in places where we did well in the referendum. \n\"And there are some Labour seats we could get especially as Jeremy Corbyn's not doing them any favours at the moment.\" \nThe Conservatives hold the authority with 30 councillors to the Lib Dems 13 and Labour's nine. There is one independent member. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-11-29T00:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-11-28T19:52:36.153+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
