The clock may be ticking on Brexit but it is ticking just at fast in our schools, colleges, universities and workplaces. \n“The UK is facing a skills emergency. Weaknesses in supporting young people into the labour market have existed for years, but the changing nature of jobs and skill needs have turned the situation critical. \n“The CBI will be campaigning for reformed careers advice in schools and to ensure every young person gets quality guidance and at least 4 interactions with working life by the age of 16, in every nation of the UK.” Read More Petition calls for nationalisation of East Coast rail after Stagecoach bailout \nMs Fairbairn said 2017 had been a “rollercoaster ride”, adding that uncertainty had taken its toll on industry, with some companies halting or postponing investment plans. \nShe noted that the recent progress with Brexit negotiations had been welcomed by the business community, but said that while the global economy had boomed, the UK economy slowed, with GDP growth dropping to 1.5% in 2017 compared with 2.3% in 2016. \nShe added: “While Brexit is the top political and economic issue of the day, it is only part of the picture. Many of the fundamental building blocks of our economy – skills, innovation, infrastructure – are firmly within our control. And the transformational challenges of our age, such as AI, digital and low carbon, amplify the need for urgent action. \n“Ensuring domestic priorities stay high on the Government’s agenda has been a key theme of our year.” \nIn response, the Department for Education said that it had introduced new measures to make sure schools were offering students the chance to explore vocational careers.
