We will now focus on getting money to businesses as soon as we possibly can.” \nSimon Hanson, Federation of Small Businesses’ development manager, added: “Getting the second round of JEREMIE funds agreed is great news for the North East. The first round of funding was the most successful programme in the country helping the regional economy to flourish. \n“The new £120m funds will help smaller firms across the region get the finance they need to help them achieve their growth ambitions. This in turn will help achieve the North East goal of creating more and better jobs across the region. \n“We look forward to working with the fund managers to make this a huge success.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-12-21T16:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-12-21T16:42:03.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
