Read More \nOverall exporters have been able to offset their rising costs due to improved sales and heightened overseas demand. Prices remained relatively stable over the period, with the majority of firms reporting no price changes. \nHowever, more reported a rise in their export prices than a decline. \nWhile sales have been strong, there is a concern that if the value of the pound once again dips it could lead to major increases in costs. The issue would not only impact the region’s exporters, but would also lead to increased costs for North East importers. \nThe report comes after two major businesses in the region both saw their profits shrink, despite adding £40m to their turnover. \nLawnmower manufacturer Husqvarna and automotive firm Gestamp both blamed their floundering bottom line figures on unpredictable exchange rates.
