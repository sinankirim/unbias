Here's a summary from the Mirror Online . EU Commission handout picture showing British Prime Minister Theresa May (left) and EU President Jean-Claude Juncker (Image: Etienne Ansotte/EU/PA Wire) Northern Ireland border \nThis is about finding an arrangement for Northern Ireland that doesn't cut it off from either the Republic - which is part of the EU - or the rest of the UK. \nThis was a key sticking point with the DUP. \nThe agreement commits to guarantee no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic - whatever happens. Read More These are your rights if you can't get into work due to the snow \nBut at the same time, Northern Ireland will get unfettered access to the internal UK market - even though the UK is leaving the EU's single market and customs union. \nThe UK wants to secure Northern Ireland's status without any special treatment through an overall EU-UK deal later in the process. \nIf that's not possible, however, Northern Ireland will get \"full alignment\" with some current EU rules it shares with the Republic. Citizens' rights \nThis is about ensuring the 3.2million EU citizens in Britain, and 1.2million Brits living in the other 27 EU nations, can stay after Brexit. Theresa May refused to give a firm promise until she had one for UK citizens. \nBritain and the EU have now agreed a reciprocal deal, so everything that applies to Britain will apply to the other 27 countries too. \nMrs May's plan to force EU citizens to apply for \"settled status\" appears to be intact - she wanted to let people apply after they've been in Britain for five years.

EU Commission handout picture showing British Prime Minister Theresa May and EU President Jean-Claude Juncker at a press conference (Image: Etienne Ansotte/EU/PA Wire) \nA \"proportionate approach\" will be taken to those who \"miss the deadline with good reason\". \nPeople who already have UK residence documents issued under EU law must have them converted to the new status free of charge - with only a security and background check. \nBenefits and healthcare arrangements will continue as they are now for people living in a country under the agreement before 29 March 2019. Divorce bill \nThis is about agreeing how much Britain should continue pay in the EU before (and after) it leaves. \n\"We've now agreed a settlement that is fair to the British taxpayer,\" said Theresa May. \"We will be able to invest more in our priorities at home, such as housing, schools and the NHS.\" Read More \nBut one thing's for sure - it won't be £350million a week. \nDowning Street said the bill would be 40 to 45billion Euros - or £35billion to £39billion. \nThere is no one figure in the document, but the \"methodology\" is now agreed. \nBritain will carry on paying in to the EU budget in 2019 and 2020 \"as if it had remained in the EU\", even though it leaves in March 2019.
