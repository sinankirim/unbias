Lord Shipley \nHe asked Ministers: “Do the Government accept ​that there would be little point in Transport for the North doing a lot of work and raising expectations if the Government do not meet the financial consequences of that work?” \nLord Beith, the former Lib Dem MP for Berwick, said it was important Transport for the North improved transport infrastructure in “the North of the North, not simply of the Hull-Manchester-Leeds-Liverpool corridor, important though that also is”.

That would have a very adverse effect, certainly on Newcastle Airport and, I suspect, on other airports across the northern region.

I would hope that, in the interests of the whole of the north, they would be able to follow that decision and apply it to the north of England.” \nLord Beecham added: “I am sure that Transport for the North will have views about that, and I hope the Minister and her colleagues will take note of them, should the situation arise.” \nTransport Minister Baroness Sugg said: “The aim is to improve transport to, from and within the North, boosting economic growth and rebalancing the economy. That is why we have set up Transport for the North, so the region can exercise real power and make its voice heard on how we can best invest in transport.
