Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nEmployers in the North East are bucking a gloomy national trend and forecasting job creation in the New Year, a new survey suggests. \nThe poll by recruitment group Manpower asked whether more than 2,000 employers intend to hire additional workers or reduce the size of their workforce in the coming quarter. \nThe regular survey has pegged employer confidence in the North East at its highest level since the start of the year, with the surge in companies in this region looking to recruit new staff coming at the same time that job creation has fallen to a five-year low at a national level. \nManpower’s report found that pessimism was particularly acute in London, a state of mind blamed on the capital’s expected prospects after the UK leaves the European Union . \nBut the North East was one of the region’s with a more positive outlook. \nAmanda White, head of specialist markets for Manpower, said: “The North East is proving to be a green shoot of optimism against the downbeat national outlook for employment intentions, with the region reporting a four point increase in its \nManpower Employment Outlook Survey score. \n“Few employers are talking about or planning for Brexit yet, perhaps because we have seen little impact on the number of EU workers in the region. In Newcastle there is a need for more employees in the public sector, particularly in education and the NHS. \n“The other side of this upbeat hiring intentions picture is a mismatch between the roles and the number of candidates that are suitably skilled to fill them, particularly in niche technical roles such as moulding. This means employees with the right skills hold all the power and appear confident to move between employers to secure the best deal.
