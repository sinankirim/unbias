He has said voters will be able to force changes to an EU withdrawal deal at the next election if they do not like it. British Prime Minister Theresa May, right, and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker (Image: AP) \nWriting in the Daily Telegraph, in a column said to have been given the OK by No 10, Gove said: “The British people will be in control. If the British people dislike the agreement that we have negotiated with the EU, the agreement will allow a future government to diverge.” \nHe said that after a transition period, the UK would have “full freedom to diverge from EU law on the single market and customs union”. \nHow far will this vote to diverge go? Could those who want to ‘converge’ have their say. Could it mean a second referendum? Bearing in mind the public, as much as the politicians, have learned over the last 18 months what being in the EU actually means - both good and bad - why not a second referendum?

Prime Minister Theresa May (Image: PA) \n‘We will take back control of our laws and bring an end to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in Britain,’ had the Brexiteers waving their pikestaff with particular fervour. \nHowever the court now has reach over Britain for another eight years after the UK leaves the EU.

The agreement reached in Brussels stated: “In the absence of agreed solutions, the United Kingdom will maintain full alignment with those rules of the internal market and the customs union.” \nIn short, the UK won’t be a member of the single market, have any power to shape its laws, but it will have to abide by those laws, for a very long time, maybe forever. \nFor this, May has agreed the British people will pay £39bn, money that could have been better spent elsewhere.
