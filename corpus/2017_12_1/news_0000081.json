Thank you to everyone who voted for me and thank you to everyone involved in the campaign. \n“I’m still in disbelief. I thought it was going to be really close- I even gave someone a lift up at 9.30pm because I told them it was going to be tight and every vote counts. Thank you for believing in me and I hope I will do you and Torrington proud. \n“I am proud to represent Torrington and I am proud to be a Liberal Democrat. I will stand up for what I believe in and work hard to get the best for Great Torrington.” \nCheryl travelled up to Westminster at the end of October to speak about the future for farmers post-Brexit with the Conservative MP for Torridge and West Devon, Geoffrey Cox.

As I left, I told him ‘don’t forget that’, and he assured me that he wouldn’t.” Read More ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-12-01T17:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-12-01T17:19:57.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
