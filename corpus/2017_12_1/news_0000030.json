(Image: James Saligari) \nHere's Stanley’s story and how he ended up in the jungle: \nStanley has strong Westcountry roots - He was born in Penzance and now lives on Exmoor in the village of Winsford. \nHe was previously odds-on to win I'm a Celebrity - William Hill offered 11/4 for Stanley to beat fellow South West celeb Georgia Toffolo on November 22. Read More Georgia Toffolo ‘will make a million’ through lingerie and fashion deals after leaving the Jungle \nHe had to do the first Bushtucker Trial - “My hand is totally recovered. I got a couple of pecks from a lobster I should have thought, or a prawn, or maybe a squid. By the way, did you know squids have very nasty beaks?” he said after plunging his arm into a box of live seafood. \nHe’s true blue politically - He was a Conservative MEP from 1979 to 1984 and stood for Teignbridge in the 2005 General Election. He later admitted that spelling Teignbridge without a “d” in his campaign leaflets and calling for “more talk and less action” (oops) didn’t help. He lost to the Lib Dems. \nHe was the first into the jungle shower - Viewers were treated to the sight of Stanley stripping to his pants for the I’m a Celebrity rainfall shower, made famous by Myleene Klass in a white bikini. \nStanley has no idea who most of the other celebs are in the jungle - Rebekah Vardy told him: “I’m the wife of Jamie Vardy. He plays for England.” To which Stanley replied “Now is he going to be out for the Ashes? ‘Cause the first match is next week.” He didn’t even seem to recognise Ant and Dec. \nUnlike his son Boris, he voted Remain in the Brexit referendum - But just recently he has changed his mind: “Looking back, say, 50 years from now, from the UK’s (and even the EU’s?) perspective Brexit may indeed seem to have been the right move at the right time.” \nHe comes from a very posh family - He’s a direct descendent of Karolina von Rothenburg who was the illegitimate daughter of Prince Paul of Wurttemburg, so he is related to the British Royal family, the monarchies of Sweden and Holland and the Russian Royal family, the Romanoffs.

We were told strictly not to tell anybody. I haven’t told anyone and I stick by the rules, I can tell you. I very much doubt he will ever hear about it. Don’t tell me he’s going to hear about it, it’s very unlikely. Knowing Boris he may never find out.” \nThis isn’t his first adventure - As a student in the 1960s he travelled by motorbike and sidecar from Oxford to Venice and on to India and Afghanistan. \nHe has six children and they all went to Oxford or Cambridge - With his first wife, Charlotte, he had Boris, Rachel, Jo and Leo. He later married again and had Julia and Maximilian. “What do you expect if you send your kids to Eton and St Paul's? I assumed that's where they would go... If they can’t come top, who can?” Read More When is the I'm a Celebrity live final 2017? And why Toff looks set to be crowned the Queen of the Jungle \nHis kids have done pretty well - Boris is Foreign Secretary, Rachel is a journalist and novelist, Jo is a government minister and Leo is an environmentalist. Julia is a musician and Maximilian works in Asian finance. \nThe environment is his passion - He is a trustee of the Gorilla Organisation. In 1983 he received the RSPCA Richard Martin Award for Outstanding Services to animal welfare, and in 1984 he received the Greenpeace Award for Outstanding Services to the Environment.

All you need to know about the Made in Chelsea and I'm A Celebrity star \nHe’s written 30 books about everything from poetry to Antarctica - His latest, Kompromat, is a thriller about Russian involvement in the EU referendum. \nHe has never seen I’m a Celebrity - “I have never watched the show. It’s all totally new to me, I know absolutely nothing about it but I’ve been told about it and obviously I am ready to give it a go. I don’t think I am dreading anything. I am looking forward to being with the fellow competitors, contestants. I say that because it is a competition isn’t it?” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-12-07T00:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-12-07T00:25:42.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
