David Gauke Work and Pensions Secretary (Image: Daily Mirror) \nMr Gauke told MPs: “In line with the motion before this House, I will provide, by the time the House rises for the Christmas recess, the reports directly to the Work and Pensions select committee.” \nHe said he would consider redacting certain information, such as that which is commercially sensitive, while the documents were being handed over in exceptional circumstances and did not set a precedent. \n“Against this background, I provide the reports to the select committee on a confidential basis, and in these circumstances hope and expect that documents will not be disclosed further,” he added. \nSpeaking afterwards, Labour Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Debbie Abrahams said the reports “should give greater insight into the scale of their implementation and design failures during the mismanagement of the programme”.
