An Arsenal supporter, Mr Vizard is a stalwart member of the local Labour Party who has been pounding the pavements of his prospective ward and having ‘excellent conversations’ with residents.

Alison has been busy canvassing the area and with Brexit high on the agenda will hope to improve on the 172 and 104 votes her party's candidates received at the 2016 poll. Alison has three young children, several rescue animals including three ex battery hens and a very understanding husband. She says she is passionate about helping the most vulnerable in society and keen to listen and get active in the ward. Alison Sheridan, UKIP's candidate \nRepresenting the Green Party is Tom Milburn. He has lived in the city centre for 20 years, having first come to Exeter as a student. He is highly critical of the proliferation of luxury student flats in Exeter and of the £5million spent on developing the bus station site. Tom Milburn \nLib Dem stalwart Vanessa Newcombe will be attempting to wrest the seat from Labour for her party but faces an uphill battle, Lib Dem James Landymore netted just 244 votes in the 2016 poll, while Spackman, who now faces an allegation of downloading child porn, received 1,448 votes.
