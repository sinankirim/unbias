Not everyone, as in any other walk of life, plans very far ahead. \nPersonally, this year I’ve continued my turkey tour of the constituency’s many excellent butchers, but the calendar means it’s not been possible to visit the sorting offices or go out harvesting sprouts. \nMuch as I’ve previously enjoyed thanking all those for whom Christmas is particularly hectic, from farm workers to post men and women, it’s also a timely reminder that, while it is of course a privilege to work in it, Westminster sometimes operates on its own strange timetable, accentuating the so-called ‘bubble’. \nGetting out of it, even to do Christmas shopping, is a welcome release. \nSo coming home to Lincolnshire will be a huge relief: the end of the year that has seen an election also sees the end of this phase of Brexit legislation as we look optimistically to the next one. \nYet another reason to wish one and all a Merry Christmas! \nMatt Warman is MP for Boston and Skegness Follow Us On", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-12-25T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-12-25T14:35:51.123+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
