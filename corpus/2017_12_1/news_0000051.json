Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nPrime Minister Theresa May has blasted a Devon MP whose team sent out a leaflet promising that Labour would cancel student debt. Plymouth MP Luke Pollard has apologised after sending out the leaflet. \nMr Pollard says the information was sent out by 'over-enthusiastic volunteers' on his behalf. \nHe says he did not see the leaflets before they were printed, but would take the blame nonetheless. \nThe MP confirmed Labour's policy is that they want to scrap tuition fees, rather than existing debt, the Plymouth Herald reports. \nMr Pollard said: “I’m quite disappointed about what happened and for those folks that have been effected by it – I want to say sorry, we should have done better on this one. \n“Now I’ve spoken to all the volunteers involved in making leaflets. It’s a leaflet that I hadn’t seen before it went out.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn with Sutton and Devonport MP Luke Pollard \nPrime Minister Theresa May waving one copy around in the House of Commons during Prime Minister's Question Time on Wednesday, declaring it was evidence of Labour making promises they could not keep. \nThe Prime Minister said: “Week in, week out, the right honourable gentleman comes to this house making promises he knows he cannot deliver, and Labour Members keep doing it. \n“At the election, he told students that they would write off their student debt, and then he said, 'I did not commit to write off the debt'. But what is the Labour party doing? \n“It is putting around leaflets that say 'Labour will cancel existing student debt'. \n\"It is time he apologised for the grossly misleading Labour leaflets.” \nGary Streeter, Conservative MP for South West Devon, tweeted: “I am sure that @LukePollard will recall all of these leaflets and issue one telling the truth. It is a serious matter to mislead young voters.” \nThe official leaflet was delivered to its recipients on November 30 - Plymouth University student, Jake Thurman claimed on Twitter that he had sent it to the Prime Minister. \nDuring a 30-minute Facebook Live hosted by Luke for Plymouth residents to ask him various questions, he addressed the situation and apologised. \nHe said: “Some of you will have seen today at Prime Ministers question time that the Prime Minister being unable to answer any questions on Brexit decided to attack Jeremy Corbyn on student debt which is something that the Tories like going on about. \n“In that she used a prop which was a Labour party leaflet. That leaflet came from Drake ward in the constituency that I represent and she used that as evidence that Labour were not being or saying things that were not party policy. \n“Tuition fees are helping students graduate with £50,000 worth of debt, it’s simply unacceptable that, that level of debt is occurred for gaining skills that people needs, that Britain needs people to have in the 21 Century.
