They are proposing a ‘leap into the dark’ which will have a real impact on families and individuals across Northumberland.” \nBut Mrs Trevelyan believes Britain’s farms would thrive outside of the EU. \nShe said: “The system does not work for our farmers. \n“We can create a better one designed with them in mind, and stop sending our money to French farmers at the expense of our own.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-05-28T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-05-28T17:46:39.248+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
