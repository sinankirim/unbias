\n“With exactly one month to go to the referendum, the British people must ask themselves this question: can we knowingly vote for a recession?” \nRonnie Campbell has accused the Chancellor of making 'wild predictions' \nPainting a gloomy picture of the effects of leaving, the Chancellor claimed in a speech that it would lead to the economy shrinking, the value of the pound falling, inflation rising, wages falling, house prices falling government borrowing going up. \nGuy Opperman , the Conservative MP for Hexham in Northumberland and a supporter of the “remain” campaign, echoed the warning, saying: “Times are hard - why would you want to damage our North East economy? There is no doubt that Brexit would make the North East worse off.” \nAnd Jayne Anne Gadhia, chief executive of Newcastle-based banking giant Virgin Money , added: “Staying in the EU means economic security for local people and families. With around 100,000 jobs in the region linked to exports to the EU, voting to leave comes with a hefty price tag - for workers, businesses and consumers.” \nBut Anne-Marie Trevelyan, Conservative MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed , said leaving the EU would make it easier for North East firms to trade with growing markets in other parts of the world. \nShe said: “Only 6% of our businesses export to the EU, but 100% of them have to abide by the EU’s crippling regulations which damage our small and medium-sized businesses. \n“By contrast, the UK operates a trade deficit with the EU – we are the EU’s largest export market. EU countries will need to continue to sell us their products after we vote to leave the EU. The real risk to growth and jobs is if we vote to stay.” \nShe added: “The Eurozone suffers from crippling unemployment and stagnant growth. The risk to jobs is to remain in a failing political union and risk our economy by bailing out Eurozone countries. \n“The two most successful nations in Europe are Norway and Switzerland – they have the highest GDP, the lowest unemployment and the lowest wage inequality. Neither are members of the EU.” \nRonnie Campbell, the Labour MP for Blyth Valley, accused the Chancellor of making “wild predictions”. \nHe said the job loss claims were based on the assumption that the EU would refuse to trade with the UK or introduce restrictions. \nBut he said: “Are French farmers going to say you can’t have our food? Or carmakers in Germany saying you can’t buy our Mercedes? \n“We are the fifth biggest economy in the world. Capitalists are not going to do that.” \nBut Mr Campbell, who will voting to leave the EU in the referendum on June 23, said both sides in the debate had resorted to scare tactics. \nHe said: “It is about frightening the voters either to stay in or come out.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-05-23T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-05-23T20:47:53.671+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
