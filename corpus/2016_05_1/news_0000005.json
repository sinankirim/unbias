Turnover, meanwhile, rose from £44m in 2014 to £56.7m the following year. \nThe company has also appeared in the Deloitte Technology Fast 500 EMEA for three years running and the UK Technology Fast 50 for the past two years. \nDuring her time there, Mrs Baldwin witnessed a demonstration of its impulseSave technology and its planning dashboard True Potential One, which gives savers a full overview of their investments. \nShe also discussed the Lifetime ISA (Lisa), which from next April will mean savers will be able to receive a 25% Government bonus for saving up to £4,000 annually. \nShe said: “I’m was very grateful to get the chance to see a growing financial services business and it’s fantastic to see so many graduates from North East universities creating financial services careers at this fast-growing company. \n“Two thirds of jobs in financial services are outside the M25 area. The sector benefits the whole of the UK and the UK is acknowledged as a world leader.” \nTrue Potential managing partner David Harrison said: “FinTech is thriving in the UK with the Government’s support and we were pleased to show the Economic Secretary our impulseSave and True Potential One technology that is helping to simplify saving and investing. \n“The Lifetime ISA is an excellent example of a simple and effective way to save and our research shows that it is certain to be popular when it is available next year.” \nTreasury Minister Harriet Baldwin visits True Potential LLP at Newburn. Also pictured David Harrison of True Potential \nAt Virgin Money, then Mrs Baldwin, alongside the company’s CEO Jayne-Anne Gadhia, addressed employees on the benefits remaining in the EU would bring to the North East’s financial services sector. \nNew Treasury analysis has shown the North East’s economy would be tipped into recession, with unemployment rising by 20,000 if Britain voted to leave the EU. \nAcross all sectors, around 100,000 jobs in the region are linked to the UK’s exports to other EU countries. \nThe region has also benefited from £1.1bn of inward investment from EU members over the last five years, with 90 foreign investment projects creating or safeguarding almost 6,000 jobs. \nMs Baldwin said: “Voters in Newcastle and across the country faces a fundamental choice – whether to remain a member of a reformed EU, or to take a leap into the dark. \n“A vote to stay in Europe will protect jobs in the North East, promote economic growth and ensure that the regional financial services sector continues to grow. \n“Let’s make the right choice on the 23rd of June. Let’s stay in.” \nMs Gadhia said: “Working with our European partners, Britain has helped create the biggest market in the world. \n“Membership of the EU gives us unrestricted access to 500m consumers and, with around 100,000 jobs in the North East linked to exports to the EU, remaining as a strong part of a reformed EU protects our jobs, our incomes and our future. \n“The benefits of EU membership significantly outweigh the costs and I believe the path to a more certain and prosperous future for our families, business, innovation and investment is to vote Remain on June 23.” The European Union debate", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-05-26T18:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-05-26T19:22:57.974+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
