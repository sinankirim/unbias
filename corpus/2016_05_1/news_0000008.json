Euro-sceptic Tory North West Leicestershire MP Andrew Bridgen. \nCoun Wyatt, who represents the Warren Hills division at County Hall, said he believed the EU was a 'bureaucratic mess'. \nHe said: \"There aren't that many of us in the party but I'm not the only one on the Lib Dem benches at County Hall who is for leaving. \n\"It hasn't been a problem. \n\"The view on this is really each to their own. \n\"I believe the purpose of the EU as been lost, and as steadily become a huge distraction, and a huge financial black hole. \n\"The EU is also becoming an overcrowded bureaucratic mess that we should no longer be apart. \n\"As a Liberal Democrat I support the open market but I cannot and will not support an ever increasing financial and social restrictive EU which ignores its citizens and becoming to large for it to be able to function the way its was meant.\" \nRead more: First Person: 'Leicester City's red away kit is more divisive than Marmite \nCoun Wyatt added: \"For many years now I have had grave misgivings about the future direction of the EU. \n\"Turkey for one is pounding at the door expecting to join, which is a step we will all regret if its allowed to happen due to its less than democratic credentials, and its unstable relationship with various sections within its own borders. \n\"Staying in or leaving the EU is going to be a major game changer for everyone, but I really do believe that leaving the current EU will bring us greater freedom, greater opportunities, and greater self belief in our ability to be able to become a nation that can stand on its own two feet and be proud.\" \nSenior Liberal Democrat Vince Cable will be attending a remain rally in Leicester on Thursday. \nThe former secretary of state for business, skills and innovation will share a stage with Labour Leicester West MP Liz Kendall and Green MP for Brighton Pavilion Caroline Lucas. \nThe Leading not Leaving event will take place at St Martin's House in Peacock Lane from 1pm to 3pm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-05-31T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-05-31T16:56:41.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
