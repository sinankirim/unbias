Need I say more? \nFor those in Britain wanting us to puff out our chests and go it alone, bear in mind our lacklustre economy and low productivity, and that the UK accounts for less than 1% of the world’s population and only 2-3% of global GDP, percentages that are going to shrink in the future. \nYou could ignore flustered G7 leaders who warned that Britain leaving the European Union would be a threat to the global economy. \nYou cannot ignore the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Britain’s most respected economics think-tank with an impeccable reputation for impartiality. They made it crystal clear: Brexit could save about £8bn annually – less than half a per cent of national income – if Britain stopped contributing to the EU but the cost and disruption of leaving the EU would bring a significant economic slowdown. \nIt took me a while to work out what it was that had bothered me at the excellent debate held at Barter Books recently. I looked back at the photos on my phone – no young people – only grey or balding heads listening to Anne-Marie Trevelyan, Conservative MP for the Berwick constituency, and Julie Pörksen, spokesperson for the Liberal Democrat party in Northumberland . \nJulie said the next generation will be more prosperous and safer if we stay in Europe. They may vote the way Cameron wants if he could offer them respite from student debt, low wages, dwindling public services and ludicrous rents. \nIn the North East, the Office for National Statistics projects that, over the next eight years, there will be a 20% increase in people over 65 while the number of 16 to 64-year-olds falls. So who will “man” the tools, tills and tillers? \nNumerous studies show immigration to Britain has not increased unemployment or reduced wages. If the UK closed its doors to more than two-thirds of prospective immigrants, skill and labour shortages would cause economic seizure. We just don’t have enough UK graduates or apprentices in science, maths or engineering. Leaving the EU could undermine thousands of British businesses, not to mention an understaffed NHS reliant on foreign nurses and doctors. \nPredictably, an audience member at Barter Books said immigrants are responsible for bankrupting the NHS. Wrong. Most immigrants are young, healthy and work hard. The key development for public services has been deepening austerity; a growing population will put pressure on services if we don’t invest in them. In 2014, the NHS had a shortfall of 50,000 clinically trained staff, gaps migrants helped fill. One in five care workers is foreign-born. The NHS is in a pickle because of the huge amount it pays agency staff, and an ageing population suffering long-term health conditions. Britain spends a lower percentage of national wealth on health than France, Germany, Sweden or even Greece. \nI am not uncritical of the EU: it promotes its own commercial interests while doing little to stimulate economic growth in the developing world; it has been slow and inflexible over Greece’s debt; it must urgently fathom how to help the refugees on our doorstep or populism and extremism will continue to gain ground. \nWe have an imperfect EU beset by mounting troubles but Brexit is a recipe for silent decline and regional chaos. \nToo often, money in the hands of the Chancellor fails to find its way North. A recent report from Northumberland County Council states that the North East has been allocated £436m of European Structural and Investment Funds for the budget period 2014-2020. That’s the largest allocation outside London. EU money allocated to our region is ours to spend. \nOf course, the EU needs to change if it is to become more effective and more accountable. \nBrexiteers point to lumbering Brussels bureaucracy and bemoan the UK’s limited influence. Gordon Brown reminded us this week that Britain will hold the presidency of the European Council between July and December 2017, handing the UK responsibility for pushing through new EU diktats and brokering co-operation between member states. A better place surely from which to puff out our chest. \nMost EU members want less red tape. One point lost in the debate is that, just as Britain considers Brexit, the European Commission has already proposed fewer regulations. According to the London School of Economics, our costliest business regulations are home-grown, not EU inspired. By international standards, Britain is lightly regulated. \nEU social policy and positive regulation over the past 45 years have made this country, and our lives, infinitely fairer and safer, and every major climate change agreement has involved EU leadership. \nA historian, Brendan Simms, boiled the whole argument down to three words, quite simply: “Europe made us.” \nAn integrated Europe is a legacy worth improving, not abandoning. \nThe journalist Martin Wolf said this referendum is, arguably, the most irresponsible act by a British government. \nWhatever the result, I hope the EU forgives us.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-05-31T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-05-31T13:41:52.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
