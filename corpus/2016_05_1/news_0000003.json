X \nCopy link to paste in your message / Comments (0) \nThe protected status of Melton Mowbray pork pies would not necessarily be lost if the UK quit the European Union, an expert has said. \nPrime minister David Cameron has written to various local newspapers arguing the special recognition of unique foods in Bitaun would be at risk if the country votes to leave the EU in next month's referendum. \nThe European Union granted the Melton Mowbray Pork Pie protected status in 2008 which meant only pies made in the area could carry the label. \nLast month, in a letter to the Gloucester Echo, the Prime Minister wrote: \"If we leave the EU and our farmers have to operate under World Trade Organisation rules, things would be very different. \n\"They could be faced with annual tariffs of up to 40 per cent and huge additional costs - for example, £240million for beef and £90 million for lamb. \n\"Protected status enjoyed across Europe by our unique products, such as Gloucestershire cider, Single Gloucester cheese and traditionally-farmed Gloucester old spot pork, will be lost.\" \nRead more: £850,000 cost scuppered popular 'Leicester Lightbulb' sculpture plan \nHowever chairman of the Melton Mowbray Pork Pie Association Matthew O'Callaghan, who is also chairman of the UK Protected Food Names Association, said the protected status could be maintained which ever way the vote goes. \nHe said: \"If there was a Brexit the protected status will remain.\"There are many foods from countries that are not in the EU that have protected status - Colombian coffee for example. \n\"But if we did leave, EU regulations would cease to apply and it would mean our Government would have to bring in new legislation.\"Given that they have been promoting it heavily I don't think it would be a problem.\" \nMr O'Callaghan, a former Labour parliamentary candidate and supporter of EU, added: \"It is an argument that has been made against Brexit but there could still be protected status.\" \nRead more: Controversial Leicestershire fire chief in unexpected departure after turbulent year in charge \nMr O'Callaghan said since the EU referendum debate began there had been considerable interest in the subject of protected food statuses. \nHe said: \"We have had Irish television here asking about it and Russian television too.\"All are asking what it means should we leave the EU.\"Things would change but the protected status could be kept.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-05-26T13:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-05-26T14:01:11.463+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
