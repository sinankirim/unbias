Elsewhere he pointed out that “We are the fifth-largest economy in the world, the biggest defence player in Europe with one of the most extensive and influential diplomatic networks on the planet.” \nOf course, he might believe that we could succeed outside the EU but that (somehow) we could do even better by being tied into the European Union. I wouldn’t agree but it would be an honest viewpoint for him to hold. His words back in February must have been true, or else he would have to resign: a Prime Minister who misleads Parliament has no other course of action. PA Wire Prime Minister David Cameron \nFast-forward to today, when he’s trying to win a referendum campaign for the ‘Remain’ side. We have veiled threats of World War 3, of recession; of terror attacks, and from his chancellor of loss of jobs, wages and house values. In British politics, sadly, the ‘crime’ of misleading the British people is considered to be far less serious than that of misleading the House of Commons. It’s not a resignation issue (and is there any wonder people have little trust in politicians when this kind of thing happens?) but it erodes the public trust in our politicians still further. He is misleading the British public, and I cannot for the life of me see how this could be anything other than intentional. In my opinion David Cameron desperately wants a Remain vote to save his own job. \nMany people in the North East don’t trust the Conservatives anyway, but is Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn really any better? He used to be anti-European Union; indeed, he voted against membership all the way back in 1975 when opposition to the European Union was a fringe political view. Throughout the decades, his various quotes on the subject have been pretty clear. Only last year, he described the situation in Greece: “If the EU becomes a totally brutal organisation that treats every one of its member states in the way that the people of Greece have been treated at the moment, then I think it will lose a lot of support from a lot of people.” \nJeremy Corbyn, leader of the Labour Party \nLabour’s Kate Hoey MP, one of the principled few who dare to face down the Labour Party machine and publicly call for the UK to leave the European Union: “We were joined on many occasions over the last 20-odd years in the lobby when we were doing our bit to oppose the various treaties and issues which were furthering EU domination of our country. Jeremy was always with us.” \nI spoke to one Labour MEP (not from the North East, and I’m not naming names because it would be unfair to do so) who didn’t believe, in their heart of hearts, that Corbyn had actually changed his mind. It could be that he is merely bowing to the will of the majority of the Parliamentary Labour Party or his perception that a majority of its activists want to remain in the EU. I interpreted it as meaning that he would like to leave the European Union, but is campaigning for Remain because he’s terrified of losing his job if he gives his own honest view. \nOur Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition have something in common. They’re both threatening us with all kinds of negative consequences if we vote to leave the European Union, but in fact they’re both acting within their own self-interest. If you think David Cameron is a fantastic Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and if you’re willing to overlook the hoodwinking of the British people, then you might well vote to Remain if you can cope with the astronomical cost, unlimited immigration and continuing drip-drip-drip of job-destroying legislation. Otherwise, a Leave vote - a vote for our independence, freedom and democracy - might well have the added byproduct of not just putting me and my MEP colleagues out of work (a badge I’d wear with pride if it meant getting our country back), but also removing an unpopular Prime Minister who’s well past his sell-by date anyway.
