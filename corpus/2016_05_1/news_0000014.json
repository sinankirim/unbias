Small businesses are the backbone of our economy. Let’s not break that backbone with a leap into the dark.” \nBritain Stronger in Europe also highlighted comments from a number of North East firms backing the Remain Campaign. \nCharlie Gibbs, director of Gateshead-based company Steampunk Gin, said: “We are a small but growing gin business who are looking to expand by exporting into countries all across Europe. At the moment, once we have established new customers, doing business is easy. \n“We don’t have to worry about import tariffs, local VAT or duty variations because all these deals have been done en-bloc through the European construct we currently have. \n“If this was to be denied to us, who knows what kind of deals our Government would be able to do with a multiplicity of countries? There is no guarantee that we could be in the same bargaining position as we are today. \n“In addition, we source round 80% of our raw materials from EU countries, which means we pay no local VAT due to the reciprocal arrangements we have now. If, for example, we had to start paying Germany 19% VAT that we could not claim back, then that 19% increase would need to be passed onto our customers, who in turn would be passing it onto consumers.” \nBut John Longworth, former director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce who now chairs the Vote Leave Business Council, said: “These Government figures are extremely questionable. \n“The reality is that only 6% of British firms export to the EU, but 100% are caught up in red tape and costs from Brussels. If we Vote Leave and take back control of our economy, our businesses will thrive.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-05-31T17:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-05-31T18:37:21.994+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
