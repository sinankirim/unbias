Chester-le-Street on Monday – with an added spin. \nThe former Mayor of London was joined by former England cricket captain Ian Botham at Chester-le-Street cricket ground, just up the road from Emirates Riverside stadium, where England are currently taking on Sri Lanka. \nThe one time Scunthorpe United centre half ‘Beefy’ Botham came out to bat for Brexit last month, slamming the European Union as “corrupt” and a “racket” in a Sunday Times article. \nMr Johnson asked the cricketer, who he called “one of the country’s great sporting heroes”, where he thought the Leave campaign stood, just weeks away from the vote. \nHe said: “I’d say we’re some wickets down, but we can win the match, we’ve got the right players and we’ve got enough votes in hand.” \nBefore stepping in to bowl and bat for a few overs with the pro-Brexit Durham students, Mr Johnson told the assembled crowd that Brexit would save the UK £350m a week. \nHe added leaving the EU was important for British democracy. \nBoris Johnson meets up with fellow vote leaver Ian Botham at Chester-le-Street Cricket Club \nBut the Tory politician refused to answer questions about the state of his own party, as the referendum campaign causes increasingly bitter divides among Conservatives. \nHe insisted that what the public wanted was for him to speak about the advantages he see for the UK outside of the EU. \nHe said: “My job in the next 23 days, whatever we have got left, is to get over our key messages. \n“This is the only chance in our lifetimes to go for a new approach, a democratic approach, but still leading in Europe.” \nAsked about the outlook for the North East outside the EU, Mr Johnson said In campaigners were wrong to suggest that manufacturing jobs, such as those at the Nissan plant in Sunderland , would be at risk. \nHe said: “If you look at what Carlos Ghosn [chairman and CEO of Nissan] himself has said, they’ve very much changed their line since 15 years ago when the discussion was held about the Euro and I think Nissan now see massive strengths in this area, a great skills base, fantastic people, no reason not to continue to invest in this part of the world, that’s what they’re saying and plenty of other international investors are saying the same thing.” \nBoris Johnson meets up with fellow vote leaver Ian Botham at Chester-le-Street Cricket Club \nAnd he also denied concerns raised by Skills Minister Nick Boles MP on a recent visit to Newcastle that the North East would lose thousands of tech jobs outside the EU. \nHe said: “Digital is one of those areas where the EU’s attempts at legislation regulation have been absolutely catastrophic and the UK’s success in that area, in tech, is nothing to do with our membership of the EU.” \nThe gathered students enjoyed their brief cricket match with the politician, and did not pass up the opportunity to take selfies and quiz him on campaigning tactics. \nEconomics student Sam Taylor, 21, said he would be voting to leave because he felt over-regulation had made Britain less competitive than it should be on the world stage. \nAsked whether it was easy to persuade students and young people to vote for an independent Britain, he said: “Everyone I’ve spoken to has been less informed, and I’ve had reasonable success in convincing them. \n“I think they’re there to be persuaded.", "external_links": [], "published":
