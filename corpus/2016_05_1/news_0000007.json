There are special challenges we have to face and I believe these challenges can be met by working together as one community.” \nThe letter reads: “Faith is about integration and building bridges, not about isolation and erecting barriers. \n“As leaders and senior figures of faith communities, we urge our co-religionists and others to think about the implications of a leave vote for the things about which we are most passionate. \n“The past 70 years have been the longest period of peace in Europe’s history. Institutions that enable us to work together and understand both our differences and what we share in common contribute to our increased security and sense of collective endeavour. \n“What’s more, so many of the challenges we face today can only be addressed in a European, and indeed a global, context: combatting poverty in the developing world, confronting climate change and providing the stability that is essential to tackling the current migration crisis. \n“We hope that when voting on June 23, people will reflect on whether undermining the international institutions charged with delivering these goals could conceivably contribute to a fairer, cleaner and safer world.” \nOther figures to have signed the letter include Rt Rev and Rt Hon Dr Rowan Williams, former Archbishop of Canterbury; Rabbi Laura Janner-Klausner, Principal Rabbi, Movement for Reform Judaism; Mona Siddiqui, professor of Islamic and Inter-Religious Studies and assistant principal of religion and society, University of Edinburgh; and Bharti Tailor, executive director, Hindu Forum in Europe. \nThe letter comes as former Conservative Defence Secretary Liam Fox said it would only be possible to reduce immigration to tens of thousands if the UK votes to leave the EU. \nBrexit advocate Dr Fox was asked about one of the biggest issues featuring in the referendum debate on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. \nDr Fox said immigration is a “huge issue for real people” who are facing the implications of it in their “real lives” and that he does not have a problem with migration, but “uncontrolled migration”. \nThe North Somerset MP said: “No Conservative MP who was elected at the last election can fulfil our pledge to the British people - including me - if we stay in the European Union. \n“I am quite sure that the Prime Minister wanted to be able to get restrictions on free movement to be able to meet that target but it wasn’t on offer. \n“There is no reformed EU, it is a fantasy.” \nOn Monday, Boris Johnson will arrive in the region on the Vote Leave battle bus. Mr Johnson will meet students from Durham University and then travel to the Riverside at Chester-le-Street to meet up with ex-England cricketer Sir Ian Botham.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-05-29T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-05-29T22:09:41.470+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
