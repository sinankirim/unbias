X \nCopy link to paste in your message / Comments (1) \nLiz Kendall has hit out at Government plans to sell off the Land Registry. \nThe Labour Leicester West MP has urged ministers to abandon proposals to privatise the department following a consultation which ended today. \nThe registry holds documents detailing property. \nSome 250 Land Registry employees work at its office in Westbridge Place in her constituency and the potential privatisation has left their futures uncertain. \nMs Kendall said the latest attempt to sell the Land Registry was a rehash of plans she had fought in the last Parliament. \nShe said: \"Previous reviews by the Tories themselves found the fact the Land Registry is in public ownership is crucial to its impartiality and its work. \n\"It hold the records of ownership of £2.5 trillion worth of property across the country. \n\"It is trusted and it must remain in public hands. I will keep campaigning to try to prevent it being privatised.\" \nThe Government has argued a sell-off will produce cash which will go towards the repayment of the national debt. \nIt has not put a price tag on the registry, but previous valuations have returned a figure of £1.2 billion. \nLast year, the department made a surplus of £36.6m and paid the Government more than £100 million in dividends. \nSome 288,000 people have signed an online petition against the proposed sell-off. \nRead more: Brexit would not cost Melton Mowbray Pork Pies protected status says pro-EU expert \nPCS union general secretary Mark Serwotka said: \"We exposed the emptiness of the Government's case last time and will do again to put a stop to this plan that is being driven by short-term political choice, not economic necessity. \n\"Home buyers and owners rely on the Land Registry to provide an impartial professional service and it must remain under public control, free from any profit motive and conflict of interest.\" \nA Government spokesman said: \"We believe our preferred model would benefit Land Registry, the Government, customers and the wider public. \n\"It would bring significant benefits to Land Registry and, in time, the wider economy by increasing the potential of the business and its data. \n\"We believe a transaction of this type is deliverable in 2017, thereby reducing impact of delay and uncertainty to the workforce.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-05-26T21:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-05-26T22:33:31.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
