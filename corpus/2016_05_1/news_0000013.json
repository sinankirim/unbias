It's not just London that benefits from banks, Harriet Baldwin will say, as she visits Virgin Money and True Potential on Thursday Shares Get daily news by email Economic Secretary to the Treasury Harriett Baldwin and Atom Bank chairman Anthony Thomson \nLeaving the European Union would severely damage the competitiveness of the North East’s financial services industry, a Treasury Minister has warned, \nSpeaking ahead of a visit to Newcastle, Harriett Baldwin, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, said it wasn’t just London that would suffer if Britain’s banking sector was damaged by quitting the EU. \nShe said financial services played a key role in the North East, adding around £2bn to the region’s economy every year. \nThe industry supports around 53,000 jobs in the region, with 26,000 people working directly in financial services and another 27,000 working in associated professional services. \nBut this would be put at risk by a vote to leave the EU in the referendum on June 23, she said. \nMrs Baldwin is due to visit the Gosforth offices of Virgin Money on Thursday, where she will speak to staff about the benefits of remaining in the EU. \nThe Minister will also visit True Potential, another major financial services employer in the city. \nAlan Johnson MP \nOn Wednesday, Alan Johnson MP, chair of the Labour In for Britain campaign visited the Hitachi Rail Europe site in Newton Aycliffe with the ‘Labour In’ battle bus. \nHis fellow Labour In peer, Hilary Benn, will be at the Angel of the North and the Oxford Centre in Longbenton on Thursday, while Nigel Farage will be in Newcastle city centre on the ‘leave’ campaign trail. \nMrs Baldwin said: “The financial services industry in the North East makes an important contribution to the Northern Powerhouse. \n“Today I am visiting True Potential and Virgin Money, two firms that make are going from strength to strength in Newcastle. They play an important role in the local economy and are part of a financial services industry that employs around 26,000 people with a further 27,000 in related professional services.” \nShe added: “Voters in Newcastle and across the country face a fundamental choice – whether to remain a member of a reformed EU, or to take a leap into the dark. \n“A vote to stay in Europe will protect jobs in the North East, promote economic growth and ensure that the regional financial services sector continues to grow.” \nNewcastle is at the heart of the North East’s financial services industry, accounting for around a quarter of all financial and associated professional services jobs in the region according to the Treasury. \nVirgin Money employs around 2,000 people in the city, and other major employers include AA insurance, Tesco Bank, Santander and the Newcastle Building Society. Another bank, Atom Bank, is based in Durham. 2016 Getty Images The European Union and the Union flag sit together \nAccess to the EU single market helped the UK financial services sector to export over £22bn in 2014, the Treasury says. \nJayne-Anne Gadhia, Virgin Money’s chief executive, said: “Working with our European partners, Britain has helped create the biggest market in the world. \n“Membership of the EU gives us unrestricted access to 500 million consumers and, with around 100,000 jobs in the North East linked to exports to the EU, remaining as a strong part of a reformed EU protects our jobs, our incomes and our future.” \nThe latest warning comes after the Treasury published a report earlier this week predicting the economy would be tipped into recession and unemployment in the North East could rise by 20,000 if Britain voted to leave the EU. \nThe EU referendum campaign has become increasingly bad-tempered with senior Conservatives battling each other - and complaining that the Government is giving itself an unfair advantage. Poll loading … \nFormer Tory mayor of London, Boris Johnson, and 27 other MPs who have written to Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood demanding the Government delete pages from its official website which back a ‘remain’ vote. \nThey say the pages must go once the so-called purdah period comes into force on May 27. \nAnd Chancellor George Osborne has been accused trying to “muzzle” pro-Brexit Conservative MPs. \nTory backbencher Anne Main told the House of Commons: “They are trying to muzzle us when we are trying to get the truth of all this.” \nBut there was a boost for the ‘leave’ campaign as former military chiefs warned that the UK will be forced into a European army if we stay in the EU. \nLaunching the Veterans For Britain campaign, Major General Tim Cross said: “The Prime Minister and others who constantly tell me to be afraid, frankly, speaking soldierly about it, they can bugger off.” The European Union debate", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-05-26T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-05-26T08:02:46.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
