We have commissioned independent economists to do an assessment of the consequences of us leaving the EU based on a number of different scenarios. \n“The bad news for the North East is I’m afraid you will see less jobs created, you will see some of your sectors diminishing and a huge impact on the quality of life.

What they have to negotiate for is one that is least damaging to the country’s economy and the North East economy, meaning a soft Brexit. \n“In my view, we should stay in the single market and the customs market even though we’re outside the European Union. My worry is the Prime Minister is thinking about political party interests rather than national interests.” \nMr Khan spent time in Newcastle’s West End with local Labour party members on Saturday afternoon, before speaking at the Discovery Museum’s Grand Hall at an event celebrating the 15th anniversary of immigration law firm Latif Solicitors.

He has a real affinity with the area, and there’s so many places we have visited together. \n“He loves getting his fish and chips from the coast!” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-25T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T08:14:22.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
