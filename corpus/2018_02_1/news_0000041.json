Accountable is a bit of a misnomer, I think. \nThese ACOs would reportedly allow commercial, non-NHS bodies to run health and social services. They could be awarded huge contracts to manage and provide whole packages of care, allowing the ACOs to either provide the NHS service themselves or sub-contract it. \nThis means ACOs will have control over the allocation of NHS and taxpayers’ money but their accountability for spending it and their obligations to the public will be under commercial contracts, not government statutes. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (Image: PA) \nApparently the origin of these organisations lies in the Five Year Forward View plan for NHS England published by chief executive Simon Stevens and colleagues in 2014. \nIt said: “The traditional divide between primary care, community services and hospitals - largely unaltered since the birth of the NHS - is increasingly a barrier to the personalised and co-ordinated health services patients need.” Read More Newcastle academic and Stephen Hawking to fight NHS 'privatisation' in court \nThe fact that Hunt is behind it and thinks it represents the future of the NHS is enough for alarm bells to clank very loudly. The only thing co-ordinated in the NHS these days seem to be the calls for Hunt to go. \nI’m with the campaigners who see ACOs as a form of backdoor privatisation. Some might go further and describe it as just privatisation. \nFortunately there are people out there fighting it. They include Professor Allyson Pollock, who works at Newcastle University, who is part of a campaign group which includes Prof Stephen Hawking.

Gina became the figurehead of the legal fight to get Parliament to vote on whether the UK can start the process of leaving the EU. And won of course. \nIt does seems extraordinary on two of the most complex and important issues of our time - the future of the NHS and Brexit - it has been up to members of the people to ensure the matters are properly debated in parliament despite the best efforts of the ruling government.
