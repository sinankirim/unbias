Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn has praised Newcastle MP Chi Onwurah for her work encouraging more women and girls to take up a career in engineering. \nMr Corbyn highlighted her efforts as he spoke to the EEF, the body representing manufacturers. \nThe Labour leader also set out Labour’s plans to change the economy. He said it had been dominated by finance for decades, and he wanted it to be led by what he called “the productive economy.” \nMs Onwurah, Labour MP for Newcastle Central and a Shadow Business Minister, was an engineer before becoming an MP and headed the Telecoms Technology Division at OFCOM, the UK Telecom Regulator. \nShe has campaigned to get more women involved in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, including speaking to students and writing articles. \nMr Corbyn pointed out that the EEF has a female chair, engineer Dame Judith Hackitt. \nBut he continued: “Women now make up 43 percent of GPs and about half of all solicitors, but only eight percent of professional engineers. And this has remained static under this Government, while the proportion of women working in ‘high-tech’ industries has actually declined.” Newcastle Central MP, Chi Onwurah (Image: Newcastle Chronicle) \nHe highlighted the work of Ms Onwurah and Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour’s Shadow Business Secretary, saying: “My mum was a fierce advocate for young women going into science and engineering not just a matter of social justice, but as an economic imperative because we cannot build a more prosperous economy without making use of the talents of everyone. \n“And I know both Rebecca Long-Bailey and Chi Onwurah are committed to campaigning in opposition and acting in government to ensure that women are not held back in industry.” \nMr Corbyn said governments had allowed the banking sector to do whatever it wanted in return for the tax revenues it generated, but the result had been “an economy with more risk, more volatility and more instability”. \nIn comments criticising both recent Labour governments and the Conservative government, he said: “For forty years, deregulated finance has progressively become more powerful. Its dominance over industry, obvious and destructive; its control of politics, pernicious and undemocratic.
