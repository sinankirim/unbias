Meanwhile, insurance group North is opening a base in Ireland to ensure continued access to EU markets. \nMr Thomas’s comments come as the firm posts a strong set of results for the six months ended December 31 2017, with revenues rising 9.5% to £1.988bn. \nThe firm said its strong operational and financial performance has been driven by good customer demand, resulting in good growth in pre-tax profit which was up 6.8% to £342.7m.

With this being our 60th anniversary year it is great to see our business in the North East, the founding Barratt Division, building more homes, creating new jobs and supporting economic growth right across the region.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T14:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T15:10:31.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
