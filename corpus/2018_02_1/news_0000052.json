Conservative MP for Berwick Anne-Marie Trevelyan \nLabour shadow Brexit minister Paul Blomfield said the letter showed Mrs May “is too weak to face down the fanatics in her own party and to deliver a final deal that protects jobs and the economy.” \nBut some Conservatives pointed out that despite the tough language, the letter largely called for the Government to do what it has already promised anyway. \nIt was drawn up by the European Research Group, a group of Tory Eurosceptics chaired by backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg. \nMrs Trevelyan is a member of the group. She also is a Parliamentary Private Secretary for Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, and it is unusual for someone in such a role to challenge Government policy. \nIt seems the letter was never meant to be made public, but a copy was leaked to the Times newspaper. Mrs Trevelyan was not available for comment. Prime Minister Theresa May (Image: PA) \nSome Conservative MPs criticised the letter. \nChelmsford MP Vicky Ford said: “Instead of helping the Prime Minister, it seeks to tie her hands.

Brexit Minister Steve Baker (Image: PA) \n“You can see that they want us to exit at the end of the budget period, the Prime Minister is suggesting two years. \n“But what will be the case is, when we’ve agreed, there will be a fixed date.” \nThe transition period will begin after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019.
