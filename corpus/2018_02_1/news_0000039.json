Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA high-speed rail network in the North of England must be delivered at the same time as the planned HS2 line to help close the North-South divide, a powerful group of business and political leaders will say today. \nThe Northern Powerhouse Partnership has won backing from around the region for a plan that would see train journeys from Newcastle to Birmingham reduced to just under two hours and Newcastle to London to two-and-a-quarter. Part of the proposed route for the HS2 high speed rail scheme (Image: PA) \nThe group - which was set up by former Chancellor George Osborne - says Northern Powerhouse Rail would create thousands of jobs in the North, but must be delivered at the same time as the Government’s current high speed rail plan, which will deliver huge benefits to the Midlands and the south but will not come to the North East. \nThe group’s call for a proper high speed rail service across the North comes as business and political leaders have come together in the region to push the case for improved investment in rail services outside of the capital. \nToday will also see Sunderland Central MP Julie Elliott delivering a keynote speech at a conference in Leeds to launch a campaign for better rail services to Sunderland, arguing that the full benefits of high speed rail must come to smaller cities and towns in the North as well as regional capitals.

Driving the North’s ambitions is a national priority. \n“The economic assets of Sunderland in key sectors like digital can be fully realised when fellow Northern cities like Leeds are part of the same ecosystem – genuinely collaborating, not competing.” \nBackers of Northern Powerhouse Rail say it would reduce rail journeys from Newcastle to Leeds to an hour, while journeys to cities like Bradford and Hull would also be considerably quicker.
