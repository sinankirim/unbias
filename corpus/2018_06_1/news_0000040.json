Air pollution Heavy traffic on the A167 Central Motorway in Newcastle (Image: Newcastle Chronicle)\nLib Dem councillor Greg Stone has asked the council when it will be publishing a clean air plan to tackle pollution in the city.\nIn July last year, Newcastle was named among the areas of the UK that break legal pollution levels on some roads, with the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) pinpointing the A167 between the Tyne Bridge and the Swan House roundabout as the problem zone.\nThe council was ordered by Defra to produce an “innovative” plan to achieve legal Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) levels, but is yet to publish its proposals. Discovery School closure Discovery School Blandford Street, Newcastle (Image: newcastle chronicle)\nTeachers, students and parents were told earlier this month that Newcastle’s Discovery School would shut its doors for good by the end of August.\nThe flagship free school was slammed by Ofsted inspectors, while council leader Nick Forbes called the school’s failure a “damning indictment” of Government’s “high risk experiment” in academisation.\nCoun Nora Casey, the council’s education chief, will bring forward a motion on Wednesday night calling on the Government to give local councils greater powers over academies and free schools and to stop giving “disproportionate” funding to the free school programme.\nThe council will also be debating the city’s annual education and skills report. Read More How a turbulent four years saw the Discovery School fall from high-tech hope to 'Inadequate' failure Theatres’ EU trouble\nThe city’s theatre bosses warned last week that they could face financial ruin because of new EU regulations requiring them to replace older light bulbs used in their lighting rigs.\nThe Tyne Theatre and Opera House, Northern Stage, Theatre Royal, Live Theatre and People’s Theatre all confirmed they will be hit by the changes - which could force them to pay out up to a million pounds on new equipment.\nLabour’s Coun John-Paul Stephenson will call on the council to support the Save Stage Lighting campaign and lobby the EU to find a compromise. Srebrenica genocide\nMembers of Newcastle’s Bosnian community will be in the council chamber as Coun Rebecca Shatwell calls for the authority to remember the Srebrenica genocide, in which more than 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed by Serbian nationalist forces.\nShe will praise the way Newcastle has welcomed Bosnian refugees and the contributions they have made to the city. Read More North East businesses are 'exasperated' by Brexit talks, PM is told Brexit impact on the North East\nCoun Wendy Taylor, a Lib Dem, will tell the chamber “there is mounting and indisputable evidence” of the damage that leaving the EU would cause the North East’s economy.\nShe will ask the council leader to write to local MPs and the Government calling for a vote to be held on the final Brexit deal, including an option for the UK to remain a full member of the EU.
