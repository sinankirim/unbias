Nissan is one of a number of carmakers to have announced job cuts, following a fall in demand for diesel vehicles and uncertainty about the impact of Brexit on the automotive sector. MP Sharon Hodgson (Image: Newcastle Chronicle)\nBanning petrol and diesel cars would encourage motorists to purchase electric vehicles such as the Nissan Leaf, which is manufactured in Sunderland.\nSpeaking in the House of Commons, Mrs Hodgson told Transport Ministers: “I want to talk about the Government’s target to ban all sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2040.\n“The UK is in the grip of an air pollution crisis ... with pollutants responsible for 40,000 premature deaths a year in the UK.\n“I see two problems with the target however. First, it is not ambitious enough to deal with the environmental issue with sufficient urgency or to ensure that the UK maintains its leadership on electric vehicles. A person using a petrol pump (Image: PA)\n“Research shows that bringing the target forward by ten years could nearly halve UK oil imports, support a larger number of jobs overall in the automotive sector and reduce total cumulative carbon dioxide emissions in a shorter period.”\nNissan announced in April it was axing a number of jobs, believed to be hundreds, although the firms is also expected to recruit staff in future years as it begins producing new models.\nJaguar Land Rover recently announced it was cutting production at a plant in Solihull, near Birmingham, and will not renew the contracts of around 1,000 temporary workers. It blamed “continuing headwinds impacting the car industry”. Nissan Qashqai (Image: Handout)\nAround 2,000 jobs have been lost among car manufacturers over the past eight months, and planned increases in staff recruitment have been put on hold. When component suppliers and related sectors are taken into account, it is estimated that between 8,000 and 12,000 jobs have gone.\nThe plan to ban petrol cars is prompted partly by concern about air pollution.\nAnd figures produced by Public Health England show air pollution may have caused 1,073 premature adults deaths in Tyne and Wear, County Durham and Northumberland in 2016.\nVehicle emissions are one of the prime causes, although others include wood fire stoves.\nThe Government has told local authorities to draw up clean air plans and Newcastle, Gateshead and North Tyneside have been named by the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs as councils which must take action because they have roads with high levels of pollution. A person filling their car up (Image: PA)\nCouncils have responded by proposing subsidies to encourage people to cut down on cars, such as cheap bus passes or a grant to buy an electric bike.\nOne option would be to make carmakers pay, according to local authorities - a proposal which is unlikely to go down well with manufacturers.\nThe proposal came from the Core Cities, which includes the city councils of Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle , Nottingham, Sheffield, Glasgow and Cardiff.\nIn a submission to the House of Commons Environment Committee, they said: “A strong fully funded and appropriate suite of mitigation measures will be needed to support low income households and SME ’s [small and medium sized businesses] to travel more cleanly at the earliest opportunity and this should be funded by central Government, perhaps through levies on vehicle manufacturers.\n“Scrappage schemes need to address a range of situations and not simply subsidise people who were going to buy a new car anyway. Therefore they should include mechanisms for people to upgrade from old non-compliant cars to newer but second hand compliant cars and also support measures to enable modal shift – perhaps an annual bus pass or a grant for an electric bike to replace a car.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": ["https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/nechronicle/subscriptions/&quot;}"], "published": "2018-06-02T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-06-02T07:47:22.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
