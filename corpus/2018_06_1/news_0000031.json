However, there is still a great need for new housing in the UK and sales to local builders are generally more resistant to economic declines than sales to consumers.\n“The Magnet brand was repositioned during the year. This work resulted in a simplified purchasing process and a clearer offering. A new website and the ‘Magnet - Part of the family’ campaign were launched at the end of the year.

Profit after tax however, grew from £21.7m to £34.7m.\nDuring the year the number of employees at the group fell from 2,417 to 2,338. As a result, the company’s staffing costs fell from £79.3m to £79m.
