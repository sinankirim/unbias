This means holding a referendum in which one option would probably be to stay in the EU. Theresa May and Catherine McKinnell\nThe letter reads: “As MPs, MEPs and Peers from Sunderland and across the North East of England, we have a duty to our constituents to make sure we are representing them and securing the best possible future for them and their families.\n“That is why we cannot ignore recent warnings from Nissan’s chief executive Carlos Ghosn that the company is ‘in the dark’ over proposed plans for Brexit and that the company has no option but to pause investment plans in the UK until they get more clarity from Downing Street.\n“Over 7,000 people are employed by Nissan in Sunderland, while 30,000 more across the North East rely on the plant as part of the manufacturing chain.
