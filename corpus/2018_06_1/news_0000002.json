In practice, this would mean staying in the EU single market.\nThis could be a difficult vote for Labour, because the party’s official position will be to abstain but many Labour backbench MPs believe the UK should stay in the single market, and are likely to rebel against the party leadership by voting against the Government.\nSedgefield Labour MP Phil Wilson is one of those backing continued membership of the EEA.\nHe highlighted research which suggested leaving would cost the North East £1.1 billion a year, leading to fewer jobs, lower wages and less funding for services such as the NHS.

Even the government’s own economic impact assessment show there will be negative consequences.\n“Open Britain estimate that leaving the EEA will cost the region £1.1bn every year by 2030. That would be like losing the pits a second time.”\nHe said he would be voting to keep the UK in the EEA.\n“I will be supporting the Lords amendment because the UK economy will suffer enough from the disruption to come, and our priority should now be to minimise risk. I fundamentally do not believe people voted to leave the EU to make themselves poorer.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": ["https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/nechronicle/subscriptions/&quot;}"], "published": "2018-06-12T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-06-12T08:21:45.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
