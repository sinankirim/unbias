There were 711 in the Durham police area and 878 recorded by Cleveland police.\nThe figures show there were 2,980 hate crimes in the North East region where race was a factor.\nPolice recorded 340 hate crimes where religion was a factor, 456 involving sexual orientation, 452 where disabled people were targeted and 97 where the victim was transgender. Increase may be connected to terrorism and Brexit\nAccording to the Home Office, the rise in numbers across the country may be partly down to the police doing a better job of recording incidents - but there have also been real increases which appear to be connected to terrorism and to Brexit.\nA Home office report said: \"In 2017/18, there were 94,098 hate crime offences recorded by the police in England and Wales, an increase of 17% compared with the previous year.\n\"This continues the upward trend in recent years with the number of hate crimes recorded by the police having more than doubled since 2012/13 ... this increase is thought to be largely driven by improvements in police recording, although there has been spikes in hate crime following certain events such as the EU Referendum and the terrorist attacks in 2017.\"\nHate crime is defined as \"any criminal offence which is perceived, by the victim or any other person, to be motivated by hostility or prejudice towards someone based on a personal characteristic\". Government announces new measures to fight hate crime\nThe Government announced plans to review the law to consider whether crimes sparked by hostility to women or to men, or prejudice against the elderly, should be considered hate crimes.\nThe Home Office has tasked the Law Commission to carry out a review of current hate crime laws as part of a series of new measures.\nThe review is expected to be published by the end of next year.\nIt forms part of a refreshed strategy aimed at improving the response to hate crimes and incidents.\nNew measures include taxi drivers and door staff being given guidance on spotting hate crime. Home Secretary Sajid Javid (Image: PA)\nAdvice will be included in the Department for Transport's best practice guidance on taxi and private hire vehicle licensing, which is scheduled to be updated in 2019 and will be considered for adoption by all 293 licensing authorities in England, the document says.\nIt also notes that new guidance for door supervisors sets out how they can ensure transgender people can have a safe and enjoyable time going to pubs, clubs, festivals and events.\nThe updated action plan is being published as the Home Office releases the latest annual statistics on hate crime in England and Wales.\nHome Secretary Sajid Javid said: \"Hate crime goes directly against the long-standing British values of unity, tolerance and mutual respect - and I am committed to stamping this sickening behaviour out.

We must stand up to hatred and discrimination wherever it is found.\" Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott (Image: Getty Images)\nMs Abbott said: \"The Tories promised to tackle burning injustices but they are clearly not tackling the injustice of people being attacked simply because of their religion, sexuality, the colour of their skin or their disability.\n\"Tory cuts to the police continue to undermine the fight against crime. Labour will hire 10,000 extra police officers to work in the community to help tackle all forms of hate crime.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": ["https://communicatoremail.com/IN/DCF/wo13VulRxfnD9_IKKGjv78/", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/nechronicle/subscriptions/&quot;}"], "published": "2018-10-17T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-10-17T09:44:10.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
