(Image: PA)\n“But the real Budget is a 100 to 200 page red book with all the details in.”\nThese are the five key points he has uncovered from the report: 1. Personal allowance “The big one”\nFor the past few years, the amount you can earn before you're hit with income tax has been rising. And in April 2019 it will shoot up from £11,850 to £12,500.\nWhat does that mean? “A £130 a year gain for anyone earning over £12,500,” Martin explained.\nThere was even more cash for the better off – with the point you start paying 40% income tax moving from £46,350 to £50,000.

Universal Credit “They are changing it”\nIt's fair to say Martin isn't a fan of Universal Credit.\n“I'm one of those whose been ranting about the absolute disaster Universal Credit has been for many of the vulnerable people in this country – they simply haven't got it right and it should never have been introduced if it wasn't right – it's too dangerous and too damaging,” he said.\nBut Martin pointed out: “They are changing it, both the transition process and the in-work allowance.\n“What that basically means is that if you're on Universal credit you will now be allowed to earn £1,000 more a year from work before your universal credit starts to decrease.”\nWhat's that worth? Around £600 a year to the people affected by the change, Martin said.
