Read More Newcastle MP Chi Onwurah says she knows the name of leading businessman accused of harassing staff\n\"Tens of thousands of good jobs will be at risk, prices will go up even more, and the regional economy will take a massive 16% hit.\n\"A no-deal Brexit might not seem too bad to hedge fund managers and millionaire Tory MPs, but it would be devastating for working families in this region.\"\nAnd she urged the Government to listen to warnings from industry.\n\"Manufacturing is the crown jewel of the North East’s economy. But we know key businesses in this region are losing confidence and that they’re getting ready to press play on their no-deal contingency plans.\n\"If manufacturers are shifting investment, putting off pay talks or even cutting jobs, then working people will pay the price.\n\"But with just months to go, the government still hasn’t provided any reassurance. Instead, Tory politicians are arguing among themselves, putting their own political interests ahead of the national interest.

The government must change course and deliver a deal that protects working people’s jobs and rights.\"\nTheresa May claims a deal on the UK's divorce from the EU is 95% complete, but the Irish border remains a major stumbling block.\nThe Government is reportedly considering chartering vessels to ensure food and medicines can be brought in through alternative routes if there are problems on the Calais-Dover crossing in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\nBrexit Secretary Dominic Raab told MPs: \"We need to prepare for the worst-case scenario, where the authorities at Calais are deliberately directing a go-slow approach, by supporting a diversion of the flow to more amenable ports in other countries.\" Read More North East MPs back challenge to Northern Ireland ban on abortion\nHe added that the Government was looking at \"all possible contingencies to ensure that in a no-deal scenario British businesses and livelihoods are safeguarded\".\nShadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer reeled off a list of legislation, new agreements and measures he said would be required in the next 22 weeks to prepare for no Brexit deal.\nHe said: \"The truth is it's already too late to plan for no deal - this is bluff, not planning. Why wasn't this legislation introduced months ago?\"\nThe Prime Minister will seek to reassure business leaders about the Government's Brexit strategy at a meeting next week.\nMrs May and Chancellor Philip Hammond meet 120 chief executives and investors on Wednesday, two days after the Chancellor presents the last scheduled Budget before Britain leaves the EU in March.\nThe Prime Minister's own position appears marginally more secure after she faced down critics with an \"emotional\" address to Tory backbenchers anxious about her Brexit plans on Wednesday evening.
