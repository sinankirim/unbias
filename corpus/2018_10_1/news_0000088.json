And his speech last week did exactly that.\nA pledge of 400,000 new green jobs is as mad today as it was in 2009 (when Gordon Brown first announced it). A pitch for power, based on recycled hot air. At least this time, Labour admit these jobs would come from the ‘public purse’.\nOf course, government doesn’t have money of its own. This would be your money in higher taxes, higher energy bills, higher borrowing and deferred debt for your children and grandchildren to pay off. But that won’t get a standing ovation in a conference hall. Neil Parish MP\nNeither, I think, would building an extra 7,000 wind turbines on land, whilst creating a raft of new taxpayer subsidies for onshore wind and solar. Instead, we believe subsidies should be reduced in line with falling costs and support should help low-carbon technologies to stand on their own two feet, rather than create dependence on public subsidies, which ultimately drive bills up for consumers.

And we are making good on that pledge; ratifying the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, meeting our legally binding carbon budgets, cutting plastic waste and quadrupling renewable electricity capacity.\nOn top of that, the UK now has enough solar to power almost 2.7 million homes, is the most attractive market in the world for investment in offshore wind and we have already carefully invested £52 billion in renewables, nuclear, and Carbon Capture technology since 2010.

In just a few years, the UK will be one of the first developed countries to close all coal-fired power stations where carbon emissions aren't being captured and stored. Neil Parish MP\nIndeed, Greenpeace have already come out and said Labour is “lagging behind the government” on plans to tackle a range of issues, including plastic waste and ocean pollution, adding that \"we need to see much more action in other crucial areas for Labour to win the title of the greenest major party\". I agree.
