In terms of where we find ourselves right now, allowing your customers and partners into the kitchen, being transparent and open is a great quality to break the lack of trust evident between some organisations and consumers.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": ["https://communicatoremail.com/IN/DCF/wo13VulRxfnD9_IKKGjv78/", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/nechronicle/subscriptions/&quot;}"], "published": "2018-10-14T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-10-14T12:19:05.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
