Caviar imports will be limited\nThis one is hardly going to plunge Brexit voters into a self-hating gloom, but it is going to be harder to bring back caviar.\nIt will join snowdrops, orchids and reptiles on 'endangered species' list and would need import and export permits to cross an EU border. Read More\nHoliday makers will have to settle for bringing back 125g of caviar from Europe. British race horses could cost far more to take to the Ireland Race horses may become much more costly to move around\nAgain, this one will not directly affect most of us, but EU horse passports would not be valid and, depending on how things turn out, the EU could force horse owners to pay Â£500 for travel documents to the Republic of Ireland, or stop travel altogether.\nBreeders of pedigree horses, cattle, sheep, pigs and goats could also find it harder to work with counterparts on the continent.

We could be stuck with no way of exporting our rubbish\nThousands of tonnes of our rubbish is exported to EU countries such as Poland, particularly since China stopped taking it.\nBut if there's no Brexit deal, this will be slapped with a tangle of new red tape. Read More\nAs well as getting permission to export to the destination country, anyone trying to ship waste abroad will also have to submit a request to the EU. EU websites could be blocked in the UK Websites will have the right to refuse us service\nUK citizens are protected by a rule that prevents any online business from discriminating against customers based on their native country.\nBut since that happens to be an EU rule, we will lose that protection next year.\nA technical paper said that in the event of no agreement being reached before the UK leaves the European Union, the regulation would \"cease to have effect\" in UK law.\nUK traders wishing to operate within the EU would still have to abide by the regulations, however.
