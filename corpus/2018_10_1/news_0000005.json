That means firms can import goods into a freeport without paying the usual tariffs.\nAs a result, materials can be imported into an area, turned into products in a factory and exported again, all without paying customs fees.\nIt means global businesses are encouraged to use the freeport as part of their supply chain, creating jobs including in manufacturing.

I listened to people’s ideas and enthusiasm about freeports and invited them to gather their thoughts and come back to us with substantive proposals, and I committed to giving those proposals the consideration they deserve.\n“I remain keen to receive such proposals and to see what we might be able to achieve together.” Read More MP calls for 'Hadrian's forest' to be planted on the border between Scotland and England\nBut he added: “We want to see further business-friendly customs arrangements put in place. Proposals for freeports would need to prove that they will genuinely attract inward investment into the United Kingdom and not simply displace growth that might have happened in other parts of the country.\n\"It must be an additive policy that makes the country more prosperous and does not simply move jobs and investment from other parts of the United Kingdom.”\nSimon Clarke, Conservative MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, and Anna Turley, Labour MP for Redcar, both spoke in favour of establishing freeports.
