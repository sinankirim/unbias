One of the new breakout areas at Neon at Quorum (Image: Newcastle Journal)\nQ10 has been renamed Neon – after the 10th element in the periodic table – to reflect a new direction for the asset managers Broadoak, which enlisted Killingworth architects FaulknerBrowns to create meeting areas, break out spaces and a quirky kitchen alongside 19 units of varying sizes, between which firms can move as they grow.\nThe three-storey Neon building will be officially launched to the market next week, with Knight Frank and Cushman & Wakefield acting as agents. Wandisco, a Californian big data specialist has already signed up for a unit and will move in next month, while several other firms are also eyeing up space. One of the shared spaces at Neon has a Space Invaders arcade game and a pool table (Image: Newcastle Journal)\nIt has taken 12 months to create Neon, starting with visits to several modern workspaces in London to seek inspiration ahead of working with designers, then handing over to the fit out team which has spent six months on the project.\nThe ground floor will have 15 units, the next floor three units and the top floor has room for several hundred people.\nThe flexible space means firms could follow in the footsteps of Insure the Box, the car insurance company which started out with a handful of people and now has more than 300 people in Q11.

The reception team will also act as concierge, doing everything from preparing teas and coffees and taking in dry cleaning to ordering taxis.\n“It’s so much less corporate than the break out areas we developed in our last project, where the seats were all black leather and chrome.” Read More Bellway's turnover approaches £3bn but the firm warns Brexit could dampen sales\nMrs Sykes said: “We wanted to create areas that were more collaborative, with more space and social areas so people can feel they are part of something bigger rather than just going into their own little box. It’s funky, quirky – and no one else out of town has done it.\n“It’s also about attracting talent. Now through technology like Instagram people can post photos of where they work, and that might attract others to the same business.”\nThe opening of Neon follows seven lettings at the park so far this year, including the arrival of software specialist TSG which moved it headquarters to Quorum from Gosforth.
