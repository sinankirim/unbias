There is only one topic being discussion at the moment and we are just going to ignore it.”\nCllr Gordon Hook added: “I know that some Devon farmers are struggling to get food out of the fields as Brits are not doing the work and EU nationals are returning home. We ought to be concerned about that threat to our agricultural industry.”\nWatch: Brexit 'a real opportunity' Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\nBut Cllr Humphrey Clemens, himself a farmer, said: “There are very few farms in Teignbridge where mass numbers of workers for fruit and vegetable picking are required. I don’t hear farmers crying out for farm workers to milk the cows or sheer the sheep.”\nCllr Jeremy Christophers, leader of the council, said that he was happy for people to debate Brexit, but what they were actually discussing was the final version of the Economic Development Plan.

The Economic Development Plan is a strong step forward for this council to be business friendly.”\nThe five year plan sets out how the council will continue to directly support local businesses, broaden opportunities for residents and spur inclusive economic growth across the district.\nThe vision for the Teignbridge economy is to attract a diverse range of well-paid and highly skilled jobs for our residents and workers, to be an attractive place to start and grow a business and to prosper within ecological limits and to enhance the circular economy.\nThe plans include free public Wi-Fi in town centres. Phase 1 would see Teignbridge intend to deliver the installation of a public Wi-Fi solution for Newton Abbot, Teignmouth and Dawlish town centres that would be a no-cost option for the council, where both the provider and the council can profit from the application.\nIf the public Wi-Fi in Newton Abbot, Teignmouth and Dawlish is successful in generating an income for the council, then they will seek to extend the project to Ashburton, Bovey Tracey, Buckfastleigh, Chudleigh and Moretonhampstead town centres.
