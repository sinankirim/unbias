Rates problems, particularly for retailers, are frequently mentioned, and the Chancellor’s rates-relief announcements in the Budget have come too late for some.\n“It’s worth noting that high profile insolvencies can have a knock-on effect for others, too. For every struggling retailer unable to pay its debts, there will be numerous suppliers as well as shop-fitting or delivery firms who come under pressure, while there have been well-publicised troubles in sectors like construction, too. Andrew Haslam, chair of R3 in the North East and head of FRP Advisory LLP’s Newcastle office (Image: Publicity Pic)\n“R3 members have picked up on a number of extra concerns recently. Uncertainty over the shape Brexit will take has led to decision-making delays at some large companies, which will have had an impact on their smaller suppliers expecting new contracts or investment.\n“Infrastructure problems have started to be mentioned, too: traffic congestion is hurting companies, especially those based in city centres, in terms of longer delivery times and loss of productivity.

Negative consumer confidence, high personal debt levels, renewed upwards pressure on wages, and possible future interest rate rises will all have to be navigated. On the insolvency front, yesterday’s Budget saw the Government announce plans to partially restore HMRC’s preferential position in insolvencies, a move which could have unintended consequences for insolvency numbers.\n“With HMRC legislating its way towards the front of the queue for creditor repayments after company insolvencies, other creditors will receive less back after insolvencies, with a knock-on effect for their own finances.\n“The change may also affect banks’ appetite for lending to distressed businesses, jeopardising business rescue. This will be something to watch in 2020 when the changes are due to kick in.”\nNationally, an increase in underlying creditors’ voluntary liquidations (CVLs), which were at their highest level since the first quarter of 2012, pushed up the company insolvency figures. CVLs happen when shareholders of a company pass a resolution that a company is wound up voluntarily.\nThe construction industry had the highest number of insolvencies in past year, followed by the wholesale and retail trade.

Worst hit were furniture and carpets, hardware and DIY stores.
