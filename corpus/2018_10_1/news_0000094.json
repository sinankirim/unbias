(Image: Victoria Jones/PA Wire)\nMr Hammond warned at the weekend that his economic plans depend on a successful outcome to the Brexit negotiations with Brussels.\nIn the event of a no-deal break with the EU, he said he would be forced to tear them up and institute an emergency budget to set the economy on a \"new direction\".\nBut Theresa May's official spokesman insisted that the Chancellor was indicating that he was ready to use his \"fiscal firepower\" to shore up the economy if the UK withdraws without a deal.\nIn his Budget statement, Mr Hammond said he was setting aside an extra £500 million for Brexit preparations, adding that \"if the economic or fiscal outlook changes materially in-year I reserve the right to upgrade the Spring Statement to a full Fiscal Event\".\nSpeaking in the Commons Mr Hammond said he was promising a \"Budget for hard-working families\" and told MPs \"we have reached a defining moment on this long, hard journey\" after repairing the damage to the public finances caused by the financial crash.\nHe said the hard work of the British people was paying off, as the Office for Budget Responsibility predicted 800,000 more jobs by 2023, resulting in more than 4.2 million net new jobs since 2010.\nHe also said the OBR was forecasting sustained real wage growth in each of the next five years.
