So the deal we strike with the EU must ensure that the UK’s regulations and trade relations become truly independent.\n“I continue to be concerned that the Chequers proposal could not give us this regulatory freedom and trade independence.” Read More Treasury invites proposals for 'freeport' to create 25,000 North East jobs\nBut critics of Brexit said Nissan’s decision to delay pay talks showed that workers were suffering because of continued uncertainty.\nNissan, which operates Britain’s biggest car plant at Sunderland, announced it had delayed the start of pay talks with its staff until it has “better clarity on the future business outlook”.\nSunderland Central MP Julie Elliott said: “Once again the uncertainty surrounding the position we are in with the Brexit negotiations is having an impact on workers in the car industry and in the North East.\n“An agreement needs to be reached as a matter of urgency so that businesses can plan for the future.\n“The government are putting tens of thousands of jobs at risk with its chaotic approach to Brexit. They must do more to protect the rights and livelihoods of hard working people in the North East, and across the UK.” Read More\nSupporters of a second referendum on Brexit, or so-called People’s Vote, are to march in London on Saturday, October 20, following the success of a march attended by more than 100,000 people in June.\nThose attending include Sedgefield MP Phil Wilson, who said on Twitter: “I’ll be there”.
