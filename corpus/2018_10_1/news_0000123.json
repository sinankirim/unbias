One called for him to be knighted for his role in Brexit.\nBut 28 months after his work to get Britain out the EU was seemingly done, he admits he didn't expect to still be campaigning.\nAnd demanding MPs \"get on with it\", he warned politicians are doing \"enormous harm\" to the public's trust in the democratic process. Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage enjoys a pint at Wetherspoons in Gateshead Town Centre (Image: Newcastle Chronicle)\n\"They don't want us to leave - the people have spoken but a big majority of our MPs do not want this to happen,\" he said.\n\"They are tied up with this idea that we are somehow safer and more secure inside Europe.\n\"They don't have the imagination and they don't have the courage to think of us as being the independent country we always were.\"\nHis double decker Brexit bus pulled up outside the Gateshead High Street post office on Friday where he was met with a mix of adoration and bewilderment.\nGrinning leave voters shook his hand.

Pro leave supporters wait for Nigel Farage to arrive in Gateshead Town Centre (Image: Newcastle Chronicle)\nAnd this week, he told a Bolton rally he was \"back and 'ready to fight them again\".\nHe's part of a cross-party coalition, touring the country, pushing the message that 'leave means leave'.\nThe others, Tory MP David Jones and Tony Blair's former Minsiter for Sport Kate Hoey, also addressed Friday's rally.\nAnd Mr Farage accused MPs from both sides of letting the public down.

Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage out and about in Gateshead (Image: Newcastle Chronicle)\nAnd regardless of appetite, he claims people are now more sick of just waiting.\nThis could intensify, he feels, after the EU said it was ready for a 'brex-tension' - and extend the post-Brexit transition period of 21 months.\n\"The public want us to get on with it, so the PM coming back yesterday having agreed to having another year of transition goes completely against what people want,\" said Mr Farage.

Founder Tim Martin has campaigned with him while the firm's in-house magazine, read by an estimated four million people, is staunchly anti-EU.\nBut so is Gateshead. It emphatically voted to leave.\nAnd punters backed Farage.\n\"He would do a better job than Theresa May,\" claimed 74-year-old Ken Forrest.\n\"The way things are going with Europe, she's going to ruin it.\"\nAnother, Steve Jones, said: \"It is a disgrace he hasn't been knighted yet.\n\"I voted leave and I'm proud of it - we will be better off.\"\nSmoking a ciggie bought in Brussells, Farage agrees.\nDowning a pint of 6.9% beer, which the bar;s boss insisted is the strongest they sell, Farage tells onlookers he picked it for a reason.\n\"We have a big job on our hands,\" he says to laughs and cheers. But not everyone is receptive.

He voted out while she voted to remain.\n\"I live in hope that the North East will be better off out,\" he said.\n\"I don't,\" she added.", "external_links": ["https://communicatoremail.com/IN/DCF/wo13VulRxfnD9_IKKGjv78/", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/nechronicle/subscriptions/&quot;}"], "published": "2018-10-19T22:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-10-20T00:56:57.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
