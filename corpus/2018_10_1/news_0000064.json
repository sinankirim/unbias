Who knows how they’d behave if you met them in person.\nBut the level of unpleasantness on social media is remarkable.\nAnd Ms Abbott got more abuse on Twitter than any other politician a the last election, according to a study by Amnesty International.

And perhaps she’s such a target because she’s the most well-known black woman in politics.\nMrs May was clearly right to express solidarity with Ms Abbott and to condemn people who send her abuse.\nBut she may have had an ulterior motive.\nBecause there’s a perception that the Labour Party has a particular problem with supporters who behave in a vile way - and that Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has been slow to respond. British Prime Minister Theresa May sits in the audience during the annual Conservative Party Conference (Image: Getty Images Europe)\nIf the Conservative leader takes the moral high ground on the issue, it looks even worse if Labour appears to be failing to do the same.\nThe people sending racist abuse to Ms Abbott are unlikely to have been Labour supporters.\nBut neither did they identify themselves as Tories.\nBy contrast, you do find people on social media who are unpleasant and claim, at least, to be supporter of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.\nFor example, they may use the hashtag #jc4pm, which means Jeremy Corbyn for Prime Minister, or use Mr Corbyn’s face as their own personal photo.\nThat doesn’t happen with Theresa May. Even if they support her, people on the internet don’t tend to use her photo all the time, or add “#tm4pm” to their posts.

But so are Labour MPs deemed to be disloyal to their leader, along with journalists who have dared to report something that paints him in an unfavourable light.\nBBC journalist Laura Kuenssberg is a particular target.\nSome Labour politicians fear “left-wing” trolls are damaging their party. And some have even suggested that Labour’s opponents are making fake accounts pretending to support Jeremy Corbyn, just so they can be abusive.\nWhatever’s going on, it’s not helpful to Labour.\nMrs May’s comments were clearly right, but they were also smart politics.
