The network is creaking. Passengers experience too many things going wrong.”\nHe told the Conservative conference that he apologised for the problems on the rail network this year, and added: “For us as Conservatives it was particularly frustrating.”\nThe Transport Secretary highlighted his proposals to change the way rail franchises operate, in order to join up management of the trains and of rail track and associated infrastructure such as signals.\nMr Grayling said: “The chaos cannot and will not be allowed to happen again.\n“But it is clear that the system has greater challenges than a failed timetable introduction.”\nHe said the Government was investing more in rail services in the North than previous Labour governments, and the Northern Rail franchise was replacing and refurbishing every single train.

One team running track and train.”\nA Government White Paper next year will detail plans for “a rail revolution”, he said.\nMr Grayling also used the speech to announce a new system making it easier to claim compensation for delayed or cancelled rail journeys.\nIt will mean passengers need only make ‘one-click’ to submit their claim once registered rather than entering their details every time. New operators will be expected to make greater use of technology to inform passengers when they are entitled to claim compensation, such as through mobile phone apps.

Heaven knows why that didn’t happen years ago. And it certainly didn’t happen when Labour was in power.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": ["https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/nechronicle/subscriptions/&quot;}"], "published": "2018-10-01T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-10-01T21:51:28.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
