It also launched a new website and doubled its headcount from 10 to 20 employees during the year. \nMr Taylor said: “We’re continuing to make strides in securing new workwear business and are working with some fantastic fashion brands on a national basis.

Recent investment means we now have the ability to embroider or print 50,000 items of clothing per week.” \nWoven’s growth has been supported by Sunderland City Council , which provides advice and guidance to businesses and helps them access the funding needed to expand. \nThe council’s deputy leader Harry Trueman said: “Woven’s ongoing success in the UK and abroad is a fantastic advert for the skills and entrepreneurial spirit of our region. It is an ambitious, young company with huge potential and we’re delighted that it continues to prosper here in Sunderland. We look forward to supporting it in the future.” \nIn 2015 Woven doubled the size of its Washington base after securing access to the Regional Growth Fund. In the same year it landed a global contract with Hamleys toy store.
