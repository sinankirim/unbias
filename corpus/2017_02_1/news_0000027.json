Lincolnshire saw a general rise in overall hate crime last year. However there was no sharp increase in racially or religiously motivated crime in the aftermath of ‘Brexit’. Chief Inspector Dan Whyment, the Lincolnshire Police force lead for hate crime \nIt is the highest quarterly figure since comparable records began in April 2012. \nThe figures place the force at eighth nationally out of all forces across England and Wales. \nHate crime nationally has risen by 27 per cent, with a total of 14,295 reports made across 44 forces - 33 of which reported a record rise. \nChief Inspector Dan Whyment, the Lincolnshire Police force lead for hate crime said there had been an increase in reported crime since different agencies began working together in 2015 and said the biggest number of reports had come from the disabled and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities. \nHe said: “Lincolnshire saw a general rise in overall hate crime last year. However there was no sharp increase in racially or religiously motivated crime in the aftermath of ‘Brexit’. \n“The increase in reporting comes against the backdrop of a multi-agency strategy and delivery plan which has since 2015 (pre dating Brexit) set out to tackle issues of under reporting amongst all hate crime victims. \nIn fact the biggest increases in reporting have been seen from disability and LGBT strands within the community.” \nHe said Lincolnshire Police were continuing to build on existing community projects and had produced a ‘community engagrment plan as part of the partnership. \nHe said: “The continual efforts of all involved mean we have an existing healthy approach to Hate crime in Lincolnshire. Brexit and the knock on effects are of course a consideration, but I feel it is important to get the message across that these efforts are not a knee-jerk reaction. Rather a determined approach to be supportive of victims and communities and demonstrate Hate crime is not tolerated in Lincolnshire.” \nPolice forces in England and Wales can class five types of racially or religiously aggravated offences as hate crimes: assault with injury; assault without injury; harassment; public fear, alarm or \ndistress; and other criminal damage. Forces can also decide to identify other types of offences as hate crimes, however, meaning the overall total could be higher. \nPolice continue to encourage anyone to report hate crime to the 101 number (or 999 in emergencies) or visit www.stophateuk.org. \nHere are the number of hate crime offences recorded by police forces in England and Wales in July-September 2016. \nThey are ranked according to the size of the change compared with April-June 2016 (in brackets).
