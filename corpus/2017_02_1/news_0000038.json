X \nCopy link to paste in your message / Comments (0) \nJose Mourinho has shown his support for sacked Leicester City manager Claudio Ranieri with his own personal tribute to the Italian. \nManchester United boss Mourinho wore a shirt bearing Ranieri's initials 'CR' during today's press conference ahead of Sunday's League Cup final against Southampton. \nMourinho suffered a similar fate to Ranieri, being sacked as Chelsea manager just seven months after leading them to the Premier League title. \nRead more: Brexit, Trump and now Ranieri - a strange decision says Klopp \nThe Portuguese has been quick to show solidarity with Ranieri, also sending out a personal messag e on social media earlier in the day. \n\"The initials in my shirt, with his name, is my little homage to somebody that wrote the most beautiful history of the Premier League, somebody that would deserve the Leicester stadium to be named 'Claudio Ranieri' and has been sacked,\" said Mourinho. \n\"I thought last season when I was sacked as a champion was a giant negative thing. \n\"Now I realise that was peanuts compared with what happened to Claudio. \n\"My Instagram was a little homage, my shirt is another one. I don't think he needs more homages because nobody can delete what he did. \n\"If some of the stories I am reading are true, or have just a little bit of truth, it's difficult to find words to justify that, but it's also something we managers have to be ready to cope with.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T21:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T17:03:00.771+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
