Comments (0) \nBritain's organic market has registered its fifth consecutive year of growth, new figures have revealed. \nThe Soil Association's 2017 Organic Market Report show the growing market is now worth £2.09 billion and total sales of organic products increased by 7.1% in 2016, while non-organic sales continued to decline. \nOrganic farming in the UK remains buoyant and there are new opportunities for farmers, says the report. Organic represents around 1.5% of the total UK food and drink market. \nSupermarket sales of organic have grown by 6.1%, the report adds, while independent retailers have increased sales of organic by 6.3%. \nIn addition, sales of organic home delivery have grown by 10.5% and the organic foodservice market has grown by 19.1%. \nAt a recent meeting between the English Organic Forum and Farming Minister George Eustice, the Camborne and Redruth MP was able to confirm funding for organic farmers will continue for two more years' post-Brexit. The window to apply for support in Scotland is currently open and Northern Ireland is also due to open shortly. \nREAD ALSO: South West Young Farmers Q&A: Five minutes with Ben Cavill \nThe area of farmland in conversion to organic is now slowly beginning to increase after remaining flat or in decline for several years; in 2016 the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) reported the first increase (4.9%) since 2007. \nSoil Association Certification also reports an increase of 13.5% in the number of farmers applying to become certified. However the overall amount of organic farmland in the UK continues to decline despite the growing market demand. \nLiz Bowles, head of farming at the Soil Association, said; \"It has been a difficult time for all British farmers but the future looks positive for organic. We are relieved that organic support is set to continue for new applications until at least 2020 and we are constantly working to ensure organic farming is part of all the post-Brexit agriculture discussion. \n\"There are good opportunities for organic farmers if you find the right market. Dairy, beef, poultry and eggs have all seen sales growth this year. British farmers can take confidence in the fact that UK-produced organic products are highly regarded around the world so export is and will continue to play a big part in UK organic. In addition people are more aware than ever about buying British, and more aware about how their food is produced, which will help increase organic sales in the future.\" \nIncreased consumer demand for organic is coming both in retail and eating out. Here growth is being driven by high street chains like McDonalds and Pret, which are including more organic products on their menus. \nPlus the foodservice sector is in strong growth (19.1%) with more schools, hospitals and workplaces serving organic food. Demand has been influenced by the Soil Association Food for Life Catering Mark with £15 million spent on organic food – an increase of 66%. \nREAD ALSO: PKF Francis Clark: Farmers urged to get Brexit plans in place \nMuch of this has been supported by the Catering Mark Supplier Scheme and there has been a significant increase in the number of wholesalers now licenced to supply organic. \nUK organic sales are catching up with market growth rates around the world. The global organic food market is valued at $81 billion and the UK represents around 4% of global sales. \nIn many countries, British organic is seen as the best that you can possibly buy – particularly in the Far East, US and Europe. Overall, nearly half (49%) of Soil Association Certification licensees are exporting products with an estimated value of exports at £250 million. \nSimon Crichton, Food, Farming and Trade Team Manager at Triodos Bank, added: \"We've helped farmers to finance 1,185 hectares of additional organic land in 2016, a threefold increase on last year. We've seen dairy doing well as are those who have direct relationships with consumers, whose confidence in organic has increased. \n\"There are a number of opportunities for organic farmers at the moment - but those looking to convert, need to have a solid market for their product. \n\"Clearly, having certainty around support payments would be of great assistance but agriculture has always had to take a long term view and organic methods are well placed for both environmental and financial sustainability.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T18:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T13:50:32.793+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
