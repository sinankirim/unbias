If it is approved, there will be further discussion next week in which MPs can attempt to make changes to the legislation. \nLib Dems, the SNP and a small group of Labour backbenchers, including former leadership candidate Owen Smith, have backed an attempt to stop the Bill. \nBut Labour Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said his party believed Brexit should go ahead. 18:32 MPs set to vote over Article 50 \nMPs will tonight vote on triggering Article 50 to start negotiations about leaving the EU. \nThe legislation allowing the Government to trigger Article 50 and start these formal negotiations is expected to pass its first test as it is voted on in the Commons this evening. \nMPs have been debating the bill over the past days, and will tonight have their say.
