Based on what they know today, 11% of voters said they would have switched from ‘leave’ to ‘remain’; 8% said they would switch from ‘remain’ to leave’. Very few voters have voter remorse. I am one of them. Not only did I vote to remain, but I advocated it too. \nIt’s not often that people in public life admit they are wrong. Last March, when I wrote in this column about the EU referendum, I described myself as a ‘reluctant remainian’ and repeated the ‘economic shock’ argument being put by leading economists, media outlets and most political parties. \nFacts, though, are stubborn things. The recent GDP figures, the ever-growing employment figures – which demonstrate more people in work than ever – now need to be taken at face value. The cohort of people – myself included – who predicted the worst, now need to admit they were wrong. I do admit it, in fact the news has been so good for the North East lately, it is a pleasure to admit it. Read More Shopping will cost you more as prices rise, but is Brexit to blame? \nI recently had a discussion with a finance specialist who said the effects of Brexit were too early to tell. The Brexit process, he said, was like watching a brain surgeon perform an operation; it would be a long time before we would know if the patient fully recovered. \nHe might be right about the long term, but the predictions of immediate collapse and failure were wide of the mark and it does nobody any good to pretend otherwise. \nSo why am I so buoyant? Well for starters, the rebalancing of the exchange rate has helped us, the biggest net exporting region of the UK, because we have had a massive boost in the form of price cuts abroad for the goods we export. \nSecondly, Brexit voters – and this region contains the council wards with the largest Brexit majorities – voted to leave despite being told the economy would collapse.

None of my PR clients that rely on consumer spending have reported sales declining. \nThis is one reason why at the NECC & Darlington Building Society Shadow MPC, I have started to vote in favour of an interest rate rise. \nThirdly, even some of the world’s great independent thinkers and business people have started to come around. \nTim Cook, CEO of Apple Inc, has sanctioned a major investment into a new HQ in the UK. He was quoted this weekend saying: “The British are diverse, creative, and resilient and they’re going to do just fine after Brexit.” Also, consider the words of Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury, who was quoted last Friday saying: “I’m not in the slightest bit pessimistic – quite the reverse, I think there are now huge opportunities.” Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks during an Apple special event \nThe economy though is riding high on debt; consumer debt and Government debt. In the long term that is not sustainable. The UK also imports more than it exports and that needs addressing too. \nMrs May seems to recognise the reality of the situation and has created a new department – the Department for International Trade – which is reaching out to businesses with greater urgency and a stronger message. \nThe new Industrial Strategy from the Government is also to be welcomed. It is multi-faceted, which might dilute the impact of its message, but every element of the plan is a priority for one business sector or another. \nThe House of Commons has now effectively agreed Brexit, with only a few of this region’s die-hard EU supporting MPs voting against. Now the recrimination must stop and the people’s instructions need carrying out. What I can’t stand is the snobbery about Brexit, and the sniping from those who lost the argument. Read More North East leaders say Brexit poll reflects the 'uncertain times' we live in \nOn BBC Radio 4 last week interviews were conducted in Middlesbrough and Cambridge, the most pro-Brexit and pro-remain areas respectively. \nThe broadcasters’ theme was education, were those who voted Brexit less well-educated? In a conventional sense they are: Middlesbrough residents have fewer degrees per head of population than Cambridge residents. \nHowever, how much does a Cambridge professor understand about the effects of a factory closure due to emissions regulations emanating from the EU? Have they seen the devastation the resulting unemployment can cause? The people in the know might have the least education, but almost certainly have the most knowledge! Graham Robb, Senior Partner of Recognition Marketing and PR \nI am pleased that Rod Liddle, the acerbic media commentator is attending my IoD dinner next month. He is from the North East and seems to be one of the few London-based media commentators that understands Brexit. He devised a wonderful quiz in a national newspaper to determine if you are a member of the Liberal elite. I’m pleased to say that, even though I voted remain, according to Mr Liddle I was not among the Liberal Elite. \nHowever, in my household we were a bit surprised by my wife’s score, she voted Brexit but was! It just goes to show the issue is more complex that a snapshot poll could ever suggest and making Brexit work is our most important national effort. \nGraham Robb is Senior Partner at Recognition Public Relations. @GrahamRobb Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T20:51:43.078+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
