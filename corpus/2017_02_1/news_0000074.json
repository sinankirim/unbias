If it is approved, there will be further discussion next week in which MPs can attempt to make changes to the legislation. \nLib Dems, the SNP and a small group of Labour backbenchers, including former leadership candidate Owen Smith, have backed an attempt to stop the Bill. \nBut Labour Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said his party believed Brexit should go ahead.

But he said: “As democrats our party has to accept the result and it follows that the Prime Minister should not be blocked from starting the Article 50.” \nWith the support of both the Conservative and Labour leadership there is very little prospect of the legislation being blocked. \nSir Keir also backed calls for the North East to be consulted about the Brexit process. \nHe was responding to comments from Newcastle North MP Catherine McKinnell , who said she wanted to know what discussions the Government has had with the North East about the impact of leaving the single market, “given that 58% of our exports go to the EU.” \nMinisters were forced to bring forward legislation after the Supreme Court ruled Parliament’s approval is needed before the two-year formal Brexit withdrawal process can begin. \nThe Government wants this to start before the end of March.
