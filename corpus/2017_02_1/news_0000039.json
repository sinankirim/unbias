Brexit Secretary David Davis \nThat was an idea that grabbed the public’s attention which may well have tipped the scales in favour of Brexit. \nYet when it came down to it, Brexists like Boris Johnson voted against an amendment to the Brexit bill to include the £350m a week promise in extra funds to the NHS they championed. It’s almost as if they didn’t mean it. \nI was particularly struck by the Davis line that ‘it will be years and years before we get British citizens to do those jobs’. \nI suspect unemployed people would do them tomorrow - but not at the rate many eastern Europeans have been paid. \nFor Brits to do the jobs by law they should be paid £7.20 an hour and there’s an awful lot of people in those sectors mentioned not getting anywhere near that amount. \nThe ‘years and years’ could be the time it will take to get out of the EU after which the government can lay waste to the rights of UK workers that are enshrined in European law.
