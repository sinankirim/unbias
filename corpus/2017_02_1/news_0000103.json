The economy has remained far stronger than expected in the wake of the Brexit vote. \n\"However, there are tentative signs that conditions may be about to soften. \n\"The economy is likely to slow through 2017 as the squeeze on household budgets intensifies and heightened uncertainty weighs on business investment and hiring.\" Read more Brexit has added an 'extra layer of uncertainty to our world' says Nicky Morgan \nEmma Foody, spokeswoman for the National Housing Federation in the East Midlands, said: \"The overall story in England since the economic crash in 2008 has been one of general recovery and success. \n\"However, the housing market has seen a relentless rise in the gap between house prices and people's salaries, and the East Midlands is no exception. \n\"Attaining a mortgage is increasingly unrealistic and private sector rents make saving up that bit more difficult. \n\"As this year's Home Truths report shows, it is more important than ever for the sector to be able to deliver homes that are truly affordable.\" Read more 'Shocking' figures show number of people in Leicester travelling by bus has slumped in last 7 years \nBrendan Walsh is a property expert at law firm Shakespeare Martineau which has a big office in Colton Square, Leicester. \nHe said while uncertainties such as Brexit could effect consumer confidence and house prices, underlying demand remained strong in Leicestershire, and while price increases might slow there would still be growth. \nHe said: \"This is proving to be the case in the high level of activity for home buyers during what was usually a slow January period, and housebuilders active to secure land to meet short term supply. \n\"Despite Government attempts to increase supply in new builds such as the highly successful Help to Buy scheme, demand remains strong and construction has not been increased to the levels required.\" \nWhere the most expensive - and most affordable - homes are in Leicester, Leicestershire & Rutland are...
