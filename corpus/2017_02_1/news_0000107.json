Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nStrong house sales in the North of England have helped cement a healthy six months of trading for housebuilder Barratt Developments . \nThe firm has reported a healthy rise in half-year profits after notching up a large number of completions outside London, citing particularly strong regional sales performances in the North, Scotland, North West and West Midlands. \nThe Newcastle-founded firm said pre-tax profits rose 8.8% to £321m in the six months to December 31, despite revenue falling 3.2% to £1.8bn. \nDirector David Thomas said: “We have delivered another very strong first-half performance, pre-tax profits were up nearly 9% and completions outside of London at their highest level in nine years.” \nTotal completions were down 5.8% to 7,180 with a slowing property market in London dragging on performance. \nCompletions in London came in at 367 versus 842 in the same period last year, although Barratt expects sales in the capital to pick up in the second half of the year.
