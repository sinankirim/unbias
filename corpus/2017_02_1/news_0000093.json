The survey highlighted a significant shortage of quantity surveyors with 69% of respondents highlighting a gap. \nOther roles that respondents reported as having a lack of skilled workers include bricklayers and plumbers, and 45% highlighted a lack of both plasterers and carpenters. \nOther areas reported to be holding the sector back and limiting activity include planning and regulation issues with 69% highlighting this as a problem.
