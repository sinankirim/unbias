However, in this world of Brexit, Farage, Trump, Clinton, May, Johnson and Crobyn, we reckon the UK needs a different kind of party â€“ an official comedy party. \n\"There are plenty of comedians in positions of power, both nationally and internationally, so we thought we would join in. \n\"I am very happy we now have a clear mandate to make everyone laugh, though we may not be quite as funny as some political leaders.\" \nCouncillor Palmer said he fully supported the vote for the comedy party. \nHe said: \"This is one party that sees a sell-out as a good thing.\" \nAfter the vote, a bus took the victorious party members to the National Space Centre for the High Sheriff's Comedy Night. \nThe night, compered by former National Space Centre worker turned professional comedian David Morgan, was in aid of the Warning Zone charity. \nSurinder Sharma, High Sheriff of Leicestershire , was present at the historic town hall vote. \nHe said: \"This is all good fun. \"But the laughter will also enable us to raise money for the Warning Zone charity which helps children deal with the world.\" \nLeicester Comedy Festival started yesterday (WED) with Mark Watson and Richard Herring helping to kick off three weeks of events. \nThe fun on day one included stand-up shows all over the city, beginning with a business breakfast at De Montfort University, where the festival began in 1994. \nRichard Herring's show was at The Cookie, in High Street, at 7pm, while Mock the Week panelist Mark Watson was due to be on at the same venue at 8pm. \nOther venues hosting events on the first day included Manhattan 34, The Exchange, Firebug and the National Space Centre. \nBetween now and February 26 there will be more than 750 events, with performers including Jimmy Carr, Johnny Vegas, Ken Dodd, Stewart Lee, Sue Perkins, James Acaster and this year's Leicester Mercury Comedian of the Year, Tom Lucy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T02:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T22:49:11.622+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
