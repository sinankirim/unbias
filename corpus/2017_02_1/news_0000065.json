The absentees do not go unnoticed. \nThe faux-embittered comedic juggernaut seems displeased that he failed to sell out the first of two Leicester dates and he is determined thereafter to make the audience, as well as himself, work for their night's entertainment. \n'Content Provider' didn't need to be a challenge for anybody. When addressing the treasure trove of accessible material created by recent political happenings, Lee finds a way to simultaneously complain about the short lifespan of Brexit and Trump jokes, whilst also shaping parts of his show around them. \nHe expertly structures opening segments of each act in order to highlight the absurdity of both events and hold a mirror between them. \nAs has come to be expected, Lee's relationship with the audience is suitably jagged. \nHe playfully challenges Leicestershire's political leanings, questions their usage of Gary Lineker as a cultural figurehead and berates audience members attempting a stealth exit to the toilets. \nHe does however, earnestly provide local comedy fans with a recommendation, in the form of Paul Currie, who will appear at the Firebug this Saturday. \nWhat sets 'Content Provider' apart from most of what you will see at the festival is the unique overarching theme. \nWith the help Caspar David Friedrich's oil painting 'Wanderer Above a Sea of Fog', the show's main objective is to explore our position within the chaos of digital consumerism. \nHe tackles social media, dating apps, instant gratification and even 'Game Of Thrones'. It's powerful, it's pointed and it's hilarious. \nAs he points out, Lee is now viewed as a spokesperson for the metropolitan liberal elite. \nMany critics feel as though his main purpose is to massage the pre-existing ideas of his left-leaning audience. \nA Stewart Lee show is engrossing, masterfully crafted and occasionally exhausting. \nMuch to the dismay of Lee's on-stage persona, this left-leaning Leicester audience seem more than happy to receive the aforementioned massage and have their hard work rewarded in a big way. \nLeicester Comedy Festival reviews, video and ticket offers - click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T18:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T14:21:10.403+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
