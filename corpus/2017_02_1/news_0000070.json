Who will be on the panel? \nProducers keep their cards close to the chest on the make-up of the panel but details should be announced after this coming Thursday’s show. \nThere’s been a trend in recent series to try and secure local representation on the panel so Labour might put forward an MP from the region. \nNone of Sunderland’s MPs hold a position in the shadow cabinet so Newcastle’s Chi Onwurah might be a smart bet. \nThe Conservatives are likely to send a big hitter and probably one best placed to hammer home their Brexit strategy given Sunderland’s association with the vote. \nAfter that, it’s anyone’s guess at this stage. \nPossible picks would include North East mayoral hopeful Jeremy Middleton and Sunderland born ex-Apprentice star and entrepreneur Katie Bulmer Cooke. Read More Has Question Time come to Sunderland before? \nQuestion Time last came to Sunderland in June 2009. \nThe programme was filmed at Nissan’s Sunderland plant in the Sports and Conference centre. \nThe panel included Conservative MP Ken Clarke, who was then shadow business secretary, the then Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, Ed Davey, Guardian columnist Polly Toynbee and broadcaster Esther Rantzen.
