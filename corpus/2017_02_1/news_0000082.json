Comments (2) \nLeicester three Labour MPs voted to trigger Brexit last night - despite the their constituents having narrowly voted Remain in the referendum. \nJon Ashworth, Keith Vaz and Liz Kendall were among the 167 Labour MPs who voted to support the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill last night as it was passed overwhelmingly by 498 votes to 114. \nIn June's referendum 51.1 per cent of city voters backed Remain to 49.9 per cent who wanted to withdraw from the EU. \nThe city's MPs had all campaigned for Remain but last night voted to in favour of commencing the negotiations to quit the EU. \nThey did not join 47 of their party colleagues in rebelling. \nLeicester South MP and shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth did not follow the example of 13 of his fellow front benchers who did not tow the party line.

Our side lost sadly. \n\"More people voted leave than remain. I don't like that result but that was the result. \n\"I say we now have to get the possible deal and that's my focus. \n\"I went with allowing the Prime Minister to get on with negotiating Brexit based on the result of a national referendum.\" \nAll of Leicestershire's Tory MPs supported the bill. Voter in their constituencies had solidly backed leaving the Union. \nMPs will spend today poring over a Government White Paper setting out its Brexit strategy as the next battlegrounds in the debate over quitting the EU begin to emerge. \nThey will also be studying a vast list of amendments from MPs of all sides to legislation which paves the way for Theresa May to trigger Article 50 of the EU treaties to begin Brexit. \nHere is how Leicestershire voted in the referendum: Oadby and Wigston", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T16:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T13:51:51.305+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
