Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThe squeeze affecting large parts of the retail sector could be set to worsen after research showing more than half of people in the North East are worried about their lack of disposable income. \nThe research by accountancy group PwC found that more than 20% of consumers in the North East are concerned about the impact of Brexit on their spending plans over the next 12 months, while 56% have concerns about their lack of disposable income. \nPwC’s new Total Retail report found that brand loyalty is important to customers in the North East, but price is still the most important factor for determining customer loyalty with 61% of respondents in the North East sayng they return to a retailer because prices are good. Madeleine Thomson, PwC (Photo: PwC) \nOther important reasons are trust in the brand and items being in stock, while almost six in 10 North East consumers only shop with companies they trust to minimise online security risks. \nThe report comes as many analysts are predicting a tough year for the retail sector, with inflation, increasing business rates, the growth of online shopping and rising wage costs likely to create a series of pressures on shop owners. \nThis week has seen retail giant John Lewis announce a restructuring that will see 400 jobs lost around its UK stores, while the likes of Next and Newcastle-based Fenwick have raised concerns about the challenges facing the industry. \nMadeleine Thomson, retail and consumer leader at PwC, said: “2017 will be a crucial year for retailers; a combination of price inflation on goods and groceries will mean that brand loyalty will play a more significant role than ever. \n“However, with prices on the up and less disposable income available to the average UK consumer as a result, retailers will need to be versatile in order to keep their customers from looking for cheaper options elsewhere. The customer experience is key.” Read More John Lewis to axe 400 jobs as it grapples with pressures facing retail sector \nOther consumer habits highlighted by the report show that 33% of North East shoppers buy online because they find it more convenient than visiting a shop although they do worry about fake goods when doing so. \nThe report also finds that 17% of consumers in the North East would buy British if the product is equal in price, product specification and quality to an imported good, whilst a fifth (20%) say retailers’ mobile websites are an obstacle to making purchases. \nMs Thomson added: “The rise of digital, our reliance on Amazon – 87% of North East shoppers use the site - and increases in wearable and mobile shopping are also highlighted in this year’s survey. \n“However, something else that is equally important is the value that UK shoppers continue to place on in-store experience, with the number one in-store attribute being shop staff with a deep knowledge of their product range. \n“As we look ahead, the ‘Total Retail’ experience looks to be defined as simple and streamlined; one that maintains a human touch, blending the best of technological advances with helpful and expert staff both in-store and online.” \nFigures released this week showed a small rebound in retail sales, which cooled predictions of a slump in consumer demand. \nRetail sales volumes grew modestly in the year to February following a fall in January, according to the CBI’s latest quarterly Distributive Trades Survey of 128 firms.
