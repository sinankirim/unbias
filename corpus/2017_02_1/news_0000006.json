But he pulls no punches when offering his opinion on his own side either. \n\"We are attacking the small things to the detriment of the bigger picture,\" said Pie as he tells us on the left that we are the reason that the Conservatives are still in power and that Trump has taken over America. \nWhile elements of the show felt a little out-dated - he spends a good fifteen minutes talking about how much he hates David Cameron - overall Pie is incredible at pulling the room from fits of laughter as he reels off personal insults about our least favourite politicians. \nJust as he is equally good at reminding us just how horrifying things are with commentary on the homeless crisis in the UK. \nAs he leaves, he reminds us that we need to \"get our s*** together\". In a world where politics feels so helpless I think he may have a point. \nLeicester Comedy Festival reviews, video and ticket offers - click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T18:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T14:21:17.333+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
