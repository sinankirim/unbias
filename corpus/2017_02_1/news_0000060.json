We are pleased with customer activity in the first eight weeks of the 2017 spring season.

We have experienced a normal week-on-week strengthening of the market on entering the 2017 spring selling season.” \nBuyer demand and house prices have been surprisingly resilient since the referendum, the company said, thanks largely to rock-bottom borrowing costs after the Bank of England halved interest rates to 0.25% in August. \nPersimmon also flagged the “overall shortage of supply of housing in the UK” as a factor providing support to the market.

The firm’s interim results showed it had sold 451 homes in the first six months of 2016/17, 51 more than the same period the year before.

It continues to experience strong demand both in its established operating areas and in the new areas into which it is expanding.
