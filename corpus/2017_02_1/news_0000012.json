MP Hillary Benn visited Boston today (Thursday). \nMore than 30 members of the public sat around six tables, with each tables’ discussion led by one of the committee MPs. \nMr Benn circulated the room as discussions took place, as did Boston and Skegness MP Matt Warman. \nThe questions people were to answer were: Why did Boston vote to leave the EU by such a margin? How should migration be controlled once the UK leaves the EU? What are the risks and opportunities of Brexit for Boston? \nResidents raised a number of points, many of which have been said before, including the speed of immigration, the effects on employment and economy, infrastructure and the feeling that Government weren’t listening. \nThey also said there were opportunities to bring the communities in Boston together, to catch up infrastructure and find ways to retain young people in the town. \nThe video above shows some of Mr Benn’s visit along with interviews with MP Matt Warman and Lincoln MP Karl McCartney. \nFor more see next Wednesday’s Standard.
