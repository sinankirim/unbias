Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA North East MP has revealed her dad voted for Brexit after losing his job to immigrants. \nSouth Shields MP Emma Lewell-Buck told the story to explain why so many North East people voted to leave the European Union, as the House of Commons voted for historic legislation allowing Brexit to go ahead. \nMPs approved the Government’s European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill, which allows the Prime Minister to begin the Brexit process, by 498 votes to 114, a majority in favour of 384. \nIn an earlier vote, MPs rejected an attempt by the SNP to block the Brexit Bill, with 100 voting for the SNP amendment and 336 voting against it. A Union Jack flag flutters in front of Big Ben (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \nOnly one North East MP voted against the legislation - Newcastle North Labour MP Catherine McKinnell. \nThe Conservative and Labour leadership both backed the Bill, making it almost certain to be approved. \nBut Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was hit by resignations from his Shadow Cabinet, as Shadow Environment Secretary Rachael Maskell and Shadow Diversity Minister Dawn Butler quit over the decision to order Labour MPs to vote for Brexit. \nThis vote was for the Bill’s ‘second reading’. Next week, there will be debates and votes on attempts to amend the legislation, followed by a crucial ‘third reading’ vote. South Shields MP Emma Lewell-Buck \nAssuming it is approved by MPs once again, the debates then move to the House of Lords. \nMs Lewell-Buck was one of a number of MPs to deliver personal and sometimes emotional speeches. \nShe said her dad, a retired welder, voted to leave after shipyard owners found it cheaper to “exploit” migrant workers. \nThe MP said: “The yard owners could pay them so little it was no longer a good business model to have people like my dad employed there. \n“In short, he lost his job. \n“When people see Governments not fighting for them and allowing people to be exploited, they lose faith and they become angry. \n“No Government should ever underestimate what unemployment can do to people, their families and their communities, because these scars last. \n“This referendum was a chance for people like my dad to vent their hurt. \n“In areas like mine, this referendum was lost a very long time ago.” \nIn the same debate, Newcastle MP Chi Onwurah said her “conscience” won’t let her vote for the Conservative version of Brexit. Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn (Photo: PA) \nShe backed the Bill in its second reading - but said she could vote against it next week. \nMs Onwurah , the MP for Newcastle Central and a Labour Shadow Business Minister, said Brexit was changing the nature of British society and encouraging the type of views held by US President Donald Trump and the American far-right movement known as the alt-right. \nShe said: “Over a third of children in Newcastle live in poverty, and one in five of my constituents claim benefits. North East workers are on average almost £4,000 per year worse off than 10 years ago. \n“Am I going to vote for a Trumpian, dystopian, Alt-right, free market future for them? No. \n“Already constituents are asking me questions I never expected to hear – might they be deported to the EU? Just how racist does an insult have to be before they should complain? Will there be a nuclear war and which side will we be on? \n“The Government needs to accept amendments to this Bill which ensure our values, our social model and our membership of the single market are safeguarded. \n“Otherwise Mr Speaker, democracy, my constituents and my conscience will ensure I am unable to vote for this Bill at Third Reading.” \nMany leading ‘remain’ campaigners admitted defeat - and said they now had a duty to vote to leave the European Union. \nThey include County Durham MP Phil Wilson, Labour MP for Sedgfield, who said: “As strongly as I hold my views, it is only right that the wishes of the majority of the British people should be respected,” Tom Blenkinsop \nTom Blenkinsop, MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, was another remain campaigner who said he was voting for Brexit. \nHe said in a statement: “I voted for a referendum and then campaigned for Remain. Remain lost, so the UK must leave the EU.” \nThe Government’s promised white paper setting out its strategy for withdrawal from the European Union will be published on Thursday, Theresa May has announced. \nDowning Street said the White Paper would “reflect the Government’s plan for Brexit as the PM set out in her speech on our negotiating objectives”. \nLabour leader Mr Corbyn will decide later on how to respond to any rebellion among junior frontbenchers over Article 50, but has already said that shadow cabinet members who vote against the whip cannot remain in his top team. \nA source said: “Any discipline issues relating to debates and the whipping will be dealt with later.” \nLabour has not yet decided whether there will be a three-line whip on the third reading of the Bill, with the opposition waiting to see what amendments are made to the legislation. \nBut the source insisted that Labour would not “block or frustrate” the triggering of Article 50.
