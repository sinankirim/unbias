At least 60% of the packaging is reserved for health warnings. Will there be an appeal? \nThe High Court threw out a challenge by tobacco companies last year. Read More Are you legally allowed a smoking break at work? Your rights explained But it’s an EU law, could it be scrapped after Brexit? \nMaybe. In August last year, the Sun asked the Department for Health if Brexit could see the menthol ban overturned. \nThe Department for Health told The Sun newspaper: “This is one of the many areas that the Government will want to consider carefully as part of the process of leaving the EU.” \nBut, it’s worth remembering Britain has long heavily-taxed cigarettes, at a rate higher than other EU countries, indicating the Government would be unlikely to soften regulations. Is it a good idea? \nWhen the move was announced last year, it was welcomed by Newcastle City Council. \nCoun Nick Forbes, chair of the North East’s Making Smoking History Partnership and leader of Newcastle City Council, called appealing tobacco branding aimed at children “one of the scandals of the 20th century”. \nHe added: “Changing tobacco packs will help us to reduce the appeal and image of smoking, ensuring future generations are much less likely to develop chronic smoking related illnesses.” Read More More pay, higher car tax, more free child care - how laws coming in in 2017 could affect you What have the experts said? \nDr David Hambleton, chief executive of South Tyneside Clinical Commissioning Group and chair of the Northern CCG Forum, also welcomed the new law and said: “As senior clinicians and commissioners of healthcare services in the North East we see at first-hand the damage that smoking does to the health of people in our region. \n“Smoking harms nearly every organ of the body and reduces both quality of life as well as life expectancy.” \nAilsa Rutter, director of regional smoking action group Fresh, said: “This is a momentous step which will make smoking history for more children in our region and across the country. \n“Hundreds of children start smoking every day and for far too long, tobacco companies have gift-wrapped their poisonous, killer products with bright colours that disguise the death and disease smoking causes.” \nJohn McClurey, an independent newsagent with a shop in Newcastle and a member of Gateshead Council, said: “Working more than 30 years behind the counter, I have seen how the marketing tactics of the big tobacco machine works. I have seen how new tobacco products in bright, attractive packaging come in and the way they appeal to young people. \n“I am certain that the introduction of standardised plain packaging of tobacco products will reduce the appeal and help lower the temptation for more children to start smoking.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T15:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T10:32:34.769+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
