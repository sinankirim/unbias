These were once frequent occurrences at Westminster, but have become much rarer since the introduction of “family-friendly” hours in 2003. \nA number of MPs from English constituencies were also set to call for English regions to be consulted. Catherine Mckinnell \nThey included Newcastle North MP Catherine McKinnell , who said she was concerned about a promise made by David Davis, the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, to consult mayors. \nWhile Liverpool, Manchester and the Tees Valley area are to elect mayors on May 4, plans for an elected mayor for seven North East councils have fallen through. \nMs McKinnell said: “We’ve had vague promises from the Government about holding ‘a meeting in York’ for mayors from the north, after elections are held in May.

Are we going to be excluded from this process, despite the huge impact leaving the EU – and particularly the Single Market – will have on our region? \n“And surely any such discussions need to start well before May, given the tight two-year negotiating timescale the Government is facing.
