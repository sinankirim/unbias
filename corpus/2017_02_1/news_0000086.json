Durham University's Prof Thom Brooks says Britain's refusal to accept lone children from Syria is perverse and wrong Share Get daily updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing! Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nEarlier this week I was invited to speak in the Houses of Parliament about the continuing migration crisis and what Britain can do about it. The meeting was organised in the grand-looking Gladstone committee room by the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Refugees, a cross party and so non-partisan group of MPs, Peers and supporters galvanised around policies affecting refugees. \nThe audience was a wide-ranging assembly of political opinion including Tories, Labour, SNP, Liberal Democrats and cross-benchers – even Lord Tebbit sat in for most of our discussions. My fellow panellists were distinguished members of organisations like Amnesty International, the Refugee Council and UNICEF and chaired by the tireless and charismatic Lib Dem Peer the Lord Revd Roberts of Llandudno, one of Britain’s greatest champions for the rights of refugees. \nOur focus was to discuss the government’s to be proposed safeguarding policy for unaccompanied child refugees. We have all seen the harrowing images of migrants fleeing war torn parts of the world – many of which are areas where the British military is engaged actively trying to help bring peace and stability. I’m sure we all hope that the violence soon ends and community rebuilding starts swiftly, but we can neither expect all who live in harm’s way to simply persevere and cling on until that hoped-for happy ending becomes a reality. \nWar and desperation have led many to leave their homes perhaps forever in search of safety as refugees. Not all who begin this difficult journey live to complete it. For those of us who have never had any comparable experience, it is almost impossible to fully understand the hardships so many face that the rest of ‘us’ – who live and work in our region – do not. \nSome of the migrants seeking refuge are children travelling with family, but others have lost their families during a conflict in their home country or parents have become separated or died while on a journey to a brighter future. \nThe Labour Peer the Lord Dubs , who was himself a Holocaust survivor and an unaccompanied child receiving refuge in Britain, called for what was is known as the Dubs Amendment – where Britain would accept up to 3,000 lone children from Syria who satisfy the requirements for receiving asylum. \nSo there was much to discuss at our meeting to inform government policy. How should it manage effectively the processing of claims, the introduction to this country and their integration into British life? \nLess than an hour before our meeting started, Lord Roberts got wind the government had decided to scrap the Dubs Amendment. Despite promising hundreds and a few thousand, they now said no more than 350 in total. A little more than 10% of what was planned. And this was released on the day of the Brexit Bill vote in the House of Commons – a time where the government thought it wise to knowingly, foreseeably and avoidably bury this bad news at a time and place few news outlets would report it. \nTheresa May’s government sends out a loud signal about what Brexit means for Britain by this action. If Brexit means Britain will once again be free standing on its own feet and able to become the country we want to embody, we’re now a country so ready for global leadership that we immediately slam our collective door tightly shut on the world’s most vulnerable people. A country cannot be great that turns its back so readily to those who are so small. \nWe also see May’s government offering not a compassionate conservativism, but a moderate Trump-ism. Trumpology is the new faith in 10 Downing Street. While Trump wants to shut the door on all refugees, Britain’s elevated role is to only shut out the most vulnerable refugees. What motivates the Prime Minister to mimic a widely condemned – at least in Britain – policy by the increasingly unstable and irritable President Trump is anyone’s guess. If being mean and turning our back on British values is the price to pay for a deal with Trump, it is perhaps a Faustian bargain we should avoid. \nMoreover, it is alarmingly perverse to target and U-turn on children. Let’s get some things straight. Yes the general public has concerns about immigration and tends to inflate how many are asylum seekers. Now in our seventh year of Tory-led governments, the facts remain that net migration has never been higher than under Tory-led governments. The more they promise to bring it down, the higher it goes than we ever saw under Labour. If the public wants less net migration in fact – rather than empty promises – they had less under Labour even at the height of Eastern European migration. \nAbout 16% of all immigrants claim asylum and 60% have their applications refused. This means asylum seekers who can stay are only about a small handful – and British citizens coming back from gap years or work abroad count for more net migration into Britain than refugees. Lone child refugees are the smallest number of the lot – and yet it is they the government wants to prevent. If it’s about compassion, they’re wrong. If it’s about reducing net migration, they’ve lost the plot. \nIn my remarks to the parliamentary group, I highlighted four concerns. First, the government should get clear on its existing duties before committing itself to new obligations. The Home Office waited until bulldozers came to demolish the Calais Jungle, yet our duties to migrant children were already in place long before. \nSecondly, the government should address inconsistencies like the postcode lottery of guardianship that supports lone child refugees in Scotland and Northern Ireland, but not in England or Wales. \nThirdly, all efforts seem concentrated on how to keep people out with little attention to what to do with supporting those who have come in. We need to act much more on integration recognising it is a two-way street where individuals and communities have roles to play. \nFinally, we need a champion for the cause. If the government supports taking any asylum seekers, as it does, then it needs to act like it. We all know where Trump stands even if we disagree with him. The government must either show some leadership or find someone independent of government who can show it for them. \n* Thom Brooks is Head of Durham Law School and author of Becoming British (Biteback 2016) \n@thom_brooks", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T21:33:31.824+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
