Below is her speech to the House of Commons in full: MP Chi Onwurah \nMy constituency voted to remain. \nMy country voted to leave. \nMy conscience continues to believe that the country’s interests are best served within the European Union . \nI believe my job is to act in accordance with my conscience in the interests of my constituents within the parliamentary democracy I am proud to uphold. \nI believe that my constituents’ trust and belief in parliamentary democracy is the greatest security our country has against the rise of fascistic leaders and the destruction of our national value system. \nSo it would be wrong to reject the result of the referendum. Newcastle is part of a nation, and that which unites us is greater than that which divides us. \nSo for that reason I will vote for the second reading of this Bill.

This Government is attempting a constitutional land grab. The referendum was about the will of the people, not the will of a Prime Minister who is not even elected. \nSome 52% voted to leave the European Union. But they did not vote to leave the single market. They did not vote to leave the Customs Union. \nThe North East is the only region in the country to export more than it imports and more than half goes to the EU. It is estimated that 160,000 jobs are directly linked to our membership of the Single Market whilst our great universities received £155m EU funds in the last funding cycle alone. \nWhen I talk to businesses they are incandescent that Tories, Tories, decided to reject the greatest free trade alliance on the planet. \nAnd I can also say that having negotiated joint ventures, regulatory undertakings, multi-million pound contracts across three continents I have never come across a negotiating position as inept as this Government’s.

They will sell our socio-economic birth right for a mess of right wing pottage. \nWhen the Chancellor talks of ‘changing our economic model’ he means turning the UK into a low wage, low skill tax haven with little or no welfare support. Trying to mitigate the impacts of World Trade Organisation tariffs with tax cuts. \nMr Speaker, over a third of children in Newcastle live in poverty, and one in five of my constituents claim benefits. North East workers are on average almost £4,000 per year worse off than 10 years ago.
