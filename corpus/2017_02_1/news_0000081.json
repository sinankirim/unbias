In his speech, Mr Clarke, who represents Rushcliffe, over the border from Mrs Morgan's own constituency, compared post-Brexit trade hopes to Alice in Wonderland. \nMrs Morgan said: \"Boy, does he show us how it's all done. I campaigned, like others on this side, for remain, but I accept the democratic vote and we should allow the Article 50 notice to be triggered. \n\"I do agree with those who say if we do not do that, a crisis in our democracy, which a defeat for this bill would lead to, helps no one.\" \nHowever she added: \"Leaving must not undermine our economy. It must not unduly affect the jobs and the household finances and financial security of our constituents \n\"Leaving must not undermine our constitution. That was tested in the courts and I welcome the decision of the high court, which was upheld by the supreme court. \n\"Finally, it must not undermine our values as a country. I have to be honest - never in my adult life have I felt so concerned about the stability and the state of the world in which we live. \n\"I have to say I think, with the Brexit vote, we have added an extra layer of uncertainty to our world.\" \nRead more: 'Shocking' figures show number of people in Leicester travelling by bus has slumped in last 7 years \nSome Labour MPs and shadow ministers have said they would not follow leader Jeremy Corbyn's three line whip and support the bill tonight. \nA spokesman for shadow health secretary and Leicester South MP Jon Ashworth said he would support the bill despite having campaigned to remain in the EU. \nA spokesman for Labour Leicester West MP Liz Kendall said she would support the bill too. \nKeith Vaz's office did not respond to a Mercury inquiry about how he would vote. \nAll the county's Tory MPs are expected to back the Brexit Bill as it passes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T22:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T18:23:24.877+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
