Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nNorth East peers are hoping to force the Government to consider the effects of Brexit on the region , when Article 50 legislation is debated in the House of Lords next week. \nThe European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill, which authorises Prime Minister Theresa May to begin the process of leaving the European Union, is to be considered by peers after it was approved without amendments by the House of Commons. \nIt means the Lords will have an opportunity to add amendments of their own, and peers attempting to alter the Bill include Liberal Democrat Lord Shipley, a former leader of Newcastle City Council , and Baroness Quin, the former Labour MP for Gateshead East and Washington West. Baroness Joyce Quin, former prisons and probation minister and former Labour MP for Gateshead East and Washington West (Photo: Sunday Mercury) \nTheir amendment would prevent Mrs May from triggering Article 50 until the Government has produced an “an assessment of the impact of withdrawing from the European Union , and Her Majesty’s Government’s negotiating strategy for withdrawal, on the economy of the North East of England.” \nIt follows a similar unsuccessful attempt by Newcastle North MP Catherine McKinnell to force the Government to consult council leaders and mayors in English regions about its Brexit strategy. \nSome MPs and peers in the North East are unhappy that the Government is consulting the leaders of devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland about Brexit, but does not appear to have made the same commitment to English regions. \nBrexit Secretary David Davis has promised to meet “mayors of the north”, but it is unclear where this leaves areas such as County Durham, Gateshead, Newcastle, North Tyneside, Northumberland, South Tyneside and Sunderland, which are not electing a regional mayor. Brexit Secretary David Davis \nThe North East economy is also particularly dependent on exports. Speaking in a debate, Sedgefield MP Phil Wilson said: “The EU single market is essential to the north-east of England: 58% of the region’s trade is with the EU, which is a full 10% higher than the national average; it is the only region that exports more than it imports; more than 100,000 jobs in the region rely on trade with the continent.” \nThe Bill is to receive its second reading in the Lords on Monday 20th February and Tuesday 21st February. Debates are likely to continue late into the night, but there is unlikely to be a formal vote at this stage. \nAmendments will be considered on Monday 27th February and Wednesday 1st March.
