What has he said? \nMr Davis, who is the cabinet minister tasked with making a success out of leaving the European Union , has been visiting the Estonian capital, Tallinn. \nHe told Bloomberg that Britain will not be able to fill some jobs without importing labour from the continent. \nThese include roles in farming, restaurants and looking after the elderly. \nHe said: “In the hospitality sector, hotels and restaurants, in the social care sector, working in agriculture, it will take time - it will be years and years before we get British citizens to do those jobs,” \n“Don’t expect just because we’re changing who makes the decision on the policy, the door will suddenly shut: it won’t,” Why can’t British people take the jobs?
