UK! But who are the very coolest? \nWell, here at DevonLive we've deliberated, cogitated and digested (as the uncool Lloyd Grossman once put it) and come up with the 50 men and women we consider to be so cool they are virtually freezing. \nWhether they are musicians, artists, eccentric characters, sportsmen and women or just all-round dudes, take a look and see what you think - you might even be on the list! Rosie Huntington-Whiteley \nPlymouth-born model and actress Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has officially hit the big time! \nAs well as modelling for the likes of Victoria's Secret and Burberry, she has also starred in films including Transformers and Mad Max: Fury Road. \nAs well as this, she's even launched her very own range for M&S - not bad for a janner! Damien Hirst \nThe world's richest living artist could afford to live anywhere in the world and, quite understandably, spends quite a lot of time at his house in Combe Martin. \nMr Hirst has also contributed a lot to North Devon by opening a restaurant and gallery on the Quay in Ilfracombe and, most famously, donating the 20-metre bronze statue Verity to the town on a 20 year lease. It doesn't come much cooler than that! Joss Stone \nJoscelyn Eve Stoker, better known by her stage name Joss Stone, is a singer, songwriter and actress who rose to fame in late 2003 with her multi-platinum debut album The Soul Sessions, which made the 2004 Mercury Prize shortlist. \nThis Devon diva and soul songstress spent her teenage years in Ashill, a small village near Cullopmton, and has regularly performed in the county - including at the Barnstaple Christmas Lights Switch On event in 2007. Matt the Hat \nThis North Devon legend and owner of the vinyl specialist Discovery Records is known, as his moniker suggests, for his trademark head gear. \nAs well as being a music offianado and DJ, he is also an avid hitchhiker and has also organised fundraising concerts for causes including the Litchdon Street Almshouses in Barnstaple. One word - cool. Lily Cole \nShe is a supermodel, the founder of socially networked gift economy website, and also part-owner of a London bookseller. \nThe Torquay-born 29-year-old also graduated from King's College, Cambridge with a double first after reading history of art – the same degree that Prince William did. \nShe also played a Sea Siren in Doctor Who, and has been 'graphically murdered' in several music videos. Andrew Cotton \nWhat can we say about Cotty that hasn't already been said? This plumber from Croyde is a leading light in big wave surfing - not just in the UK, but across the globe! \nHis terrifying antics have seen him ride waves which some claim to be the largest ever ridden. \nHe has also featured in documentaries by Red Bull and scooped a number of prestigious sponsorship deals. An all-round action man! Liza Prideaux \nBarnstaple beauty blogger and YouTube star Liza Prideaux has experienced serious success online with her social media platforms attracting thousands of followers. \nThe 27-year-old, who is also a part-time customer adviser, balances her busy work life with caring for her two children - while also creating super-handy hair and make up videos which are watched by tens of thousands of people online. \nVery cool! Matt Bellamy \nThe Muse frontman is the lead vocalist, guitarist, pianist and principal songwriter of one of the biggest bands on the planet. \nFrom Teignmouth, he had headlined the Pyramid stage on all three nights of the Glastonbury festival. \nMany of his songs display revolutionary views as well as an opposition to political corruption, he has appeared as a playable character in the video game Guitar Hero 5, and has dated a succession of blond supermodels, including American actress Kate Hudson who he has a child with. Hector Christie \nThe eccentric owner of Tapeley Park in Instow is the epitomy of cool. \nWhen he's not dressing up as a potato to protest GM crops, or kissing his pet goose on Channel 4's 'Come Dine With Me', he can be found organising eco-events and all manner of wild parties and fundraising concerts. \nThose in the know will also be aware that he is a top footballer too! Lauren Pope \nThis actress and glamour model, who made her name in The Only Way Is Essex, hails from the Torquay area. \nShe made her name as a DJ and has even released a couple of albums - as well as being romantically linked to Prince Harry (several years ago). Tony Butler \nThere aren't many colleges that can boast genuine, bonafide rock stars among their teaching ranks - but Petroc in Barnstaple is one of them! \nFormer Big Country bassist and all-round music industry legend Tony Butler runs Petroc's music and music technology programmes, giving young musicians in North Devon a real insight into the industry. Very cool! \nAs a footnote, we feel we should also include his course colleague tutor Tom Norden - AKA The Silver Fox - who is also extremely cool! Johnny Kingdom \nWildlife filmmaker, photographer and presenter Johnny Kingdom is the epitome of North Devon cool. \nA true local celebrity, Johnny can always be found in the markets wearing his trademark camouflage gear and leather hat. \nGet chatting to him and you will soon see the passionate nature enthusiast beneath that rugged exterior. Star The Duck \nEver seen a duck wearing a bow tie wandering around the High Street of your local town? No? Well in North Devon it's a regular occurrence. \nStar the Duck, and his owner Barrie Hayman, are a common sight on the streets of Barnstaple where Star charms locals and visitors into donating money to good causes. \nHe has also featured on television and is even the star of his own book - it doesn't get much cooler than that! Laura Crane \nIt's official - Laura Crane is living the dream! \nThe model and surfer from Croyde spends her time travelling the world, surfing some of the best spots on the globe and partying hard with beautiful people in exotic locations everywhere. \nDon't believe us? Check out her Instagram account - I challenge you not to seethe with envy! Mau Mau \nThe work of graffitti artist Mau Mau will be very well known to most locals. \nHis trademark fox and other eye-catching characters can be seen all over North Devon, with his most popular pieces including the mermaid underneath the new Bideford Bridge and the large fox on the side of a barn near Instow which is seen by hundreds of drivers every day. \nThe often political nature of Mau Mau's work has earned him a healthy global following and he regularly creates pieces for sale and display all over the country. Jenna Witts \nWoolacombe's very own songstress Jenna is one of the nicest and coolest people you will ever meet. \nWith most of her music taking strong inspiration from the sea and rugged North Devon coastline, her style varies from laid back and mellow to wailing soul siren. Rob Tibbles \nSurf photographer and resident North Devon Journal snapper Rob Tibbles was one of the first names we knew had to be on this list. \nHis cheeky grin and colossal lens can be found on any given day at numerous North Devon's surf spots, papping those lucky enough to be in his eyepiece. \nA stalwart supporter of the local surf scene and vital member of Surfing GB, Rob is one of the people putting North Devon surfers well and truly on the map. A serious local talent and the definition of cool! Kirstie Allsop \nCrafty homemaker Kirstie is a well-known face on television, so when she decided to make over a house in Welcombe for a Channel 4 series we were delighted to welcome her to the region. \nAnd you can experience her homely creativity yourself by staying at her 'Homemade Home' in North Devon, which is available to rent through Classic Cottages. Johnathan Riddington Young \nSo how on earth does an otolaryngologist make it onto the cool list? And what even is an otolaryngologist? \nWell, Mr Riddington Young, a former senior surgeon at North Devon District Hospital specialising in ear, nose and throat treatment (that's what an otolaryngologist is), is controversial - and controversy is cool. \nDuring his many years at the hospital he was a passionate and outspoken critic of NHS managers and has even written a book on the topic. He also drew attention when he turned up to a disciplinary tribunal - after being temporarily suspended for making a racist remark - wearing African dress (he had already been exonerated by the Race Relations Board and the police). \nAnd just look at that moustache! Thomas Carr \nDevon's newest recipient of a Michelin Star is a MAJOR dude! \nAs well as his boyish good looks, surfing heritage and heavily tattooed arms, Thomas Carr can cook! \nHaving trained under Nathan Outlaw and worked with Michael Caines, he joined the Michelin Star ranks himself in January after a secret visit from judges at his Ilfracombe Olive Room restaurant. It's fair to say he is North Devon's very own celebrity chef! Diana Lewis \nPassion, enthusiasm and determination are all cool traits - and Diana Lewis has bags of them all! \nAs the founder of North Devon's Animal Ambulance, Diana gives up countless hours of her spare time and energy to protecting and saving injured and abandoned animals of all species across North Devon. \nI don't know about you, but we think that's pretty cool! Taz Knight \nOK, there's a quite a few surfers in our cool countdown - but there are loads of great surfers in North Devon - and they're all cool! \nTaz Knight is no exception! Taz's big wave exploits have seen him riding giants such as Mavericks in California - and also getting battered by huge slabs in Mexico. \nHe also pally with Cotty - also featured in the list - and no doubt has a big future ahead of him! Lizzie Kelly \nMaking your way in the harsh world of horseracing is difficult enough - and it's even tougher if you are a young woman. So it helps if you have bucketloads of talent and attitude to match. \nGeorge Nympton jockey Lizzie made history when, at the age of 22, she became the first woman to win a Grade One jumps race in Britain. \nShe also has forthright views on the sport and is not afraid to express them - making her in demand as a pundit on BBC radio and Channel 4. Tommy Langford \nA British, Commonwealth and Intercontinental middleweight boxing champion, Tommy is no doubt one of the finest athletes North Devon has produced. \nAlthough being punched in the head for a living may not be perceived as 'cool' – the skill, dedication and glory that goes with the territory may sway people's minds. \nHe may be rising up the ranks and hoping soon to perform on the world stage, but Tommy has never forgotten his roots. Always referencing his Bideford upbringing in any national interview, Tommy was recently awarded the town shield for his achievements. Denise Austin \nBeach volleyball is among the coolest sports in the Olympics and North Devon can boast one of its finest exponents. \nDescribed as a pioneer in UK beach volleyball, Denise began her career 30 years ago when she won a South West Pro Tour event in Croyde. \nHaving been desperately close to qualifying for the 2000 and 2004 Olympics, her goal now is to coach the best young players to the very top of the game. George Friend \nIs there a cooler man in English football – let alone North Devon – than Chittlehampton's very own George Friend? \nKnown by many as 'Gorgeous George' and one of football's nice guys, the Middlesbrough left back organised a topless calendar including himself and his Boro teammates to raise money for the unemployed Teesside steelworkers in 2015. \nNot to forget his upbringing, Friend has often returned to help young footballers in South Molton and show there is a side away from the glitz and glamour of the Premier League. Lucy Campbell \nSome surfers have the glamour but not the skills, others have the skills but not the glamour – Woolacombe wonderwoman Lucy enjoys the best of both worlds. \nThe 21-year-old has been a British champion and competes in the World Surf League. \nAlso, for the past two winters, she has been hanging out in surfing hotspots like Indonesia, the Canary Islands, Costa Rica and South Africa promoting brands including Animal and Sun God. Dom Greensmith \nReef are a cool band - meaning their members are also cool, which gives Barnstaple boy Dom Greensmith (their drummer) an automatic pass on our list. \nMany will also know his father who was a well-known primary school teacher in the area for many years. Flaviu The Lynx \nFlaviu made national headlines after his daring escape from Dartmoor Zoo. \nHe managed to spend three weeks on the run, evading helicopters, drones, and traps, before eventually only being caught as he returned to the scene of one of his kills. \nAnd as a result of his jailbreak, the frisky lynx has ended up with a new girlfriend because he is still \"feisty\" from his time in the wild. The Overton Twins \nThey're strapping 6ft 5in lads in their early 20s, can hit the ball for miles, bowl like lightning and it's almost impossible to tell them apart – cricketers don't come much cooler than Craig and Jamie Overton. \nRegulars in the Somerset team, they also travel the world with the England Lions and it's surely only a matter of time before they are playing Test-match cricket. Georgia Toffolo \nTorquay's own Made in Chelsea star lives quite the rock and roll lifestyle. Not only content with starring on the hit E4 show which involves going to a lot of brunches and parties. \nShe hit the headlines when she upset her Torquay mum when she had one too many drinks over Christmas...and woke up in the wrong house – and previously had drunk tweeted the Prime Minister to offer her advice on Brexit negotiations. \nThe 22-year-old was also one of the select few who appeared in front of millions of viewers during The X Factor Final , but still has a lot of love for her mum, as she threw her the 'party of the year' for her 50th birthday. Rinus Van de Sande \nArt and eccentricity are both cool - and Rinus boasts both by the bucket load. \nAs the owner and chef at Broomhill Art Hotel in North Devon, Rinus is responsible for both the amazing quality of installation art on display AND the incredible food offered in their restaurant. \nOne word - cool. Garry Monk \nLeeds United manager Monk began his football career with Torquay United and his family still live in the resort. \nTipped in some quarters to be a future manager of England, or even Wales, Monk was unlucky to be sacked by Swansea and is currently guiding Leeds towards the Championship play-offs. Damon Albarn \nIf you remember the 90's, then you remember BritPop taking over the world. And it was spearheaded by Blur, whose lead singer Damon Albarn has owned a property in Hallsands for the last 16 years. \nDamon is also the co-founder, vocalist, instrumentalist and principal songwriter of the virtual band Gorillaz , has been named the fourth-greatest frontman of all time, is a fervent anti-war campaigner, and even named his first born child after hip-hop legend Missy Elliott. Serge Pizzorno \nThe Kasabian frontman just exudes coolness. A close friend of Noel Fielding and an admirer of Noel Gallagher, the Leicester City supporting rockstar ticks all the boxes. \nHe even dreamt of being a professional footballer and was named man of the match in the 2012 Soccer Aid charity match after lobbing David Seaman. \nAnd he was even born in Devon. Despite being brought up in Leicester, he was born at Newton Abbot Hospital, as 'his mother liked the hospital' Emrhys Cooper \nSouth Devon film star Emrhys Cooper recently became the first western actor to appear in a Bhutanese film. \nHollywood actor Emrhys, who grew up in Littlehempston, has also played the lead role in a worldwide TV drama alongside former Bond girl Denise Richards, who is one of 'the hottest 100 women of all time', - a woman he admitted to have a teenage crush on. \nEmrhys is also passionate about protecting wildlife and creating a healthy planet with WWF and Greenpeace . Cooper shares his home with three rescued cats and an African grey parrot. Ben Howard \nFOLK musician Ben Howard has topped the album charts, won two Brit awards, and has also been unveiled as the star of the Totnes Pound's new £10 note. \nThe surfer/singer/songwriter, who is a Torquay Boys Grammar School old boy, moved to Totnes at the age of eight. \nHe easily picked up the drums and contrabass, but after some time he decided to focus on the guitar. After attending King Edward VI Community Collegeand Torquay Boys' Grammar Schoolhe began studying Journalism at University College Falmouth Charlie Courtenay \nThe Earl of Devon lives in a castle, is a childhood friend of Chris Martin, and is married to a Baywatch actress. \nCharlie Courtenay, the 19th Earl of Devon, and Coldplay singer Chris Martin were pals at an early age and went to the same pre-school in Exeter. \nHe spent 10 years living and working in California as a barrister before moving back to England in 2014 with wife, the former Baywatch actress Allison Langer, and their two children Joscelyn and Jack. \nHe helped bring Radio 1's Big Weekend to the area in 2016, and has opened up the castle ground for pop concerts, including dance festival Lockdown. Mitch Tonks \nMitch has become one of the most respected and knowledgeable seafood people in the country and an acclaimed restaurateur, chef and author in the process. \nHis Seahorse restaurant has won the Observer 's 'Best UK Restaurant' gong; his Rockfish takeaway restaurant chain has twice claimed 'Best Independent Restaurant' at the National Fish & Chip Awards.

Sgt Harry Tangye \nDevon and Cornwall police's traffic officer Sergeant Harry Tangye managed to enrage the Mail Online by posting a selfie on Twitter while police negotiated with a 25-year-old woman on an M5 motorway bridge for three hours. \nThe cop, who has fully embraced social media, also periscoped live from the scene of an RTC and fielded question from as far afield as California. \nHe was named best tweeting police Sergeant two years in a row and was shown that social media can be the new neighbourhood policing Josh Widdicombe \nJournalist-turned-comic Josh grew up in Haytor Vale near Widecombe-in-the-Moorand attended South Dartmoor Community College. \nHis flourishing television career has seen Josh, who grew up in Widecombe-in-the-Moor, co-present the award-winning Channel 4 programme, The Last Leg, one of the most popular comedy shows on television. \nHe has also made appearances on Mock the Week, QI, Live at the Apollo, Have I Got News For You and the Jonathan Ross Show. \nIn addition, he has written and starred in his own sitcom, 'JOSH', which was broadcast on BBC3 last year, with a second series coming this autumn. Lionel Digby \nMusic promoter Lionel Digby brought many famous faces such as The Beetles and David Bowie to the Bay over the years. \nLionel is planning a book on the history of rock music in Torbay, and also was behind the successful Torbay Costume Hire company which contained his lifetime's specialist collection of film, stage and military costumes Peter Cook \nComedian and writer Peter Cook was dubbed 'the funniest man who ever drew breath'. \nCook was born in Torquay in November, 1937, and became involved in comedy while at Cambridge University. \nApart from his television career, he appeared in numerous films and was a financial backer of the satirical magazine Private Eye. \nA proud supporter of Torquay United, he was once chairman of the club's junior supporters' club and once told reporters at a crisis meeting over the future of Private Eye that he was far more concerned with how the Gulls would fare in their match the following day. \nHis friend and fellow comedy actor Stephen Fry described him as the funniest man who ever drew breath and, in 2005, a poll of 300 of his peers ranked him as the number one Comedian's Comedian. Seth Lakeman \nFolk singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Seth comes from a rather talented family - all of whom hail from the village of Buckland Monochorum in West Devon. \nHe began playing music with his parents and two brothers - Sean and Sam - from a young age and hasn't looked back since. \nAt last count he had featured on more than 15 albums, been nominated for a Mercury Music Award and performed with the likes of Jenna Witts (also in this list), Billy Bragg and Jools Holland.

Thom Yorke \nBelieve it or not, the Radiohead lead singer went to university in Exeter. \nHaving sold over 30 million records, it's fair to say Radiohead are fairly influential in the music world - despite their often-depressing lyrics. \nOne of the biggest Devon music rumours that goes around is that Yorke wrote their most famous song, Creep, whilst in the Exeter Lemon Grove toilets. Matthew Goode \nThis Exeter-born actor has made a real name for himself in recent years. \nNot only has he starred in successful films including The Imitation Game and Ricky Gervais' Cemetery Junction, but he has also enjoyed a major role in the acting holy grail that is Downton Abbey - playing Lady Mary's squeeze Henry Talbot. Verity \nThe first lady of Devon, standing proud at 20.25 metres on Ilfracombe pier, sword in hand and glaring out to sea (or Wales) - how could we miss her out of the list? \nShe's huge, heavy, beautiful, grotesque, thought-provoking, opinion-dividing, awe-inspiring and arguably one of THE single biggest draws to North Devon. \nNow that's cool! \nDid we miss someone out?
