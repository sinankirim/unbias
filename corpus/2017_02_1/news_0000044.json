Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA damning report has condemned the Government’s failure to act after thousands of farmers were forced to wait for delayed subsidy payments. \nThe lack of action raises questions about whether Whitehall will be able to support farmers following Brexit , said the Committee of Public Accounts. \nThe Committee, including Northumberland MP Anne-Marie Trevelyan , said only 38% of farmers, a little more than a third, received payments when they were due in December last year. \nThis had risen to three quarters by the end of January, but there were still 14,300 farmers, 16% of the total, who had not received any payment by the end of March. \nAnd more than 10,000 farmers who had received a payment had not been paid in full. \nThe conclusion comes in a new report examining delivery of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), the European framework of subsidies and rural development programmes. Conservative MP for Berwick Anne-Marie Trevelyan \nThe National Farmers Union (NFU) last year warned that late payments had caused shocking levels of hardship among some farmers. \nSo called ‘commoners’, individuals with recognised rights to carry out farming practices on designated common land, were hard hit in Yorkshire and the North East, according to the NFU. \nThe Rural Payments Agency (RPA), an agency of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, pays out £1.8 billion a year in CAP payments to English farmers and landowners. \nBut MPs said the Department must improve its understanding of the impact delayed payments have on farmers and the wider rural community, says the Committee, and in particular learn lessons from the floods of 2015 “to ensure payments to farmers in times of crisis are not delayed”. \nAnd they said in their report: “The Department’s record of failure when developing systems to support subsidy payments to farmers does not inspire confidence in its ability to cope with the challenges associated with Brexit that lie ahead.” Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T07:20:31.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
