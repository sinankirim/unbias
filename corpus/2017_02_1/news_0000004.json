Could   \nMPs launched a last ditch bid to ensure English regions are consulted during the Government’s Brexit negotiations with the European Union. \nThe House of Commons has begun discussing amendments to the historic legislation allowing Prime Minister Theresa May to trigger Article 50, which begins the process of leaving the European Union. \nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn has submitted a series of proposals, as have backbench MPs from all parties. \nBut the Government has been unwilling to accept any changes to the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill, which simply allows Brexit to begin without imposing any conditions on the Government. \nNorth East MPs including Catherine McKinnell , Labour MP for Newcastle North, Phil Wilson, Labour MP for Sedgfield, and Julie Elliott, Labour MP for Sunderland Central, sponsored an amendment demanding that the Government “set out a strategy for consultation with representatives of the English regions, including those without directly elected Mayors”, before triggering Article 50. MPs Catherine McKinnell, Phil Wilson and Julie Elliott \nA separate amendment, sponsored by London MP Seema Malhotra, calls on the Prime Minister to establish a National Convention on Exiting the European Union, which would include elected English mayors, representatives of local councils, university leaders and representatives of the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish administrations. \nMeanwhile, an official Labour amendment backed by party leader Jeremy Corbyn calls on the Government to consult a committee made up of the leaders of the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments before signing any agreements with the European Union. The SNP also sponsored a similar motion. \nMrs May has already pledged that the devolved administrations in the nations outside England will be consulted. \nBut asked whether the PM was minded to accept any of the tabled amendments, her official spokeswoman said: “We’ve been very clear, we think this should be a straightforward bill about giving the Government the power to deliver on the decision of the British people.” \nAnd Mrs May warned pro-Remain Tories against backing amendments seeking to ensure Parliament gets a say on the “endgame” if Brexit negotiations collapse without a deal.
