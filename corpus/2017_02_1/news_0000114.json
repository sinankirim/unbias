But the initial vote was followed by discussion of a series of amendments, which were all rejected. MP Chi Onwurah \nMs Onwurah said: “We had a week’s debate and no amendments were accepted. That included amendments about protecting the NHS, staying in the single market, protecting our economic and social model so we don’t become a off-shore Trump-style tax haven. \n“Once they were rejected, it was clear May’s Brexit is a Tory Brexit and I couldn’t vote for that. We know that what the Tories do when they get the chance is undermine jobs and livelihoods in the North East, and their Brexit will be no different.” \nThe MP is a shadow business minister. \nIt is unclear whether she will be allowed to continue in this role after disobeying a “three line whip”, strict orders from the party leader to vote for the legislation. Catherine McKinnell \nNewcastle North MP Catherine McKinnell also voted against the Bill. She said that she would now continue to push the Government to consult English regions including the North East as Brexit negotiations take place. \nThe Bill will now go to the House of Lords to be debated. \nOne former Minister, Conservative MP Oliver Letwin, said that the Lords could be abolished if it tries to block Brexit. \nSpeaking in the Commons, he asked a Government Minister if there would be a chance to debate “the possibility of either the abolition or full scale reform of the Lords” if they attempted to prevent Mrs May triggering Article 50 by the end of March as planned. EU and Union flags (Photo: PA) \nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn faces criticism after ordering his MPs to vote in favour of the Brexit Bill. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon called him “utterly pathetic” and accused Labour of handing the Prime Minister a “blank cheque” over Brexit. \nBut many Labour politicians argue the party had to accept the result of last year’s EU referendum, when the public voted to leave the EU. Read More \nMr Corbyn said: “Labour has demonstrated that we respect the result of the referendum by voting to begin negotiations to leave the EU, with the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs supporting our party’s position. \n“In recent weeks, Labour has forced the government to reveal what their plan for Brexit actually is. Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn \n“Both from their public statements and the amendments their MPs have voted down, the Conservatives have made clear they are determined to use Brexit to turn Britain into a bargain basement tax haven. \n“Labour has a profoundly different vision for our country, with a plan to rebuild and transform Britain so that no one and no community is left behind. \n“Article 50 is just the start of the negotiating process. Labour will be using every opportunity, both in Parliament and in the country, to protect jobs, rights and living standards, and achieve the best possible deal for Britain.” \nItaly’s Prime Minister said Brexit negotiations “will not be easy” but the process must not become “destructive”, after he met Mrs May in 10 Downing Street.

We recognise people want reassurance for their future.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T23:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T19:16:12.597+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
