Although the figure of 151,687 is a reduction in the 2015 figure it represents a 70 per cent increase in registrations compared to levels seen at the time of the housing crash in 2008/09. \nThese new figures do not, however, meet the current need for new housing though.Former housing minister Brandon Lewis MP said in 2015 that the Government had a target to build one million new homes by 2020, yet just 115,689 new homes were registered in the private sector last year, compared to 117,506 in 2015.That leaves a shortfall for 2016 alone of at least 80,000. Should this level of construction continue, by 2020 the Government will be around 250,000 homes short of it's target.In terms of house types, 2016 saw the highest number of detached homes registered in the UK since 2004, with a total of 46,118 being registered and the highest number of semi-detached since records began 30 years ago (38,999).As the leading warranty and insurance provider for new homes in the UK, NHBC's registration statistics are a lead indicator of the country's new homes market. \nCommenting on the annual statistics, NHBC Business Development Director Mark Jones said: \"Taking into account the extraordinary events of 2016, the UK house-building sector has remained resilient, despite initial caution around Brexit.\"We have also seen some strong regional growth outside of London.\"Both industry and consumer confidence remains high and early signs indicate that the new year has begun positively.\" Property Search ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T17:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T15:38:37.233+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
