It is very disappointing that the club has not afforded him the same courtesy.\" Read More: Interim boss Craig Shakespeare insists there is no player revolt \nAs of 11am on Saturday, 14 people had signed the petition. \nAmong the fans signing was Liz Yeates, who wrote: \"We can stop making stupid mistakes and it is important that we do. Have brexit and Trump not taught us anything about decision making?\" \nClick here to sign Adham's petition. \nAnother fan, Scott Johnson, has started a Change.org petition to thank Ranieri for leading Leicester to glory. \nThe petition, which had 52 supporters within 24 hours of starting, states: \"After the sacking of Claudio Ranieri, we the fans would like to show our everlasting appreciation for bringing the Premier League title to the club in 2016. \n\"An unbelievable achievement which should be recognised and immortalised.\" \nAmong those signing it was Kerry Evans, who commented: \"I am now 53 years old and have been a season ticket holder since I was six years old. This man gave me my dream. Simply a legend.\" \nAdrian Macleod added: \"Disgraceful from the owners, the bloke is a legend.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T15:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T11:59:05.373+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
