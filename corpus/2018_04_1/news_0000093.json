A total of 3,962 staff from the European Economic Area left the NMC register between 2017 and 2018. That is 28% more than in 2016/17 and three times higher than the number who left in 2013/14. Just 805 nurses moved in the other direction and joined the register last year. Ben Bradshaw after increasing his majority in May\nThe Chief Executive of the Royal College of Nursing, Janet Davies, said: “It feels that efforts to boost the number of nurses are being dragged down by a botched Brexit.”\nBrexit was cited as a key reason EU staff were leaving in interviews the NMC conducted with them. The fall in the value of the pound since the Referendum was another.\n“Nurses returning home, or giving Britain a miss entirely, are doing so because their rights are not clear enough,” Ms Davies said.\nThis worrying news came the day after the head of the NHS, Simon Stevens, issued a stark warning about the state of social care and the impact it is having on the NHS. He told our committee, which is in the middle of an inquiry into the long-term funding of social care, that the difficulty in finding the right support for people when they are ready to leave hospital is putting unprecedented strain on the system.\n“Of the 100,000 hospital beds across England, about 18,000 are occupied by people who have been stuck in hospital more than 21 days,” he said. “A lot of that is attributable to problems getting discharged and the social care support that people need. That is the equivalent of 36 of our acute hospitals out of action.” Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw\nThis situation is having a serious knock on effect on waiting times for treatment, as my post bag confirms. A few years ago nearly everyone could be expected to be treated within 18 weeks. Indeed that was written into the NHS Constitution by the last Labour Government as a right.\nBut I have constituents who have now been waiting in pain for an operation for well over a year and the Government has quietly dropped its waiting time targets. The 18 week target, the four hour A & E target and the cancer treatment targets, none of which has been met for the last four years. There are now more than 4 million people in England waiting more than 18 weeks for their operation.\nEcho readers in Exeter have the chance to send the Government a clear message about the pressures on our health and social care services in next week’s local elections.
