Having turned employment as a staffer at 10 Downing Street into a comedy career, he exudes political knowledge but has an innate ability to make people laugh. \nUnspun was nominated for Best Entertainment Programme at the 2017 Broadcast Digital Awards. This week his blog was shortlisted for a comedy award in the British Podcast Awards for his podcast The Political Party. The show has amassed over 1m downloads on Soundcloud, and hit the top spot of the iTunes comedy chart.

The show’s success last year has seen the tour extended through 2018. \nSteve Lodge, who runs Comedy Hall, said this was a rare chance to experience British politics close up. “Matt has knowledge, which is usually dangerous – and to the establishment it certainly is. He has the ability to mock what needs to be mocked at Westminster, and to give his audience an insight into what goes on in the dusty halls and offices of our seat of politics. \n“With the fallout of Brexit, Russian poisoning and Corbyn’s anti-semitic-gate, there will be lots to learn. \nMatt is a popular guest on TV, appearing on The Royal Variety Performance (ITV), Have I Got News For You (BBC One) , Rory Bremner’s Coalition and Election Reports (both BBC Two) , Mock the Week (BBC2 Two) , 8 out of 10 Cats (Channel 4) , Celebrity 15-to-1 (Channel 4), Celebrity Pointless (BBC1), Question Time (BBC One) , This Week (BBC One) and Russell Howard’s Good News (BBC Three) and Channel 4’s Jon Richardson Grows Up. In the lead up to 2017’s snap election, Matt also presented a regular segment on The One Show commenting on the highlights of the campaign trail.
