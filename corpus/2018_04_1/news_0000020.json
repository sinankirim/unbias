White Share Get daily updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing! Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nIt’s less than 12 months until the UK leaves the European Union, a key political shift that will have sweeping changes for farmers across the region. To manage and adjust to the challenges this will bring, and ongoing uncertainty, financial resilience is vital. \nFarmers need to focus on improving productivity, in order to increase future sustainability and, given the expected changes in funding and grants, the farming sector needs to move away from relying on subsidies and prepare for a future with reduced financial support by investing in new technologies, creating new revenue streams through diversification and concentrating on succession planning to ensure the longevity, and security, of their farm. \nHaving in place the right support for your farm business is therefore vital, not only to help you through these uncertain times but also to help maximise the health and profitability of your farm during good times too. \nBeing proactive, and planning ahead, is more important than ever before and a good farm consultant helps farmers to push their business forwards, strategically plan for peaks and troughs all year round, and capitalise on opportunities that would greatly benefit you and your farm, helping to meet your personal and business objectives. \nGeorge F. White is one of the largest farm consultancy teams in the North and we’re currently working with a wide range of farms, large and small, assessing their strengths and weaknesses, reviewing the overall health of the business and proposing solutions to farmers to help them overcome the challenges they face. \nWe understand that each farm is unique, and each farmer receives a bespoke service tailored to their specific needs and requirements. \nWe often hear that consultancy services are for huge farms, or those facing difficulties, but this really isn’t the case. \nWhat’s important is that you and your farm have the right support structure, whatever size or type of farm. What matters is developing a close working relationship with your consultant so that you trust them to advise you appropriately, to help you achieve the best outcomes for you personally and also your business. \nDesk-based consultancy isn’t going to achieve this, which is why our farm team have lots of face to face contact with clients, visiting farms regularly, looking at stock, crops, and machinery and assessing its strengths and challenges to decide where next to take the business, or strategically advise on what it needs at that time, whether that’s preventative measures, business planning and cash flow management, or preparation of funding briefs and farm budgets. \nWe’re not just a fair-weather consultancy either - we offer all year-round support to help you overcome business and financial hurdles, to maximise profitability. \nWe understand it’s often difficult to let an outsider in, which is why establishing a strong, close relationship is vital from the beginning, working together proactively and planning ahead to help you get the farm business to where you want. \nTo discuss our farm consultancy services in more detail, contact Elliot Taylor on elliottaylor@georgefwhite.co.uk Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-21T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-21T03:49:45.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
