A new Brexit survey shows 46% of readers of regional news websites believe Britain will be better off economically inside Europe. The study also found that 51% said Britain should continue to be part of the single European market. A total of 7,000 North East readers voted in our biggest Brexit poll as Britain creeps closer to leaving the EU. And it revealed two thirds of those polled are not happy with how negotiations are going. \nRemain voters are, unsurprisingly, much more likely to think continuing close ties with Europe is a good idea, with 84% saying Britain is better off economically inside Europe and 81% saying we should continue to be part of the Single Market.

Among those who said they voted Leave, 51% are unhappy with the status of negotiations compared to 28% who were happy. More than three-quarters of those who voted Remain (81%) said they were unhappy, compared to 6% who said they were happy. \nHowever, most of those surveyed said they would still stick with how they voted - 84% of Leave voters and 91% of Remain voters. Shadow Minister for infrastructure Lord Adonis (Image: Dave Higgens/PA Wire) Leave voters were more likely to say they would not vote in the same way now, with 7% of leave voters saying they’d vote differently, and 9% who were not sure, while 5% of Remain voters would vote differently, and 6% were unsure. The EU has warned negotiations must finish before the end of October so the other 27 EU states can rubber-stamp any deal. \nMPs will then hold a Parliamentary vote over the terms. Prime Minister Theresa May (Image: PA) Recently, Lord Adonis - a key ‘Remainer’ - said he believed that vote could still derail Brexit. “I think there is every prospect we can stay in Europe,” he told a Newcastle rally. “There will be a parliamentary crisis when Theresa May returns with her treaty from Brussels. “She won’t have a majority for her treaty because the Labour Party will be bound to vote against it as there is no way the Labour Party can support Conservative terms for Brexit which involves less trade and cuts to living standards.” The study, run in partnership with Google Surveys, was completed online by 7,000 people reading North East news websites.
