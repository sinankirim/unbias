Fishermen United Vice Chairman Shane Farrow \nAhead of the protest, a Defra spokeswoman said: “The UK will be a full member state for the negotiations at the December Fisheries Council in 2018. \n“Rules agreed will apply for the whole of 2019. By December 2020 we will be negotiating fishing opportunities for 2021 as a third country and independent coastal state completely outside the Common Fisheries Policy. \n“The agreed text clarifies that the UK’s share of quotas will not change during the implementation period and that the UK can attend international negotiations.

Any attempt by the EU to operate in a way which would harm the fishing industry would breach that obligation. \n“During the implementation period, current access arrangements will continue. The UK will continue to control access to its territorial waters subject to any specific access provided for in current EU rules.” Like us on Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-08T19:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-08T20:21:27.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
