Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email\nOne of the UK’s newest political parties is hoping to make an immediate impact in the North East.\nPro Europe ‘Renew’ was only officially launched in February to stop Brexit and hold a second referendum on the final deal.\nIt has 16 candidates standing at the local elections on May 3 and while the majority are in London, they have two fighting for seats on North Tyneside Council .\nThey are Chartered Surveyor Tom Bailey who is hoping to win the Tynemouth ward and local businessman Alex Jacobs who is standing at Monkseaton South.\nMr Bailey said: “It’s time we pushed back against the politics of fear and mistrust and handed back to local residents some real control over their community.\n“We will ensure decisions are taken at neighbourhood level on issues like traffic, urban development and regeneration. We need to stop throwing money at Brexit and concentrate on what matters to local people.”\nMr Jacobs added: “Renew is a party dedicated to reducing inequality in the UK. For many years the north of England has had a raw deal from successive governments. It’s also clear that younger people in the UK are not being well-served by government policy. Renew wants to change that.” Tom Bailey, left, and Alex Jacobs\nWhile it was formed in London, the first time some of its principal leaders including James Clarke and James Torrance spoke to the public about the party was in the North East.\nIts North East co-ordinator, Judi Sutherland, said it happened after an invite from Durham University.\nShe described it as a ‘centrist’ party, occupying the centre ground “Labour and the Tories had vacated” and was dismissive of the Lib Dems as they are scoring around 8% in the opinion polls despite having “years to get their message across”.
