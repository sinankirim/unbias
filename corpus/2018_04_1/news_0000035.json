Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nDevon for Europe volunteers were out in force in Tiverton for their largest ever pro-European campaign, joining thousands across the country demanding that we are given a People’s Vote on the terms of the proposed agreement to leave the EU once they are known, including the option to Remain. \nBesides Tiverton there were campaigners out in four other towns across Devon for the largest ever pro-European campaign, joining thousands across the country on Saturday, April 14. \nDespite a grey day in the town it did not deter Devon for Europe volunteers, drawn from all over East Devon, campaigning for people to have a vote on the terms on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, including the option to Remain.

In particular, volunteers said it was clear that small, family farmers who are very important to the local community and economy, are regretting the referendum outcome as their futures look ever more precarious. \nLead volunteer, Anthea Simmons said: “The mood in Tiverton has begun to change from indifference and acceptance of the result to anger and frustration at the damage Brexit will inflict and the degree to which people feel misled. Whilst there was gratitude for the hope our efforts bring, there was also some despair as to whether this government will listen or play fair.” \nOne woman is said to have said “They are all liars, aren’t they? We don’t like liars.” Whilst another cited the action in Syria overnight as evidence that this government does as it pleases and takes no notice of the people. \nPerhaps the most poignant comment was said to have come from 9 year old Antonia, who said “Brexit is the thing we don’t like, isn’t it? I don’t like it because my Mummy is German and my Oma lives in Hamburg.” Read More Learn how to fly with the Devon and Somerset Gliding Club this weekend \nIn addition to sign-ups to the campaign for a people’s vote, those in Tiverton addressed more than sixty postcards with anti-Brexit messages to MPs including Neil Parish, Mel Stride and Geoffrey Cox. These are being mailed by a Devon for Europe volunteer and will hit their desks this week, reinforcing the message that the mood on the streets is changing fast. \nOther stalls in Devon on Saturday were held in Exmouth, Okehampton, Barnstaple and Plymouth. \nSimon Chater, lead organiser for Street Stalls for Devon for Europe, said: “I’m absolutely delighted that we have had such a large number of stalls today, the largest number on one day we’ve ever had and the largest number of new supporters signed up, apart from the very successful march and rally a few weeks ago in Exeter. It was a fantastic effort by all involved and I think it's particularly encouraging to see so many new local volunteers coming along to the stalls. By holding these street stalls, we are able let people know that Brexit is not a done deal and that we believe that the people should decide if any deal is good enough.” Read More Bus users group slam latest news on Exeter Bus Station closure \nAlex Pilkington, Chair of Devon for Europe added: “The Government’s own figures indicate we will be worse off in any scenario if we leave the EU. All the promises by Leave are being quietly buried, including that of £350 million a week for the NHS. It is vital that the NHS is financed and staffed and leaving the EU will make both things more difficult. With Brexit turning out to be much more complicated and costly than the people were told during the referendum, we are demanding a People’s Vote on the final Brexit deal, with the option to Remain.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-23T20:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T20:16:47.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
