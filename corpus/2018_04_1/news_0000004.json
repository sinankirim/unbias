Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nProfits at a Leicester business bank have grown by a third on the back of rising deposits and lending as well as “high customer satisfaction”. \nCambridge and Counties, which is based in New Walk , saw pre-tax profits rise 35 per cent to £24.4 million in 2017, compared to £18.1 million a year earlier. \nDeposits for the year were £798 million – 17 per cent up on the £685 million figure for 2016 – while lending balances were also up 17 per cent at £690 million. \nTotal assets stood at £879 million, compared to £746 million in 2016. \nThe niche bank was set up to support small and medium sized businesses when traditional banks cut back following the credit crunch. \nChief executive Mike Kirsopp said the business predicted further growth for 2018, but believed the full implications of Brexit were unlikely to be known for at least four years. \nHe said: “We have created a unique proposition in the niche markets we operate in that is based around elevated levels of personalised service combined with the speed, efficiency and know-how that is needed in today’s modern world. \n“We enjoyed another year of impressive growth in 2017, and although there are clearly risks in the marketplace, we remain optimistic for the future. \n“In terms of Brexit, the full effect of this will not be known for around four years, but in the meantime, we haven’t seen any significant impact on our markets or business.” \nBank chairman Simon Moore said: “The fact we have maintained such high customer satisfaction levels during our strong growth is testament to the strength of our team and systems. \n“However, we are not resting on our laurels. \n“We will make further investment in our customer experience technology, and will continue to look at ways we can enhance our existing product range and potentially launch into new markets.” Read More \nDespite being headquartered in Leicester, the business is jointly owned by Trinity Hall of Cambridge University and Cambridgeshire Local Government Pension Fund.
