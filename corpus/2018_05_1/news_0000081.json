Climate change is having an impact: records show that average monthly rainfall has increased by 15 per cent in comparison to the 1960-1990 climatic baseline. Chief Executive Kevin Bishop has met with Central Devon MP Mel Stride\n\"We need greater support if we are to ensure Dartmoor remains fully accessible for two million visitors to the national park each year who play a huge role in supporting the region’s economy.”\n“We are also keen to work with the farming and landowning community to develop a new approach to farm support and rural development post Brexit. Farming Futures is an existing pilot in partnership with the Dartmoor Commoners, Duchy of Cornwall, Natural England, RSPB and South West Water with farmers designing the management to deliver a range of public benefits – improved biodiversity, protection of archaeology, public access etc.\n“There is an opportunity to extend this pilot to demonstrate how the Government’s vision of an enhanced environment, high quality food production and vibrant rural communities can be delivered at a local level.” Mel Stride\nMr Stride added: “I am very happy to lobby DEFRA ministers to see whether they can support the Rural Productivity Network proposals and whether the department can help with the cost of repairs to paths, walls, drainage ditches and hedge banks due to the weather we experienced.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": ["https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/devonlive/subscriptions/&quot;}"], "published": "2018-05-25T18:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T20:11:24.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
