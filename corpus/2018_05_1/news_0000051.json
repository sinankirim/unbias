Fleur and Ferit Ozdemir (Image: Newcastle Journal)\nHis Grainger Market cafe, ‘Fez Food’ became an instant hit with foodies after opening three years ago.\nOn that success, he’s lodged plans to open a second on the ‘biker’ stretch of Westgate Road.\nBut life wasn’t always this easy for Ferit, who had to overcome huge hurdles to live on Tyneside.\n“Turkey isn’t in the European Union. Even though I was married to a UK citizen I had to apply for a visa and pass an English test,” he recalled.\n“The visa was about £1,000.\n“My wife had to earn over £18,200 and prove that she could support me if I didn’t get a job because I would never be allowed any benefits.

So another £1,000 and this time the life in the UK test.\n“This process is being made stricter and harder, so yes I do worry as it separates families.”\nFor Ferit, that’s a fear he knows too well.\n“As I child in Turkey I was homeless and lived on the street with my younger brother for a time, so being together as a family is very important to me,” he adds.
