If the paper business – which has since been divested – is excluded from the figures, turnover rose by 4% and adjusted operating profits were up 7% to £56.9m.\nMr Sutherland highlighted the strength of the firm’s underlying results and its order book. Divesting the paper business has also helped the company achieve its strongest balance sheet for years with net debt reduced by £71m to £49.9m, he said.

A significant reduction in the profitability of the paper business was the major factor causing the profit decline, with the write off of the UK passport bid costs as well as planned investments in R&D and sales being offset in part by additional margin from increased sales and certain provision and accrual releases, where we now have additional information as to the likelihood and amount of potential liabilities.” Read More Avid Technology strikes deal with Jaguar Land Rover in £20m R&D project\nIt is not clear yet what will happen to the people who work in the Gateshead passport site.\nAt the time of the contract announcement, Mr Sutherland said the company might try to win other work for the plant.
