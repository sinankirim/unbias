Air pollution is a problem in the Leicester\nThese tiny particles can be breathed into the lungs and get into the bloodstream, causing health problems including heart disease, strokes and lung cancer.\nOfficials say almost two-fifths (38%) of PM2.5 comes from domestic wood burners and open fires, which just 7.5% of homes have.\nThe strategy also aims to tackle another part of the problem, ammonia from farming, by requiring farmers to invest in equipment and measures to reduce emissions from things such as slurry spread on fields.\nUnder the plans, farmers will get support to bring in the equipment through the new system of agricultural payments for delivering public benefits, which is being devised to replace European subsidies after Brexit.
