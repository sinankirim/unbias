They obviously thought they had a chance, they were after the symbolic nature of the seat.” Read More \nHe slammed Theresa May and arrogant but stopped short of throwing his weight behind his party’s leader. \n“It is one thing to campaign and another thing to govern,” he said. \nIn North Durham Kevan Jones kept the seat he has held since 2001 with a comfortable 13,000 majority. \nAttacking Theresa May he said: “Theresa May’s gamble to call this election has completely failed and one other thing shown is the last seven years of austerity, which has damaged not only this constituency but constituencies across the country - has also been rejected.” Grahame Morris (Photo: Newcastle Chronicle) \nThe former pit villages of Easington have been represented by Labour since 1950 and this election was no exception with MP Grahame Morris winning with a 14,892 majority. \nA Corbynite through and through Mr Morris said: “Isn’t it just a lovely feeling when you win and are on a crest of a wave.” \nIn Durham City Labour MP Roberta Blackman-Woods changed her tune on Corbyn after seeing a huge increase in young people engaged in politics during this campaign. \n“I was critical of Jeremy over Brexit but I did go back and support him,” she said. \n“Young people in particular are very taken by Jeremy.” Bishop Auckland Result: Labour HOLD \nHelen Goodman (LAB) 20, 808 \nChristopher Adams (CON) 20,306 \nCiaran Morrissey (LIB DEM) 1,176 \nAdam Walker (BNP) 991 Durham City result: Labour HOLD \nRoberta Blackman-Woods (LAB) 26,772 \nAmanda Hopgood (LIB DEM) 4,787 \nMalcolm Bint (UKIP) 1,116 \nJon Collings (Young People Party) 45 \nJohn Elmer (Green) 797", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-06-09T14:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-06-09T09:33:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
