She even helped make Jeremy Corbyn look like leadership material. \nShe's turned us into the laughing stock of Europe.And worse than that, she has threatened the stability of the whole country. \nHow on earth are we supposed to reassure the world's banks, global manufacturers and other big businesses based here, for instance, that – come our split from the union – that they will be better off based here than in Frankfurt, Paris, or northern Italy? \nThis Government failed to win the mandate it needed for Brexit, for increasing levies on firms employing EU workers, or even for simplifying the tax system. \nIt couldn't have got things more wrong. \nIt would be funny if it wasn't so terrifying. Business leaders must be wondering what bombshell is going to drop next. \nAbout a year ago a Leicestershire accountant told me business has had to get used to living in a semi-permanent state of uncertainty. \nOne's thing's for certain, Theresa May must go.
