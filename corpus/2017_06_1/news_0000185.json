Data roaming \nMost will welcome changes in the way mobile operators charge for using phones overseas - and from June 15 2017, roaming charges will be abolished within the EU. \nThe price comparison site uSwitch says: \"This means you can use your regular allowance of calls, texts and data for no extra cost from anywhere in the European Union. \n\"So, if you want to check your work emails or give all your followers holiday envy by posting sunny selfies on Facebook, you won't have to pay any more than you would at home. \n\"You'll also be able to call or text anyone in the EU from anywhere else in the EU at your normal UK rate.\" \nRead more: The top 5 places to get fish and chips in Leicestershire \nBut it's not all good news - because Brexit could change everything. \nWhen the UK formally leaves the EU, it's perfectly possible that the existing caps on roaming charges will no longer apply. \nThe result is that Britons could end up paying much more for roaming again - and there are still plans to add VAT to roaming charges outside the UK. \nMoneySavingExpert,com warns not to get too excited about the roaming ban on June 15. \nThey said: \"It's emerged in the small print that many who have unlimited or competitively priced data allowances CAN still be charged extra roaming fees above a certain level of usage. \n\"And analysis by MoneySavingExpert.com shows it's those on cheaper mobile deals who are most likely to be affected.\" Money laundering \nThere are also changes to make money laundering harder, with the idea to improve the current regulations which are 10 years old. \nCompanies will be expected to carry out extra due diligence on its financial systems to prevent terrorist funding, including e-money and pre-paid cards. \nAnd for the first time all gambling providers, not just casinos, will be subject to the regulations. \nBut the new rules will not apply to people engaging in financial activity on a very occasional basis with a turnover of under Â£100,000. \nRead more: German Doner Kebab chain is set to open a new branch in Leicester \n\"Suddenly there is a sense of urgency around the UK's implementation of the fourth Money Laundering Directive,\" says the website for financial experts Bond Dickinson. \n\"Time is now running short, and the legislation must be in force by June 26. All businesses covered by the regulations will need to make changes to their procedures, systems and controls to comply with the requirement.\" Cricket laws \nThe first new Code of the Laws of Cricket since 2000 will take effect around the world from October 1. \nA major change is in the use of words, with the 42 laws now written in non-gender phrases - although the term \"batsman\" is still allowed. \nA new law will allow bails to be tethered to stumps in a bid to prevent injury, and limits will be placed on the thickness of the edges and overall depth of bats. \nOther changes include a new law of the game addressing players' conduct and giving an in-match consequence for poor on-field behaviour. \nThe MCC, which regulates the game, said: \"This is a new law that deals specifically with players' misconduct and is introduced following widespread consultation, surveys with players and umpires and a series of trials of the different levels of sanctions. \n\"It is widely accepted that there is a need both to provide the umpires with appropriate on-field sanctions to deal with deteriorating levels of behaviour, not just to report such matters, and that there should be different levels of sanction leading to sending off for acts of violence.\" \nSanctions will include the giving of extra points to opponents.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-06-03T15:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-06-03T11:04:54.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
