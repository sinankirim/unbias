Theresa May said the three million EU citizens in Britain will have to apply for 'settled status' to stay living here after we leave the EU, which will likely happen in 2019. \n'Settled status' will mean they will be allowed to carry on living in Britain indefinitely after we leave the EU. Some 195,000 EU nationals are living in the South West, according to the latest government figures. \nAbout half of the total - some 98,000 people - are from the so-called 'EU14', which roughly corresponds to the EU countries in western Europe and Scandinavia such as France, Germany and Sweden. Another 76,000 are from the countries in central Europe such as Poland and Slovakia that joined the EU in 2004. \nA further 14,000 are from Romania and Bulgaria and 7,000 from Malta, Cyprus or Croatia. The overall number of European citizens living in the South West has risen from 168,000 in 2010. \nAt some point the Government will declare a 'specified date' after which EU nationals won't be almost guaranteed the right to stay. This will be set as sometime between March 2017, when we notified Brussels of our intention to withdraw from the EU, and the date we actually leave. \nEffectively any EU citizens living in Britain before this date will be able to apply for settled status. The latest figures - which reflect the situation in 2015 - include people of all ages.
