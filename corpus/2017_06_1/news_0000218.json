Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nLabour are celebrating in North Tyneside after the party kept its hold on the borough with comfortable wins. \nAlan Campbell, who has been Tynemouth MP for 20 years, was declared winner once again with 32,395 votes, while Mary Glindon kept her North Tyneside seat with 33,456 votes. \nLoud cheers and applause rang through the counting hall after the results were announced at the Parks Leisure Centre in North Shields. \nMr Campbell said: “I’m absolutely over the moon, especially after increasing the majority here and having seen off a very serious threat from the Conservative Party. \n“We fought a very hard local campaign and my record on important issues was what mattered for local people, including regeneration, health and education. \n“The Conservative party’s campaign on Brexit simply failed to take off.” Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now \nConservative Nick Varley was in second place in Tynemouth with 20,729 votes, Liberal Democrat candidate John Appleby received 1,724, UKIP’s Stuart Houghton had 1,257, Julia Erskine for the Green party scored 629 and independent candidate Anthony Jull ‘The Durham Cobbler’ had 124. \nIn the North Tyneside constituency, Conservative Henry Newman bagged 14,172 votes, UKIP’s Gary Legg had 2,101, Martin Collins for the Green Party had 669 and Liberal Democrat Greg Stone received 1,494. Mary Glindon (left) and Alan Campbell (right) \nLabour’s Mary Glindon said: “This is absolutely brilliant. We fought in North Tyneside on issues that matter to people here, it wasn’t all about Brexit. They were worried about the NHS and education. \n“This is a victory for ordinary people.” \nMr Stone said North Tyneside had always been a safe Labour seat and he did not expect to win. However, he said there was a prospect of a hung parliament and the possibility of another general election. \nIn the event of a hung parliament, he added: “We would be very reluctant to enter into a coalition after our previous experience. There could be another election in the not too distant future.” \nTurnout for Tynemouth was 74.48% (56,964 votes) and North Tyneside was 66.77% (51,984).
