There is no other way to describe the marketplace in which Newcastle United are attempting to work within. \nYou need only look at the fees being spent: £30million on Jordan Pickford , £20m on Nathan Ake, £17m on Harry Maguire. \nThere have been are a whole host of inflationary pressures on the market over the past two years. These range from the astronomical fees being paid by Chinese clubs to lure top European players to East Asia, as well as the latest top-flight TV deal. \nClubs such as AFC Bournemouth, Watford and Burnley are willing to invest significantly in their squads this summer due to the more-than-£100m payouts they are receiving annually from the Premier League. \nBut there is another significant factor which has driven the cost of European imports up further: the Brexit effect. Read More \nOn Wednesday, June 22 - the day immediately before the European Union referendum took place - £1 was worth €1.30. \nFast-forward little more than 12 months, and £1 is worth just €1.13. \nIn real terms, that means that the pound in your pocket is worth 14 per cent less on the Continent than it was little more than a year ago. \nThat may not appear to be a huge change, but it certainly is when you are attempting to do multi-million-pound transactions with European clubs. \nPaul Pogba’s world-record €100m transfer from Juventus to Manchester United, for example, would have cost the Red Devils £76m before the Brexit vote. Man United actually forked out £89m; as a result of sterling’s value collapsing, the Red Devils were forced to pay an additional £13m to bring the French midfielder back to Old Trafford.

Little more than 12 months ago, it would have cost Newcastle £7.6m to activate it. They will need to pay around £8.8m in order to lure the centre-back to Tyneside in the coming weeks. \nAgain that £1.2m increase may not seem significant, but multiply that over five transfers costing roughly the same and suddenly that is an additional £6m - or potentially even the cost of another player - which has been spent.
