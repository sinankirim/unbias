Not knowing what's included could lead to some surprising charges on your next bill.\" \nEuropean Commissioner Gunther Oettinger has said the agreement showed the EU could deliver tangible results to improve the daily life of Europeans, adding that \"roaming charges will be soon old memories\". \nRead more: Leicester set for mini heat-wave this week \nErnest Doku, mobiles spokesman at uSwitch.com , said any attempt to re-introduce the charges if the UK lost participation in the policy post Brexit would \"a bitter pill for consumers to swallow\". \n\"For those providers looking to step up and stand out, they'd do well to look at how free EU roaming could be maintained. \n\"Teamed with a strategic push into non-EU destinations and a concerted effort to make roaming more affordable regardless of destination, this would serve as a seriously competitive move in an industry where differentiation is key.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-06-13T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-06-13T15:57:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
