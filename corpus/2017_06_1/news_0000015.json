Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nBusiness groups are raising the pressure on the Government to change its approach to Brexit in the light of last week’s unexpected election result. \nEmployers’ organisations EEF and the CBI have seized upon the electoral setback for Theresa May to say that Ministers need to “change tack” from their plans to leave the European single market. \nA Journal survey of North East business leaders carried out before the election found high levels of opposition to a ‘hard Brexit’, with access to both European markets and skilled labour from abroad the areas of highest concern among those completing the survey. \nOpponents of a hard Brexit have now seized on last Thursday’s election result - where Mrs May’s plea to give her a stronger mandate to negotiate with European leaders backfired spectacularly - to argue for a Brexit policy that would protect UK jobs. Carolyn Fairbairn (Photo: PA) \nCarolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), said: “With negotiations almost upon us, British business does not believe that we are where we need to be. \n“The likelihood of a good deal for the UK is further away with every exchange across the Channel. That cannot be allowed to continue.” \nMs Fairbairn said growth and jobs depended on the Government keeping Britain an attractive place to do business - and warned that, the less likely a deal becomes, the more investors will take their money elsewhere. \n“There is no question this is already beginning to bite: a gradual drip, drip, drip of lost investment and missed opportunity,” she said. “For the sake of our economy and the prosperity of our regions, it is time change tack.” \nThe prospect of companies taking investment to overseas plants was also raised by Terry Scuoler, chief executive of the manufacturers’ organisation EEF. Terry Scuoler (Photo: EEF) \nHe said: “The new Government’s priorities must radically re-focus Brexit negotiations around trade and close co-operation ensuring a smooth exit from the EU. \n“There are numerous ways of establishing a new relationship with the EU and, given we’ve just wasted a year, the Government needs to move away from its previous rhetoric and start repairing relations with EU partners. \n“This means putting access to the single market and a form of customs union at the heart of a revised strategy. \n“The UK can surely manage who is and who is not in the country by introducing a more effective and robust form of immigration control which maintains the rights of EU citizens and UK citizens across Europe. \n“With less than two years to negotiate a meaningful deal, the Government should commit to a significant period of transition to manage uncertainty for businesses and bolster confidence.” \nYesterday, the Institute of Directors (IoD) said that its first poll of businesses since the General Election had revealed a “dramatic drop” in confidence.
