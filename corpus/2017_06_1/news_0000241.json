Tory candidate Matt Warman took the seat after receiving 27,271 votes. Mr Nuttall also trailed behind Labour’s candidate who received 10,699 votes. \nMr Nuttall announced his resignation during a press conference this morning. However, he said that UKIP could come back from its defeat stronger than ever .

I am standing down today as the leader of UKIP with immediate effect.

And at the annual conference in Torquay the new rebranded UKIP must be born and a new era must begin with a new leader.” Ukip leader Paul Nuttall speaks during a press conference at Boston West Golf Club where he announced that he is standing down as party leader (Photo: PA) \nHe went on to insist that UKIP was “more relevant than ever” and would play the role in the coming months of the “guard dogs of Brexit”. \nOverall UKIP suffered a devastating defeat during the election. The party saw its votes plummet to 2% of the nation’s total, down from 12.6% under Nigel Farage. \nUntil recently UKIP held one Commons seat, Clacton in Essex, but last night the party lost that seat to Conservative candidate Giles Watling. \nDouglas Carswell won the seat for the Conservative Party in 2015 but later defected to UKIP. In March this year he quit UKIP, but voters found themselves unable to back his replacement Paul Oakley.
