How could we keep our rights? \nThe research, led by Professor Volker Roeben, sets out a legal argument for how rights can continue. \nHe also suggests that the UK could argue for a new category of “associate citizenship” to be created. \nA top priority is reaching agreement on the rights of UK citizens in the EU and vice versa.

Will it happen? \nBoth the UK negotiators and their EU counterparts have both indicated that a top priority is reaching agreement on the rights of UK citizens in the EU, and vice versa. \nHowever, the government has been coy about the type of deal it hopes to negotiate, meaning it is too early to say what — if any — rights people will retain after Brexit.
