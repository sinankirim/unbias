The Unravelling Olympics is the main theme for this General Election The Journal business editor Graeme Whifield muses over politicians and press conference mishaps Share Business Opinion The dominant theme this election appears to be the unravelling of plans. (These are actors at a General Election themed ride at Thorpe Park) (Photo: PA) Share Get business   Thank you for subscribing!   \nGiven that this was supposed to be an election all about Brexit , it’s amazing how quickly a new dominant theme – namely politicians watching their plans unravel around them – has taken over. \nWho would have thought, listening to Dianne Abbott grappling with figures as if asked by a magician to pick a number between one and six billion, that that would be just the start of things. \nFor sheer rabbit-in-headlights dumbness, I would heartily recommend the clip of Michael Fallon on the Channel 4 news on the day that Jeremy Corbyn made a speech about how Britain’s recent foreign policy might have influenced terrorist attacks on the country. \nFallon goes into full-on bombast as he condemns the words being read to him by Channel 4 host Krishnan Guru-Murthy, only to be told that the host is actually quoting Boris Johnson. Gloriously, Fallon at first doesn’t hear and continues his rant, only to come up short when he is told that he is slagging off a fellow Cabinet member. \nCorbyn did his own bit of haplessness on Women’s Hour but by sheer dint of seniority, Theresa May takes the gold medal in the Unravelling Olympics for the press conference when she rowed back on social care plans and demanded, in the face of all logic, that this wasn’t a U-turn. It was like watching the moment a supply teacher loses the plot as an entire class of young scamps hums quietly throughout a lesson. Read More Jeremy Corbyn versus Theresa May - who won the Battle For Number 10? \nIn a sense, this is awful. With Brexit looming and a crisis in our health and social care system, we have never more needed competent politicians. \nTheresa May called the election on the basis that, hey, she might be a bit evil but at least she’s a safe pair of hands. But take the election campaign together with March’s Budget and it’s clear that she shouldn’t be left in charge of a packet of Rice Krispies, never mind the country. \nIt’s slightly tragic too that she almost certainly will win because Labour is staring at open goal and doing its level best to blaze the ball 20 yards wide. \nSo yes: tragic, awful and terrifying. But also funny. \nI don’t wish to play down the awfulness of the political situation in the UK today but if recent events have taught us anything it’s that we gotta laugh. \nWhatever happens next week – and we’ve still gotta vote, no matter how bad the choice – we will probably have a rubbish Government. Let’s make things better ourselves and laugh at what a bunch of chuckleheads they are. \nGraeme Whitfield is business editor of The Journal Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-06-02T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-06-01T20:25:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
