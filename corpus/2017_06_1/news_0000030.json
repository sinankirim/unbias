And why have they joined forces with the Conservative Party? Theresa May has promised to work with the DUP, but who are they and how can they help the Tories? Share Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now Get daily   \nFriday’s shock election result has seen the Conservative Party lose its majority Parliament meaning it can no longer form a government on its own. \nAs the dust settles after an aggressive campaign the Theresa May has now said she will work with the Democratic Unionist Party to form a Government. \nBut who exactly are the DUP? Who are the DUP? \nThe Democratic Unionist Party, or DUP for short, are the based in North Ireland and are now the fifth largest party in Westminster. \nFollowing the election the party has 10 seats in the House of Commons, two more than they held after the 2015 vote. \nThe DUP was formed in 1971 by Ian Paisley and is now the largest political party in Northern Ireland. It is now led by Arlene Foster. \nThe party has traditionally supported Northern Ireland staying in the United Kingdom, unlike republican part Sinn Fein. How popular are they? \nThe DUP is the biggest political party in Northern Ireland. In previous years they have held the majority of seats in the Northern Ireland Assembly, which governs Northern Ireland under devolved powers. \nHowever, the party lost a number of seats during the last Northern Ireland election and has been unable to strike a deal with rival political parties Sinn Fein and SDLP. Unless a deal can be brokered Northern Ireland will be governed under Direct Rule by civil servants. What are the DUP’s policies? \nAs you would expect the DUP’s policies are largely focused on Northern Ireland. One of its main policies in the run up to the election was to reinstate devolved powers for Northern Ireland. \nIn the party’s manifesto it said regaining its devolved powers would allow it to put a Budget in place, help achieve the best Brexit deal for Northern Ireland, and help attract jobs and investment to the region.

This is because the party wants the border with the Irish Republic to be as “frictionless” as possible. \nIn the manifesto Ms Foster said: At this election, we seek a mandate for the Union that really matters - The Union with Great Britain - to make sure Northern Ireland gets the best Brexit deal, to reach an honourable and not a one sided deal to get the Assembly up and running again, and to deal with the real problems that are faced by people in their everyday lives.” Will any of their policies impact the North East? \nIf the DUP is able to negotiate successfully with the Tories there are a number of policies that would impact people across the UK. \nThe DUP is a firm supporter of the National Living Wage and has promised to see further increases in its value. The party has also promised to gradually increase the personal tax allowance. \nThe manifesto also calls for major changes to be made to the TV licence, with the party promising to freeze its cost and then consider abolishing it. They also wish to reform the BBC’s operations. \nReducing energy bills are also high on the DUP’s agenda, and they have promised to put pressure on energy companies to lower prices.
