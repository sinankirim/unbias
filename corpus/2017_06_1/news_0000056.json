Follow our live coverage here. \nMeanwhile Labour has said it will hold Theresa May to her campaign statement that if she lost six or more seats she would no longer be Prime Minister. \nThe declaration from deputy leader Tom Watson came after an exit poll suggested Mrs May is set to lose overall control of the House of Commons after her massive gamble on a snap election backfired. \nThe BBC/Sky/ITV poll suggested the UK is heading for a hung parliament, with Conservatives the largest single party in the House of Commons but 12 seats short of the 326 they need for an absolute majority. \nMr Watson said Mrs May's reputation would \"never recover\" if the figures were borne out in the General Election result, while former chancellor George Osborne said the \"catastrophic\" numbers would throw doubt on her future as Conservative Party leader. \nThe Evening Standard editor, who was sacked from the Cabinet by Mrs May when she took office last July, told ITV: \"Clearly if she's got a worse result than two years ago and is almost unable to form a government then she I doubt will survive in the long term as Conservative party leader.\" \nAnd in his victory speech as he was re-elected MP for West Bromwich East, Mr Watson said: \"Theresa May's authority has been undermined by this election. \n\"She is a damaged Prime Minister whose reputation may never recover.\" \nThe pound plummeted more than 1.5% against the US dollar and 1% against the euro as the shock figures set the scene for political turmoil at Westminster, disruption to upcoming Brexit negotiations and the possibility of a second election later in the year.tion later in the year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-06-09T09:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-06-09T04:10:55.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
