Paul Nuttall, standing down as leader of UKIP. \nIt followed a bruising evening for the party, with Mr Nuttall finishing third in the Boston and Skegness constituency, seeing his party lose more than 11,000 votes from its tally in 2015 , and the proportion of votes cast for UKIP nationally dropping from 12.6 per cent to, at the time of writing, 1.8 per cent. \nThis morning he said the party’s result was ‘disappointing’, but ‘expected’. \nHe said UKIP had become ‘a victim of its own success’, with the UK now on course to leave the European Union. \n“Some mistakenly think our job is done,” he said. Press descended on Boston West Golf Club for the announcement. \nHe argued, however, particularly in light of this morning’s hung parliament, UKIP had a part to play in UK politics, describing the party as the ‘guard dogs of Brexit’. \nHe added, though, it would not be him taking the party forward as leader. \n“I think regardless of the score last night, I have built the foundations for the future in this General Election campaign, but it will be for someone else to build on those. It has been an honour to lead the party I love and the party I helped build over many many years.” \nAnd to those who have supported them, in Boston and Skegness and beyond, his advice was to ‘keep the faith’. \n“UKIP is still here and UKIP is not going away,” he said. “I’m confident my party has a great future.” Sign in", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-06-09T18:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-06-09T15:28:03.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
