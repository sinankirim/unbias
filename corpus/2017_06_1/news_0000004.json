There was a 0.77% swing blue to red. \nHe said: “People are fed up with austerity. They know it’s unnecessary and is austerity to pay for billionaire tax cuts. \n“There’s no need for it anymore. \n“The main priority for Labour is to stop this agenda and get growth back into the economy to help young people who came out in droves get a better and more secure future.” Read More General Election 2017 North East results in full: How North East constituencies voted \nIt was a similar story for Mrs Lewell-Buck in South Shields, who increased her majority to 14,508 after racking up 25,078 votes. It represented a 0.46% swing Conservative to Labour. \nThe South Shields MP, who has faced three elections in four years due to the 2013 by-election, felt “overwhelmed” by the show of support. \nShe added: “Theresa May went into this election thinking it would be all about Brexit. \n“The reality is when you drill down, people care more about bread and butter issues like the economy, schools, health and education - issues the Tories were not providing answers for.” \nJarrow’s turnout was 66.36%, up 6% on 2015, while South Shields’ turnout was 64.26%, up 6.45%.
