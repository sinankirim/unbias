X \nCopy link to paste in your message / Comments (0) \nThe Big Brother house has opened its doors to a host of contestants for its 18th series but some of the faces are familiar. \nDevon aristocrat Arthur Fulford has starred in several reality shows with his father Lord Fulford before entering the most famous house in reality TV. \nBut who is Arthur Fulford? \nFrancis Arthur Fulford is 24-years-old - prior to BB he appeared in two reality shows with his family, The F***ing Fulfords and Life of Toff. \nHis father is Lord Francis Fulford and the family live on the Great Fulford estate in Dunsford. \n\nRead more : Crime czar set to appoint old Tory council colleague as deputy \n\nLast month he flipped his car in a drink-driving related incident after a village cricket match, jumping into and crashing his parent's run-around after having sunk five pints. \nWhen police visited the family home he claimed he had alcohol after the crash, sinking four-fifths of a bottle of wine to deal with the shock. \nHe told them: \"You don't roll a car and not have a drink afterwards.\" \nThe courier, who lives in London, tried to beat the breathalyser by arguing that he was below the limit when he got behind the wheel but magistrates banned him for a year. \nIt took just hours for Arthur to cause a stir in the Big Brother house, after apparently enjoying the welcome beverages a little too much. \nAfter a few glasses, he first began to strip off before jumping into the pool in his boxers, swearing before the watershed. \nHe later tried - and failed - to dress a mannequin in the house in his clothes, as some of the other housemates began to get concerned about his behaviour. \nAlthough others positively encouraged Arthur who went on to break Big Brother's mannequin into bits in the garden. \n\"This is Big Brother, housemates must not dismantle the mannequins,\" Big Brother boomed into the house. \nAs well as getting Big Brother angry, Arthur's antics also didn't impress some of his fellow housemates, including People's Housemate Tom Barber. \nTom, who was voted into the house by viewers, admitted in a Facebook live chat that he was annoyed by Arthur's actions including taking a lot of the booze for himself. \nAnd annoying Tom probably isn't a good thing, with him in charge of this week's nominations. \nTom, who will get to regularly communicate with the public, will have to decide half of the house to exile. \n\nThese housemates will be at risk of eviction in Friday night's next live show. \nWhen is Big Brother on Channel 5? \nBig Brother 18 launched with special live show yesterday, at 8:30pm on Monday June 5, and will be shown nightly on Channel 5. \nOn weeknights, the reality show generally airs at 10pm, lasting for an hour, with spin-off show Big Brother's Bit on the Side following straight after. \nHowever, on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays the fun kicks off at 9.00pm, with the live eviction shows airing on Friday nights. \n\nRead more: Tribute to three 'fantastic young men' who died in A38 van crash \n\nBig Brother typically lasts around two months, with last year's series the shortest in the show's history, lasting just 50 days. \nThis year's show is series expected to run for about the same length of time, though nothing is set in stone yet. \nWho is presenting Big Brother 18? \nEmma Willis returns to her hosting duties for the 18th series of Big Brother, having begun her stint on the show back in 2013. \nThe outrageous Rylan Clarke-Neal is continuing at the helm of popular spin-off show Big Brother's Bit on the Side. \nWhere is the Big Brother house and what does it look like? \nThe Big Brother house is in the Elstree studios in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, a 22 minute train journey from London Kings Cross Station. \nThis year, the house's theme has been inspired by the General Election and Brexit. \nBig Brother 18's official title is The United Kingdom of Big Brother, and the house has been given a kitsch makeover, with rooms inspired by various aspects of British culture. \nA twist will see housemates forced to live and sleep in separate spheres in the house, in keeping with the series' class-oriented theme, The United Kingdom of Big Brother. \nThose sleeping in the grotty bedroom will have to deal with graffiti on the walls and furnishings, rickety wooden bed frames, a dirty carpet, old hand-me-down bedding and minimal storage. \nMeanwhile the luxury bedroom is the definition of cosy, with beautiful turquoise walls, animal imagery, pristine bedding and a homey atmosphere. \nThis year the house is split into rich and poor sectors \nHow long has Big Brother been running? \nThe Big Brother reality TV concept originated in the Netherlands, with the first series airing in 1997. \nFollowing its success, the show came to the UK in 2000, with Craig Phillips the British version's first winner. \nAfter 11 series on Channel 4, Big Brother moved to Channel 5 in 2011, where it has remained ever since. \nThe show has provided some of the most controversial moments in reality TV history, and catapulted the likes of Jade Goody, Nikki Grahame and Chanelle Hayes to fame.
