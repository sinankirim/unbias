This resulted in margins being squeezed in an attempt to maximise sales.

Volume increased by 14%, while the gross margin grew by 15%.

Profit after tax also fell, from £368,000 to £153,000. \nSpringfield increased head count from 95 to 98 at the end of 2016, adding to its staffing costs, which grew from £2.7m to £2.8m. \nThe firm’s highest paid director received £145,368 last year, up from £140,298 during the previous year. \nMr Price added that market conditions during 2017 would likely mirror conditions at the end of 2016, which could lead to more favourable results for the firm. \nHe said: “The company strategy is to continue to focus with our current manufacturer partners in our current market, while identifying franchise opportunities within the North East of England. \n“The directors anticipate that the trading environment will continue throughout 2017 in the same as at the end of 2016, with new car registrations remaining high, influenced by pre-registration activity; fleet activity and demand to be high; used cars supply to be challenging and after-sales remaining high.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-06-26T23:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-06-26T18:36:31.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
