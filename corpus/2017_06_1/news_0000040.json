jobs-first Brexit, mention the issues of young people and austerity, there’s many other things.” \nOn Brexit, Mr Corbyn said he wants a “jobs-first Brexit” negotiated as quickly as possible along with guaranteeing the post-Brexit rights of EU nationals living in the UK. Gateshead Race for Life finish line \nHere’s a great clip of the finish line at the Gateshead Race for Life: General Election Tom Eden May - DUP talks in Downing Street \nDemocratic Unionist leader Arlene Foster is set to hold talks with Theresa May in Downing Street to finalise an agreement on propping up her minority government. (Photo: PA) \nThe DUP confirmed that Mrs Foster would be going to No10 on Tuesday after discussions in Belfast over the weekend were said to have made “good progress”. \nMrs Foster told Sky News: “We had very good discussions yesterday with the Conservative Party in relation to how we could support them in forming a national government - one that would bring stability to the nation. Those discussions continue.” \nDowning Street initially said on Saturday that an outline agreement on a “confidence and supply” arrangement had been reached with the DUP which would be put to the Cabinet for discussion on Monday. \nBut it later disclosed that no deal had been finalised and talks on the arrangement will continue during the week as Mrs May desperately tries to shore up her position after losing her Commons majority in the election. \nThe strength of any deal looks set to be tested when the Commons meets, with Jeremy Corbyn vowing to try to bring down the Government by defeating Mrs May in Parliament and insisting: “I can still be prime minister.” \nIn another sign of the dangers facing Mrs May, Sunday papers reported that Boris Johnson was either being encouraged to make a leadership bid in an effort to oust her, or actually preparing one - a claim dismissed as “tripe” by the Foreign Secretary.
