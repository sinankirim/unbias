We now have just 19, so I want the Government to increase orders not only for frigates, but for offshore patrol craft. \n\"More frigates, modularly constructed and supporting marine engineering and shipbuilding businesses, large and small, in Plymouth, across the south-west and across our nation, are exactly what our country needs.\" \nMr Pollard also urged the government to pay for emergency work to replace combustible cladding on the three Plymouth towers , saying \"there can be no compromise on safety\". \nHe added: \"Plymouth is one of the UK's great cities, a grand bastion of parliamentary democracy from the Sabbath Day fight during the English civil war on Freedom Fields to the modern day. \n\"Plymouth has seen the pilgrim fathers setting sail on the Mayflower, a fleet setting sail to defeat the Spanish armada and Captain Cook setting sail on his voyages, and there are many more examples. \n\"As a base for marine research and expertise, we are second to none. \n\"That is why I want not only a ministry of maritime affairs to be set up in Plymouth after Brexit, but Plymouth Sound to be designated as the country's first national marine park. \n\"Plymouth's great contribution has not always been matched by us receiving our fair share. The poor deal that we have at the moment as a city is not one that I will accept or vote to cut further. \n\"Progress towards Plymouth achieving its fair share has happened, but not quickly enough. It must now up a gear.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-06-29T00:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-06-29T02:01:49.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
