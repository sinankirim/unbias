that dubious honour was clinched in Newcastle Central. \nThe Conservative vote stood up across the area but UKIP have been all but wiped out in the region that has become so strongly associated with Brexit. \nWearside has grown used to having the eyes of the world’s media on it in recent years but voters weren’t in the mood to put on a show, opting for the status quo. \nMs Phillipson received 24,665 votes on a turnout of 61%, up from 55.1% in 2015. \nShe told the crowd at Silksworth Community Pool, Tennis and Wellness Centre: “ The Labour Party was founded to secure political power for communities like ours. \n“We still believe the Government can be a force for good.” Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now \nThen came Sunderland Central , the seat which Labour might have been most worried about in the event of a big swing to the Tories. \nIn the end, Julie Elliott dispatched of her Conservative challenger with relative ease, racking up 25,056 votes on a 62.1% turnout, up from 57% in 2015. \nShe said: “I spoke to more than 6,000 people this campaign, sometimes having difficult conversations and listening carefully and, the promises I have given to you, I will keep.” \nThen Sharon Hodgson capped it off with a similarly assured performance in Washington and Sunderland West , receiving 24,639 votes on a 60.4% turnout, up from 54.6%. \nShe laced into Theresa May, saying this election “could prove to be her undoing”. \nBut all three saw their majorities slightly reduced: Elliott’s by 1,182 votes; Phillipson’s by 597; and Hodgson’s by 217. \nHowever, that will be of little concern on a night which saw the party defy conventional wisdom and perform relatively strongly across the UK. \nThe Conservatives picked up an extra 15,164 votes compared to the 2015 election but that wasn’t enough to remotely worry Labour. \nThe UKIP vote across Wearside completely collapsed - across the three seats, their vote count has gone from 23,598 to 7,349 in just two years. \nSunderland’s three female MPs have defied any political expectations that formed after the referendum on membership of the European Union. \nMany initially thought this would be ‘the Brexit election’ and see areas which voted Leave flock to the Conservatives. \nThat hasn’t materialised and the old tribal pull the party still exerts in the North East has trumped any swing towards a more vociferously pro-Brexit party.
