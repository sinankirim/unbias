And alongside that Jeremy Corbyn had a first rate campaign. People are warming to him and they are just not buying all the assaults from our opponents. 22:41 Michael Muncaster Votes on way from Holy Island \nIn Blyth, returning officer Geoff Paul says boxes from Holy Island and surrounding areas could arrive by 11.30pm. \nFingers crossed the causeway is clear. 22:36 Sunderland count gets under way \nThe stage is set at Sunderland. \nThe race is now on. 22:34 Kathryn Riddell Ballot boxes in Newcastle \nThe first ballot boxes have begun to arrive in Newcastle - they need to be quick if they want to be in with a chance of declaring a result first. 22:28 Kathryn Riddell At Durham count \nWe have reporters across the county - Andrew will be waiting until the early hours to hear the results of three Durham seats. 22:25 'Humiliating result for Theresa May' \nHere’s our political analysis on the exit poll from reporter Mike Kelly: \nThis is a humiliating result for Theresa May. She called the snap election to get a strong mandate for Brexit negotiations and has spectacularly failed. \nAnd, I hate to say this, it could possibly mean another general election not too far down the line because Mrs May will struggle to form a Coalition, and so will Labour. 22:22 Kathryn Riddell Newcastle waiting for first ballot box \nAnd here’s Newcastle waiting to get stuck into the first ballot box in their race to beat Sunderland. \nMy money’s still on Sunderland but maybe Newcastle will prove me wrong. 22:20 More police at election counts \nIt seems police are showing up at counts across the region. \nArmed police are at Sunderland and Newcastle and police are also being shown around in Blyth. 22:18 Kathryn Riddell Accuracy of the exit poll \nWhile the opinion polls might have been volatile recently, the broadcasters’ exit poll - released when voting closes at 10pm - has a very good record in predicting the overall result since the BBC and ITV started pooling data in 2005. \nIn 2015, the poll predicted the Tories would win 316 seats (they actually won 330) and Labour 239 (they managed 232). \nIn 2010, the poll predicted the Tories would win 307 seats, which was almost spot on. They ended with 306 (although arguably 307, if you include the Speaker John Bercow). Labour got 258, or just three more than the 255 the poll predicted. \nIn 2005, the exit poll got Labour’s seat total exactly right - 356. It was over-optimistic where the Conservatives were concerned, however. The poll said they would get 209 seats. They actually got 198. 22:15", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-06-09T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-06-09T00:27:04.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
