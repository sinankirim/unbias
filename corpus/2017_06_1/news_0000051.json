Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nBusinesses in the North East stand ready to make a success of devolution if a deal can be agreed between local and national politicians, a business leader has said. \nSpeaking on a visit to the region, CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn said that North East businesses wanted to see action on key issues like skills, infrastructure and the digital economy where devolution of power to the region would be highly beneficial. \nAnd she said that many companies were prepared to “do the heavy lifting” when it came to tackling the region’s skills shortages in the hope of creating better jobs in the region. \nCouncil leaders in Newcastle, Northumberland and North Tyneside are trying to agree a ‘north of Tyne’ devolution deal with the Government after the collapse of an earlier agreement in the wider North East. \nThere have been concerns that the financial settlement being offered by the Government to the region is poor, but Ms Fairbairn said the important thing was to agree a deal to give local businesses and politicians something to build on. \nShe said: “We’re seeing investment coming into the North East around high productivity areas like life sciences and advanced manufacturing. These are the kind of jobs that we want. \n“If we can create the environment that continues to attract them, these companies will continue to grow. There are issues around skills, with real shortages in these areas in this part of the world. Bringing Government and businesses together on that issue around the devolution deal is a way we can really do something on skills.

You’ve got the green shoots here, you’ve got the right kind of investment. Unemployment has come down here but now the next stage has to be about the right kind of jobs.” \nThe North East recently lost its long-held position as the region of the UK with the highest unemployment, though joblessness is still above the national average. \nThe North East LEP said earlier this year that over 53,000 jobs created since 2014 and 63% of those jobs were classed as higher skilled, but the TUC highlighted a large growth in the number of insecure jobs in the region in recent years, with the North East having the highest number of people in work who had either no guaranteed hours or low employment rights. \nMs Fairbairn said she had noted a “huge sense of optimism” among North East businesses she met today, despite significant concerns about Brexit and the level of uncertainty in the economy. \nShe added: “Government funding can be a catalyst but what businesses can do is get behind this. One of the things we’ve been looking at nationally, but it’s a real strength in the North East, is careers advice and how you get businesses collaborating with schools to inspire young people.

This is about getting the right partnership between Government and business so that businesses do quite a lot of the heavy lifting. Because they really want to - it’s in their interests to inspire talent from all parts of different communities to meet some of these skills shortages. \n“So whatever the size of your devolution deal, businesses can say where the money can be best be spent to have the maximum affect.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-06-29T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-06-29T22:20:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
