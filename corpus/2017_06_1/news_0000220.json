On the day before the General Election, supporters of the Labour Party leader will gather for a peaceful event. \nAt least 100 people are confirmed so far to be attending the event which organiser Tasmin Binks says is about projecting a message of positivity, rather than negativity. \nThe gathering will take place at the junction of Cathedral Yard and South Street, not on Cathedral Green, a cathedral spokesman said. \nMs Binks said: “We are organising a peaceful show of support for Jeremy Corbyn tomorrow from 2pm. \n“So far around 100 people have confirmed on Facebook that they will be attending the event.
