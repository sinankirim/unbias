In London, 32% said they wanted to remain in the EU or to hold another referendum, \nBut while the North still backs Brexit, voters aren’t convinced the Government is going to get a good deal. \nAsked how well or badly the Government is doing at negotiating Britain’s exit from the European Union, 26% of people in the North said the Government is doing well - and 45% said it was doing badly. \nThe survey found 29% of people in the North expect goods to become more expensive in the shops, and 21% said companies would be less likely to invest in the UK. \nAnd 14% of people in the North, around one in seven, expect quitting the EU to plunge the UK into a full-blown recession.

He quoted John Lennon’s Imagine at a press conference in Brussels, saying “you may say I’m a dreamer, but I’m not the only one” while addressing the prospect of the UK remaining in the bloc.

It is a most difficult process, for which the EU is well prepared. \n“You can hear different predictions coming from different people about the possible outcome of these negotiations - hard Brexit, soft Brexit or no deal. \n“Some of my British friends have even asked me whether Brexit could be reversed and whether I could imagine an outcome where the UK stays part of the EU. \n“I told them that, in fact, the European Union was built on dreams that seemed impossible to achieve. So, who knows. You may say I’m a dreamer, but I’m not the only one.” \nFrance’s new president Emmanuel Macron also restated his view that the UK could perform a U-turn on Brexit, and acknowledged the need to address the problems caused by free movement of people - one of the triggers for the Leave vote. \nHe told the Guardian: “The door is open until the moment you walk through it. It’s not up to me to say it’s closed. \n“But from the moment things are engaged with a timescale and an objective, it’s very hard to go back, we can’t lie to ourselves.” \nThe Queen’s Speech on Wednesday included the announcement of eight Brexit bills, which the Government will need to get approved over the next two years. \nIt could be a challenge for Theresa May’s Government , as the Tories are eight seats shy of a Commons majority.
