Liberal Democrats leader Tim Farron, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas, Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood, Home Secretary Amber Rudd, Ukip leader Paul Nuttall and SNP deputy leader Angus Robertson take part in the BBC Election Debate hosted by BBC news presenter Mishal Husain, as it is broadcast live from Senate House on May 31, 2017 (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \nAnd voters in Blyth Valley, Northumberland, searched for information about terrorism more than any other subject. \nPerhaps surprisingly, voters in Blaydon and North Durham searched for religion more than anything other issue connected to politics. \nGoogle tracked search queries across the UK from October 2016 to April 2017 and gave the results to the Chronicle. \nThe NHS was the most searched-for topic in almost two-thirds of constituencies across the country, some 402 out of 650. \nThe EU and Brexit came out on top in 86 seats, while pensions were the most interesting to voters in 70 seats. \nLabour have promised that the NHS will get £6billion a year extra raised from new taxes on the nation’s highest earners.

To help raise funds, the fees charged to migrants for using the NHS would be tripled. \nThe Tories have also stated that they would introduce the first new mental health Bill for 30 years.
