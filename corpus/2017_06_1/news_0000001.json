Free movement of labour has to end but we are not prepared to use EU migrants as bargaining chips - they should be able to stay if they are living and working in this country paying taxes. We want a fair immigration policy.” \nThose earning over £80,000 a year would be asked to pay more towards the NHS. “Also we would provide free parking at hospitals,” Mr Clarke said. “We would reinstate the nursing bursary to start training our own people too. Post Brexit there will be job creation and opportunities to retrain for new jobs.” \nHe insisted their plans were fully costed: “When interest rates are so low, why not borrow to invest?” \nHis party wanted to bring in regional investment banks to put money into infrastructure and local projects, promising schools would be funded correctly, free primary school meals, but no new grammar schools. \nMr Clarke said: “I would like to see the A17 dualled to get goods to the A1 quicker to give businesses a fighting chance. I want to live in a community where everyone has an opportunity to prosper together.” \nl Also standing for Sleaford and North Hykeham: Sally Chadd (UKIP), Paul Coyne (Independent), Caroline Johnson (Conservative), Fiona McKenna (Green) and Ross Pepper (Liberal Democrats).
