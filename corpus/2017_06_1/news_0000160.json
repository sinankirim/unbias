Last summer, Teignbridge Council approved the introduction of a public space protection order (PSPO) for the heart of Dawlish, which bans anti-social behaviour such as drinking and rough sleeping, drug taking and littering. \nFailure to comply with the PSPO being a criminal offence and it came after years of concern the green space in the heart of the town has been taken over by anti-social behaviour which has affected the image of the town as a family friendly destination. \nNine months since the introduction, Rob Kingdon the safeguarding and anti-social behaviour officer for the South Devon and Dartmoor Community Safety Partnership, said that the PSPO has helped to put a stop to anti-social behaviour in the town.

In the majority of cases early intervention is successful, helping keep Teignbridge a safe and pleasant place to live and visit. This PSPO helps put a stop to anti-social behaviour in a place where it was having a really negative impact on the local community. \n\"Since the PSPO was introduced in Dawlish there's been a noticeable drop in anti-social behaviour and it's given police additional powers to deal with any anti-social behaviour or problems when they are reported. The local policing team for Dawlish have been really proactive and we are grateful in supporting and helping to enforce the order. Read more What's that noise? Here come the muscle cars \n\"Fixed penalty notices have been issued where people are found to be in breach of the order. We recognise that a PSPO is not a quick-fix or a single answer. We are continuing to work with partner organisations so we can continue to understand and deal with the underlying issues. If anyone believes the conditions of this PSPO have been breached, please call the police on 101.\" \nThe area for the PSPO covers The Lawns, and runs from the toilets by Barton Hill Car Park to the seafront bordered by Brunswick Place and the Strand.
