What constituency am I? \nEnter your postcode below to find out more details on your constituency. The constituency \nSouth Shields originally boomed as a shipbuilding and coal mining town, but both industries went into decline, leaving the town with high unemployment that eventually faded as the town instead became a home of light industry and service employment. \nSouth Shields has also remained a seaside resort and tourist town. The seat contains several large council developments, including the Whiteleas, Biddick Hall, West Harton estates and Cleadon Park. \nPolitically South Shields is an extremely solid Labour seat. It has been held by the Labour Party since 1935. Until 2013 it was held by the former Foreign Secretary and Labour leadership contender David Miliband. Miliband retired to the backbenches after losing the leadership to his younger brother and in 2013 announced his intention to resign as an MP and leave British politics to take up a senior charity role in the USA. The subsequent by-election was held by Labour with MP Emma Lewell-Buck taking the seat. Labour - Emma Lewell-Buck Emma Lewell-Buck \nEmma was born in South Shields in 1978 and educated at Northumbria University . \nFirst elected in 2013 in a by-election after David Miliband gave up his seat. She is the town’s first woman MP, and the only one who was born in the constituency. Mrs Lewell-Buck has lived in South Tyneside all her life, and served as a councillor for nine years before her election. \nShe has opposed the bedroom tax and called for action on the cost of living crisis. \nMrs Lewell-Buck served as the Shadow Minister (Education) (Children and Families) from October 2016. UKIP - Richard Elvin \nMr Elvin is standing again in South Shields after running in the 2013 by-election and has stood in Middlesbrough before. \nOriginally from Lincolnshire, he moved to the North East in the 1970s to train as a teacher. He runs an internet travel company. \nHe is calling for an end to parking charges in South Shields, scrap NHS parking charges, regenerate King Street and says he will push for Brexit which is not “watered down”. Conservatives - Felicity Buchan Conservative candidate Felicity Buchan with Theresa May \nFelicity was brought up in Aberdeenshire and attended comprehensive school. She read Law at Oxford University. She went on to work in finance as a managing director and is now a chair of governors at a state school. \nMs Buchan says the three most important issues for South Shields are Brexit , the economy and opportunity. \nShe says she is passionate about attracting business and having good quality state schools. Green Party - Shirley Ford \nFormer youth worker and childminder Shirley Ford has lived in South Shields for 17 years, and now works in a primary school as an administrator. She says she is deeply concerned at austerity’s impact on the education system and says she would keep schools in community hands if she is elected. \nMrs Ford wants to reverse NHS “privatisation” and push for funding for Metro expansion and improvements, along with an integrated smart ticketing system across the whole North East. \nShe is calling for a £10-an-hour living wage and says the government must invest in jobs. Liberal Democrats - Gita Gordon Liberal Democrat Gita Gordan \nGita Gordon is again running in South Shields after contesting the seat in 2015. \nShe runs a small cosmetic production business and says she is pleased with her party’s pledge to give budding entrepreneurs a £100 a week living costs allowance. \nMrs Gordon has volunteered for the British Heart Foundation and worked in the care sector. Her experience includes working with domestic violence victims, disadvantaged children and people with disabilities. \nBorn in India, she says she is delighted to be running in South Shields again, as she loves the area. What was the result in South Shields in 2015? \nA total of 18,589 votes gave Mrs Lewell-Buck a 51% share and a majority of 10,614 over second-placed UKIP candidate Norman Dennis. \nConservative candidate Robert Oliver gained 6,021 votes, a 5% increase on their 2013 share, to finish in third place. \nShirley Ford from the Green Party picked up 1,614 votes, just ahead of independent candidate Lisa Nightingale on 1,427, while the Liberal Democrats’ Gita Gordon finished last with 639.
