Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nMichael Gove has been called upon to make sure farmers can access a reliable workforce after Brexit . \nThe National Farmers Union (NFU) has said that as new Defra Secretary of State, Michael Gove needs to makes sure that farmers can hire seasonal workers, who often come from EU countries. \nThe NFU’s concerns come after new statistics found that the number of seasonal workers has dropped 17%, leaving some farms critically short of people to harvest fruit and vegetables at a vital time. \nIn May, during a busy harvest period, there were over 1,500 unfilled vacancies. NFU horticulture and potatoes vice chair, Ali Capper (Photo: Publicity Pic) \nNFU horticulture and potatoes board chairman Ali Capper said: “A lack of clarity regarding the UK’s future relationship with the EU and a weakened sterling has contributed to the reduction in workers on farm now being reported by labour providers who source seasonal workers. \n“Farmers and growers need to know how the Government will deal with the need from industries that rely on seasonal workers and the NFU is calling for reassurance farmers will be able to source a reliable and competent workforce both now and in the future. \n“Without that, this trend is likely to continue and at this stage in the season any further tightening in the workforce will hit hard on farms.” \nThe NFU is also calling on the Government to provide clarity on the new rules for EU migrants living and working in the UK. \nThe survey of labour providers showed that the number of labour providers unable to meet the requirements of the farms they supplied rose four-fold. \nIt also revealed that the number of returning workers, which form a sizeable and dependable source of workers, dropped from 65% to 33% during the first five months of the year. \nMrs Capper said: “Returnees are absolutely vital.

If we do not have the pickers, we do not have a soft fruit industry. \n“It is inconceivable that people who voted to leave the European Union wanted to destroy an iconic and incredibly competitive British horticulture industry, and see the end of buying British produce.
