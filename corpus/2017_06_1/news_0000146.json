They are also bucking the trend reported recently in the national press that small housebuilders are being stifled by planning red tape. \nRecent permissions in Devon include 21 homes off Barbican Road in Barnstaple and the forthcoming redevelopment of Old School House in Bideford into apartments following the success of the neighbouring Grenville Place site. \nLast year, Newland Homes had 13 live sites across the South West and completed the sale of 186 plots – 110 of these on the open market and 76 were affordable homes. \nThis includes Grenville Place in Bideford. There are just three homes left at this site offering modern split-level living, with a further development of apartments at Old School House planned to start this year. \nDavid Foreman, Newland Homes managing director, said: \"2016 was, thanks to all our efforts, a fantastic year for sales, land purchases, planning permissions and construction. \n\"The future is bright and, subject to no major issues around Brexit, we are confident that our well-established, long serving, loyal team, combined with our very welcome and much needed new recruits, will see us continue to build our brand and reputation. \n\"This year has already got off to a flying start and we plan to continuing building and growing on the success we have already achieved in our 25th year. With exciting developments across the region, including Whitebridge Gardens in Thornbury, Broad Blunsdon Heights in Swindon, Oakfield Road in Frome and Cotswold Edge in Mickleton, we have properties to suit all types of homebuyer. \n\"We're also planning for success in 2018, with the forthcoming start of further developments in Bideford, Stroud and Hempsted, as well as expanding into new areas including Chipping Sodbury, Twyning, Evesham, Barnstaple, and Cheltenham.\" \nFor more information on Newland Homes, visit www.newlandhomes.co.uk or call 01452 623000.
