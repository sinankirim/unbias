Just. The majority of people who took part think they are less well off than their parents. There’s a clear Brexit split between those who think it will be a good thing for the region and those who think it will be bad. There is a large number of people in the region who classify themselves in Theresa May’s ‘Just About Managing’ category. People think job opportunities are much worse than a decade ago and a worrying number fear they will never own their own home GENERAL ELECTION A voter placing a ballot paper in the ballot box (Photo: Rui Vieira/PA Wire) \nWe asked how you voted at the 2015 general election and Labour came out on top with 39.8%. The Tories came second on 21.3%, UKIP third on 10.3% and the Lib Dems on 7.7%. \nHowever voting intentions for 2017 see the figures shift markedly. \nWhile the Conservative vote held up at 22%, for Labour the figure dropped to 27.6% - a large 12.2% fall. \nHowever, we began collating our results just before the start of the election campaign when Labour nationally was around 20% down in the opinion polls. \nTheir numbers have improved enormously since then and it’s worth considering the very large 25.73% in our survey who had yet to make up their minds in our survey. \nMeanwhile, 62% of respondents either were not happy or think the present government is a disaster. \nAnd 80% were not happy then with the way Labour was performing in opposition. \nOf the rest, the most notable is the 5.6% figure for UKIP which represents almost a halving of its support, the latest number reflecting where it stands today nationally. BREXIT An EU flag flying in front of the Houses of Parliament (Photo: PA) \nBrexit is not just one of the key issues of the general election, the thought hangs like an ominous cloud over the North East for a huge swathe of respondents to our survey. \nThere was an equal split over whether they think it will be good or not for region - 34% good or very good and 36% bad or disastrous. \nOf the people who took part, 45% voted remain and 43% Leave. Today 84% said they vote the same way.
