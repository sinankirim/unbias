Well it could be soon become a reality as plans have been submitted for a new escape room in the town. \nThe Escape Room follows the trend of similar real-life locked room mystery venues opening up across Britain - notably in Bristol, Bath, London and Manchester. \nThe concept owes much to \"escape the room\" video games as much as it owes to cult game show The Crystal Maze. \nRecently, two escape rooms have opened in Exeter - Mission Escape on 3 West Street, off the junction of Fore Street and New Bridge Street and Red House Mysteries within a unit at the King Street business centre. \nAnd now, customers in Newton Abbot will similarly have to solve puzzles within an allotted time in order to succeed. \nA planning application has been submitted to Teignbridge Council planners for a change of use from a storage facility and business offices (Use Class B1) to Escape Room Centre (Use Class D2 Entertainment and Leisure) at The Workshop , Lemon Place, Newton Abbot. Read more Hard and Soft Brexit are meaningless - we need a good Brexit:... \nThe application, submitted by Peter Kelsey, says: \"The property is currently used as a storage facility and business offices for a small plumbing supplies company. We would require a change of use. \n\"We are proposing changing the use to an escape room. An escape room being a room where participants are locked in a room for up to 60 minutes. They have to use the objects within the room, as well as logic and lateral thinking, in order to solve a series of clues and puzzles to find the key to escape.\" \nThe application adds that there will be no on-site parking, and says: \"Participants will be required to park in public car parks and walk on foot.

There will be no more than eight participants within the premises.\" \nThe earliest real-life room escape venue was created in Silicon Valley, California, by a group of programmers in 2006 - Drawing inspiration from the works of author Agatha Christie. \nSince, team-building Escape Rooms have boomed in Asian countries. With popular venues springing up in Japan, China, Singapore and South Korea - with commentators citing the experience as an escape from living conditions in their major cities. \nTeignbridge Council planners will make a decision on the change of use application.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-06-28T03:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-06-28T00:02:42.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
