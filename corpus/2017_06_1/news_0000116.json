Comments (0) \nLabour would easily come top of an election based on political party Twitter accounts - but they would still fall short of a majority. The Trinity Mirror data unit analysed the official Twitter accounts of the main parties in Britain in the final leg of the election campaign from June 1 to June 7. \nLabour shared by far the most popular tweets - every 140-character comment from them garnered an average of 593 retweets and 581 likes. \nThis compared to just 173 for each tweet from the Conservatives.
