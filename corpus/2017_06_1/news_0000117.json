Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nDirectors at construction company Surgo have warned of potential headwinds following signs their clients are waivering as Brexit negotiations start. \nThe Newcastle-based building contractor has issued accounts for the year ended August 31 2016, hailing another successful year for the firm as turnover was down by 8% on the last year but reached “a very credible” £30.6m. \nOperating profit topped £583,000, down on last year’s £992,000, which the firm said came in part to the additional costs of reinforcing the 80-strong team for the future. \nDirector Jeff Alexander admitted the climate for the firm was “challenging”, though he said a number of recent wins had boosted the company. \nIn a report alongside the accounts, chairman Ian Walker said he didn’t believe the firm’s results gave give a true picture of a construction tough market, and that there seemed to be some uncertainty within the industry.

Our exceptional people are fundamental to our success this year and their continued support and enthusiasm will continue to carry us forward.” \nOff site, Mr Walker said that the year had been a difficult one in accounting terms, after a new software system was installed in an “extremely frustrating operation”. \nLooking ahead, managing director James Walker detailed future work in the accounts. \nAmong the projects the firm is currently working on is the £3.8m redevelopment and refurbishment of Newcastle University’s Hatton Gallery, and the first phase of converting a 200-year-old property in Durham city centre to luxury apartments and student accommodation. \nMr Alexander said: “Whilst the climate remains challenging, as reported in the chairman’s statement, I am pleased to say that we have recently had a number of successful tenders and this gives us every confidence that we will enjoy another good year.” Like us on Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-06-08T23:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-06-08T18:29:59.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
