The first boxes (and bags) arrive to the count. Photo: David Dawson \n“I have noticed we’ve had a very, very low key, almost lack of interest among the public... I’m surprised,” he said. \nHe said he had spoken to Mr Nuttall’s PR person tonight but said he had not heard how Paul, who is reportedly waiting in a hotel room until shortly before the results, is doing. \nOn the exit polls tonight, Mr Ransome said: “There was an exit poll with Brexit when Nigel Farage said he was throwing in the towel - so there you go, the pollsters aren’t always accurate.” \nMany voters have commented that UKIP have less of a chance this time round, and it’s been said that UKIP missed its chance by not running Nigel Farage in the constituency when the party saw its popularity saw in 2015.

We did ask Nigel Farage, in fact Paul Nuttall asked Mr Farage to stand here last time... it was a missed opportunity.” \nThursday, 11.52pm - Election night is underway, the boxes of votes have arrived and are being verified and at least one candidate has already turned up. \nUKIP leader Paul Nuttall, it has been confirmed, will not be arriving until shortly before the results are due to be announced. A party spokesman confirmed he is staying in a hotel room in Boston and that party representatives would be attending the count earlier. \nLiberal Democrat Philip Smith was the first candidate to arrive - admitting he hadn’t really had chance this year due to the surprise of Theresa May’s snap election.
