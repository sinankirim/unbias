It means that as leader, she could go in to the net election unsure whether she can retain her seat.

Working class and straight-talking, he could be a good choice. He stood for the Conservative leadership once before, when he was beaten by David Cameron. Michael Fallon \nThe Defence Secretary was one of the few Ministers wheeled out to television studios during the campaign. A smooth talker, he may come across as a bit too posh to be leader.
