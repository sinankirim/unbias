The retailer also has four smaller format stores. \nLast year Ikea reiterated its commitment to investing in Britain following the Brexit vote, with Ms Drakeford saying at the time: “We believe there is a lot of opportunity in the UK. \n“We've been evaluating our newest stores and formats and yes, absolutely, there will be more stores. We will continue to invest in the UK.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-06-04T16:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-06-04T12:38:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
