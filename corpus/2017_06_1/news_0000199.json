We should be like the Americans and just have two. All these people sitting in Parliament getting all that money, and half of them never speak. It's the same with the House of Lords. \n\"It's all got out of hand, they're all in it for the money.\" \nMr Treagood added that all he was worried about now was \"getting out of bloody Europe.\" \n\"I never did like the idea of being part of Europe and I'm not going to change my mind now. I don't know what all this hard and soft Brexit is all about, just go to them and say we're going to leave and then leave.\" \nJohn, 81, is known to many across the South West region after spending more than 40 years after leaving the army travelling with his horse and cart and stopping at various roadsides on his way around the area. \nA worldwide funding appeal in 2015 saw enough money raised for John to buy new horse Misty after Gildor, his horse of 18 years, died Read More ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-06-15T18:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-06-15T15:51:04.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
