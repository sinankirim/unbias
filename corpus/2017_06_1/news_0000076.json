He would walk in to see the bosses and say 'this is what we want and if I don't get it I am out of here' \n\"That's what he used to do, that's the way to negotiate. It's how you start anyway.\" \nRead more: Councillor calls for Exeter's Naked Bike Ride to be called off after children exposed to nudity \nMr Crowther, who became caretaker leader after party's disastrous General Election showing, insisted UKIP was here to stay. \nHe denied the EU vote had completed a Kamikaze mission and said the party would continue because it \"stands for something\" which is not represented by mainstream parties. \n\"That's why UKIP came into business, that's why we were regarded by the establishment for many years as mad and that's why we, in the end, commanded a majority of the populus for our view.\" \nReturn to Devon Live or read Fishing leader urges Brexit negotiators not to squander gold opportunity ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-06-23T23:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-06-23T23:03:12.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
