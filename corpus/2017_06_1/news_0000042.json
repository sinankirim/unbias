  \nWansbeck MP Ian Lavery has clinched a top position in Jeremy Corbyn’s new shadow cabinet. \nThe Ashington -born politician, who was Labour’s election co-ordinator, has been named party chairman as Mr Corbyn re-jigs his top team. \nThe Labour leader tonight unveiled a shadow cabinet reshuffle as he vowed to “form the next government”. \nMr Lavery , who has served as MP for Wansbeck since 2010, replaces previous party chairman Tom Watson, who will remain as elected deputy leader and shadow culture secretary. \nAccording to the Mirror, a source close to the Labour leader insisted the shake-up had nothing to do with Mr Watson’s past comments on Mr Corbyn. \nGiving Mr Lavery the chairman’s job was about “continuing to be on a general election footing” and he was a “natural fit” for it, the source added. (Photo: Daily Mirror) \nThe reshuffle also saw Mr Corbyn’s former leadership rival Owen Smith return to the shadow cabinet as shadow Northern Ireland secretary. \nLesley Laird also makes it to the top team as shadow Scottish secretary, just days after being elected as MP for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath. \nDawn Butler will be shadow minister for diverse communities.

Meet Jeremy Corbyn's General Election co-ordinator for Labour \nMr Corbyn said: “I am delighted to announce four appointments to fill shadow cabinet vacancies. \n“I look forward to working with the strengthened shadow cabinet as we prepare a government in waiting to carry out our manifesto for the many not the few. \n“Our party is now on a permanent campaign footing in anticipation of the failure of Theresa May’s attempt to establish a stable administration with the support of the DUP. \n“I am therefore appointing Ian Lavery, co-national campaign coordinator, to the additional role of Labour Party Chair to strengthen our campaigning and party organisation, as we prepare to contest a new general election and form the next government.” \nMr Lavery and Andrew Gwynne will stay on as joint campaign co-ordinators as Labour prepares for another snap election if Theresa May’s government collapses. \nMr Lavery won the Wansbeck seat comfortably in the general election with 24,338 votes, beating nearest rival Tory Chris Galley by more than 10,000 votes. \nHe hit the headlines during the election campaign when a video of him becoming involved in an argument with foreign secretary Boris Johnson went viral.
