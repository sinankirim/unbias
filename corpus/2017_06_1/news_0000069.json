The factory is building 57 new trains for the Great Western Railway, one of a number of orders in the UK that is supporting the £82m facility, which created 900 new jobs, including 50 apprentices.

From the autumn, passengers will begin to feel the benefits of the new British-built fleet as they travel around the Great Western route.” Hyperdrive in Cramlington (Photo: Handout) \nThe Great Western trains are one of a number of orders won by the Hitachi plant since it opened two years ago. It is also building trains for East Coast and Hull Trains, and calls have been made for the plant to get the order for HS2 rolling stock. \nHitachi’s global chairman Hiroaki Nakanishi has warned, however, that the long-term future of the plant would rely in part on the Government negotiating a Brexit deal that allowed the company to export trains to Europe. \nRenowned Victorian engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel created the GWR route the royal couple travelled along and they were joined for the journey by his descendant, Isambard Thomas. \nMr Thomas, 53, Brunel’s great-great-great-grandson, said after the journey: “I think train travel is a quicker way to get around because the roads are too congested now.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-06-13T23:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-06-13T18:28:55.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
