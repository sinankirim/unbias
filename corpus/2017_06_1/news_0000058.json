Comments (0) \nNorth Devon's Steve Crowther has issued a further statement to Devon Live following the news that he will be leading UKIP. \nMr Crowther is set to lead UKIP after former party leader Paul Nuttall stood down following the party's disastrous General Election showing. \nRead more: New UKIP leader is Devon's Steve Crowther \nMr Nuttall stood down as the leader of the party after it failed to win any seats in the General Election and Mr Crowther agreed to step in to lead the party on an interim basis. \nThe 60-year-old former trade journalist and writer ran an advertising agency in London which specialised in marketing technology, before moving to Heanton near Braunton. \nAfter the announcement of his appointment as temporary leader, Mr Crowther said he was \"honoured\" to have been asked by the NEC to stand in as Interim Leader. \nMr Crowther will be standing in as Interim Leader for UKIP for the next few weeks until a new party leader is elected. \nFollowing on from Devon Live's earlier story Mr Crowther said: \"I am very conscious that here in North Devon, and across Devon and the South West, people voted in large numbers last year for the UK to leave the EU. \n\"By calling a so-called \"Brexit election\" and then making a pig's ear of it, Mrs May has caused a flurry of suggestions that we're now not going to leave, or at least have some sort of wishy-washy half-in-half-out status. \n\"I am absolutely determined not to let this happen. People in North Devon have always been at the forefront of the Eurosceptic movement. \n\"They don't trust the EU, they want their fishing fleet back, and they want to go out and ply their trades around the world as their forefathers did, rather than looking to be trapped inside the failing EU economy.\" \nMr Crowther also said that he heard that people were \"flooding back to UKIP today\". \nHe said: \"I hear that people are flooding back to UKIP today, aware that Mrs May has dropped the ball, and that only UKIP is prepared to pick it up and run with it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-06-09T23:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-06-09T20:16:00.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
