Headline figures were also hampered by slower revenue growth and rising spare capacity. \nDavid Duffy, CEO at CYBG, said: “Never forget, small and medium-sized businesses are the absolute engine room of the British economy, and their future prospects are going to be ever more critical in a post-Brexit world, where we are dependent on a stronger and more competitive domestic economy. \n“It is vital that we understand how SMEs are performing.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-06-26T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-06-26T02:32:18.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
