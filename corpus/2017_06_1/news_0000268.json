From the autumn, passengers will begin to feel the benefits of the new British-built fleet as they travel around the Great Western route.” \nThe Great Western trains are one of a number of orders won by the Hitachi plant since it opened two years ago. It is also building trains for East Coast and Hull Trains, and calls have been made for the plant to get the order for HS2 rolling stock.

I think train travel is a quicker way to get around because the roads are too congested now.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-06-13T21:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-06-13T18:29:16.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
