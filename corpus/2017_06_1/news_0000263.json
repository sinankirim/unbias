It's been a bad election for the independence-supporting Scottish National Party Share Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now     \nScottish independence looks to be off the agenda after the SNP suffered losses in Scotland. \nThe Tories and Labour both took seats from the independence-supporting SNP, with veteran nationalist Mike Weir ousted by the Conservatives. \nHe had held the Angus seat since 2001, but was defeated by Kirstene Hair, who took more than 45% of the vote. \nThe Conservatives increased their share of the vote in Angus by just over 16% - while Nicola Sturgeon’s party saw its support slump by almost the same amount. \nAfter the result was declared, Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson showed her delight on Twitter, saying: “Yass! Well done.” \nThe result came after an exit poll suggested the SNP could lose 22 seats across Scotland. \nThe nationalists had swept the board in 2015, winning 56 of the 59 seats up for grabs. \nIt meant they were almost certain to lose seats this time. But election seems to have gone worse from them than expected. \nThe first result in Scotland this time went to Labour, with the party winning Rutherglen and Hamilton West. \nIn Paisley and Renfrewshire South, the SNP’s Mhairi Black was re-elected with 16,964 votes - although the party’s support in the seat fell by 10%. \nMs Black became the youngest MP when she won the seat in 2015 at the age of 20, ousting then Labour shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander.
