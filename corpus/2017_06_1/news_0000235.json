Let’s not speculate until we get more data. Overall it looks like being a very good night for Conservatives locally. I have visited every polling station in the constituency today and locally the turnout has been much higher than expected. My campaign is different to the one run nationally with different issues but you have to remember it isn’t about being popular it it about making the decisions that are right for the country.” Labour candidate Paul Kenny.

I’m surprised,” he said. \nHe said he had spoken to Mr Nuttall’s PR person tonight but said he had not heard how Paul, who is reportedly waiting in a hotel room until shortly before the results, is doing. \nOn the exit polls tonight, Mr Ransome said: “There was an exit poll with Brexit when Nigel Farage said he was throwing in the towel - so there you go, the pollsters aren’t always accurate.” \nMany voters have commented that UKIP have less of a chance this time round, and it’s been said that UKIP missed its chance by not running Nigel Farage in the constituency when the party saw its popularity saw in 2015. \nMr Ransome agreed: “It was a missed opportunity. We did ask Nigel Farage, in fact Paul Nuttall asked Mr Farage to stand here last time... it was a missed opportunity.” The first boxes (and bags) arrive to the count.

A party spokesman confirmed he is staying in a hotel room in Boston and that party representatives would be attending the count earlier. \nLiberal Democrat Philip Smith was the first candidate to arrive - admitting he hadn’t really had chance this year due to the surprise of Theresa May’s snap election. \nHe explained he had planned to take a sabbatical from work to run in the original planned election, but had been unprepared for the announcement.
