Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nStrong performance in the North East has helped business advisory firm Deloitte report an 11% growth in revenue. \nThe company - which in February announced 75 new jobs in its Newcastle centre of excellence - saw its revenue increase to £3.4bn though distributable profit was flat year-on-year as it invested in its staff and new ways of working. \nChief executive David Sproul hailed the performance in a market affected by the Brexit vote and elections in the UK and the US as “good”, with the company also picking up work in its tax division resulting from that political upheaval. \nThe company, one of the Accountancy Big Four, pointed to consumer and industrial products, and to life sciences and healthcare, as sectors performing well in the global economy. \nIn Newcastle, where Deloitte employs more than 200 people, office senior partner Stephen Hall highlighted the firm’s impact on the wider region as a measure of its success over the last 12 months. \nHe said: “The accounting Centre of Excellence is a key element of the firm’s audit offering nationally and supports the work we do for some of our highest-profile national clients. We will continue to invest and anticipate increasing the number of people employed in this centre to 110. \n“The success of Deloitte is not only measured in the positive impact we make for our clients and our people, but also in the difference we make to the wider community. \n“Through our responsible business strategy, One Million Futures, we are supporting Action for Children, which gives children and young people the practical and emotional support they need to help them thrive and build the skills they need for adulthood.” Deloitte's UK CEO David Sproul (Image: Deloitte) \nGlobally, Deloitte increased revenue by £340m in the year ended May 31, from £3,040m to £3,380m. \nThe largest increases were seen in consulting revenue, which was up by 13.6%, and audit and risk advisory, up 13.1%. Distributable profit came in at £608m, giving an average profit per equity partner at £865,000. \nMr Sproul said: “This is a good performance in a complex and uncertain market which has been impacted by Brexit and the elections in the US and UK. \n“Our consulting and audit and risk advisory businesses both grew by double-digits. Consulting has continued to see significant demand for technology-enabled business transformation and there has been further strong growth in Deloitte Digital, our creative digital consultancy. \n“The firm won a series of major audits this year, including BAE Systems, BP, Centrica and GlaxoSmithKline which has taken our share of the FTSE 100 audit market to 26% and we saw further success in the FTSE 250, private and international markets. Our risk advisory business has seen increasing demand for supplier risk, cyber and regulatory advice. \n“Growth in tax was driven by the global tax reset, Brexit and the possibility of US tax reform, alongside continued demand for technology-enabled compliance services. Financial Advisory advised on 87 M&A deals last year with a total value of more than £7bn and we advised on 38% of main market IPOs. \n“We also saw strong growth in forensic driven by a number of large investigations and regulatory remediation work across Europe. From an industry perspective, growth was notable in consumer and industrial products and life sciences and healthcare.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-08-29T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-08-29T02:57:46.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
