Prime Minister Theresa May (Image: PA) \nOne Tory MP who was a guest said: “It’s clear she won’t lead us into another election and will be gone by September 2019. She invited MPs to Chequers to ensure there isn’t a ­leadership contest in the meantime. \n“Giving the dogs a stroke is better than giving them a kick, I suppose.” \nThe plan is to have a leadership election over the summer of 2019 with the winner announced on August 30. \nThe new PM would then face MPs on Tuesday, September 3, as Parliament returns from its summer break. \nMrs May is anxious to stamp out talk of a challenge when MPs gather in the Commons next week.

It needs 48 to trigger a contest. \nEx-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith is leading the operation to keep Mrs May in place, telling wavering MPs that internal squabbling must not derail the Brexit process.
