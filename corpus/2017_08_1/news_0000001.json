raise $477m on the New York Stock Exchange \nNorth East paint company Venator Materials is planning to raise $477m (£360.5m) by floating on the New York Stock Exchange. \nVenator, which is set to spin out from parent company Huntsman Corporation, makes a range of pigments and additives used in paints and has offices around the world. \nHuntsman is known for its success overseas and was named Medium and Large Exporter of the Year in the 2016 North East Exporters’ Awards. \nIn total the firm employs around 4,500 people worldwide and sells its products in more than 110 countries. \nThe initial public offering will see the firm issue 22.7m ordinary shares at an anticipated price of between $20 and $22 per share. All of the shares will be sold by Huntsman, and Venator will receive none of the proceeds from the offering. \nThe proceeds of the IPO will be used by Huntsman to repay the company’s existing credit facilities. \nVenator is headquartered in Stockton at Wynyard Park, but also runs four other sites in the UK, including one in Birtley, Gateshead. Outside of the UK, Venator has 23 sites in locations such as China, France, Germany, Malaysia, and the US.

British Gas was the last of the Big Six providers to increase prices after it promised in December last year to freeze tariffs until August, with its rivals moving to raise bills at the start of the year. \nUswitch’s own figures show London’s residents are 32% less likely than the average to switch supplier, followed by other cities such as Liverpool (-22%), Newcastle (-10%), Cardiff (-9%), Edinburgh (-5%) and Manchester (-4%). \nCity residents’ reluctance to switch energy supplier could be a result of having a high proportion of renters, despite all bill payers - home owners and tenants - having the right to change their tariff or provider. \nClaire Osborne, uSwitch.com energy spokeswoman, said: “It’s appalling that a third of Britain’s households are already worrying about how they will be able to afford to keep warm this winter, especially when half of them are already struggling with their household finances. \n“To make matters even worse, the latest price hike from British Gas will hit three million more energy customers just as they start to think about putting the central heating on.” Electricity pylons (Image: PA) Coreena Ford Madame Tussauds owner Merlin sees drop in demand following UK terror attacks \nMerlin Entertainments, the firm behind the London Eye and Madame Tussauds and big parks including Alton Towers and Chessington World of Adventures, has said that recent terror attacks hit visitor numbers at its city centre attractions in the first half of the year. \nThe firm suffered from “significantly reduced domestic demand” at its Midway division - which includes London Dungeons, Legoland and Shrek’s Adventure - adding that it remains cautious on international visitor numbers over the key summer trading period. \nThe attacks on London Bridge, Borough Market and Manchester Arena earlier this year contributed to holding Merlin’s pre-tax profit down in the six months to July 1, which came in flat at £50m. \nAt Midway, operating profit fell almost 17% to £57m in the period. \nThe terror attacks came after a bright period for Merlin, which said in March that profits were being boosted by the collapse in the value of the pound following the Brexit vote, which has resulted in an increase in tourists. Nevertheless, total revenue rose 9.6% to £685m on a constant currency basis, and was up 3.7% like-for-like. Visitors to Merlin’s attractions grew 6.2% to 29.7m. \nBoss Nick Varney said: “We continue to be excited by the long-term underlying growth prospects in our market and have the strategy in place to exploit these. “We remain on track to meet our 2020 milestone targets, supported not only by the attractions and accommodation opened to date, but also by the progress we have made on the pipeline, in particular the ongoing development of new brands which will underpin the longer-term rollout.” \nMeanwhile, the firm said it is making progress in its strategy to turn its theme parks into destination resorts, with expansion of holiday villages and hotels at Legoland Windsor, Legoland Florida and the successful opening of its 76-room CBeebies hotel at Alton Towers.A host of new attractions are being rolled out too, including the launch of Madame Tussauds Delhi in the second half of the year. \nMerlin is also looking at getting the required consents to open a Legoland park in New York. London Eye Coreena Ford Spotify picks Newcastle start-up Surveyapp to help improve New York office \nSpotify has brought in Newcastle start-up Surveyapp to help it improve its New York office after carrying out a high-profile move. \nSurveyapp, which uses its custom-made software to provide live feedback to businesses, is being used by the music streaming giant to find out whether its staff like the new facilities. \nIn February, Spotify revealed it was moving its US headquarters to 4 World Trade Center in Manhattan. The relocation saw the firm bring 1,000 staff members to the 400,000sq ft office. \nBut Spotify is keen to keep its staff happy after the move and is now using tech designed by the Newcastle Quayside firm to find out what its employees like and dislike about their new home. \n“Spotify moved into their new office last month in New York,” said Surveyapp CEO Savio Fernandes. “They purchased four devices and are using them to show how their employees are finding the new office space.” \nSurveyapp uses an iPad to allow companies to ask customers or staff simple questions, which are answered using a range of pictures such as smiling or angry faces. The answers are then immediately made available to management who can quickly react if there is an issue.

Northumberland has been the hardest hit, with 15 closures in its towns and villages, but there have also been 11 branch closures in Newcastle and 10 in different parts of Gateshead. \nMost of the closures have been made by the large high-street banks, with Barclays and HSBC – who had the largest network of branches in 2007 – both closing 13 branches in the past decade. \nCampaign groups and politicians say the bank closures are harming businesses and some more vulnerable customers, such as the elderly, who find it harder to access other branches. \nA number of the bank closures have occurred due to the consolidation in the banking market after the 2008 financial crash, with Abbey and Bradford and Bingley taken over by Santander, and the Universal Building Society merging with Newcastle Building Society. This led to duplication of branches in some areas. \nBut most of the closures have been part of cost-cutting measures that have led to some campaigners warning of an ‘epidemic’ that has left many businesses and customers struggling to access accounts.

The company is in the midst of a £300m cost efficiency programme and it anticipates cost savings of £70m in 2018, an incremental £130m in 2019 and £100 million impacting 2020. \nThe jobs cull was announced alongside its first-half results, which saw a 1% rise in revenue to £1bn, with statutory operating profit coming in at £16 million versus a loss in the same period last year. \nPearson chief executive John Fallon said: “Pearson has had a solid first half. We are making good progress on our strategic priorities and our guidance for 2017 remains unchanged. \n“We are focused on maximising performance through the critical second half. “Strong cash generation, prudent management of our balance sheet and implementation of our transformation plans are positioning us to be the winner in digital education, and create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders.” \nLast month Pearson announced it is selling a 22% stake in its publishing unit Penguin Random House to Germany’s Bertelsmann for around $1bn (£776m). \nThe education group will retain a 25% stake in Penguin Random House, and the deal will allow it to return £300m to shareholders via a share buyback. \nThe proceeds, Pearson said, will also allow it to strengthen the balance sheet and invest in its digital transformation.

Second-quarter profit came in at £680m, representing the bank’s second consecutive quarter in the black and follows on from a £259m profit in the first three months of the year. \nMr McEwan said: “We’re doing what we said we would at our full-year results in February - growing income, reducing cost and improving returns for shareholders, while also starting to deliver a better service for customers. \n“We see the first six months of this year as proof of the investment case for this bank: our path to sustainable profitability is becoming clearer and closer and we have resolved some of the most significant issues this bank faced.” \nRBS also said it has begun contingency planning for Brexit by engaging with the Dutch central bank to use its existing banking licence in the Netherlands. The bank requires an EU passport to continue operating its NatWest Markets business across the bloc and is the latest bank to outline Brexit plans. \nFirst-half operating profit came in at £1.95bn compared with a £274m loss last year, while adjusted operating profit rose from £1.15bn to £3bn. However, RBS also detailed £342m in second-quarter conduct and litigation costs and £213m in restructuring charges.
