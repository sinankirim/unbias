Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nWith concerns over falling revenues and nearly a third of its cash coming from foreign students, could the University of Sunderland be facing future financial difficulties? \nIn the Times Higher Education (THE) annual ‘university financial health check’, the Wearside institution came up more than once in tables of the universities showing potentially worrying signs. \nSunderland saw a drop in income of more than 3% in 2015/16, compared to the previous year. More starkly, it lost close to 5% of its income from fees in real terms in that same year. \nAccording to the paper, the close correlation between a drop in fees and a drop in overall income at universities like Sunderland highlights the importance of cash from students. Sunderland University in Sunderland City Centre (Image: Newcastle Chronicle) \nThis means such institutions could struggle to cope with any significant fall in demand for places. \nYet such a fall is judged by THE experts to be possible over the coming years. \nThis year, university applications fell by 4% from UK students, according to UCAS. Fewer people studying degrees means less tuition fees, as well as more competition for the pool of students who do apply. \nTHE also claims a “constant worry” over the past few years has been the potential for a stricter visa policy to be introduced, making it harder to recruit international students. \nThis worry could be compounded by Brexit, which might affect demand from EU students - already, the number of Europeans planning to take degrees in the UK has fallen by 5%.

With more than 30% of its cash coming from overseas or EU students, it is among those which could suffer if Britain becomes less attractive to foreign undergraduates. \nUniversity leaders themselves have admitted that the referendum result could have this effect, not just because of immigration arrangements and visa issues, but possibly due to foreign perception of the country.

This means much of its overseas income comes from students who stay overseas, which means they may be less affected by a lessening of desire to come and live in Britain. \nAnother silver lining for Sunderland is its Silver Award for undergraduate provision under the new Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF). \nThis scheme was designed to assess the quality of undergraduate teaching in universities and colleges, and Government originally warned that only places who scored silver or gold awards under the framework would be able to charge the highest permitted fees. \nAlthough this requirement has now been delayed, Sunderland’s high score means is not in danger of being forced to reduce its fees from the new, higher rate of £9,250, which it will be charging from the start of the 2017 academic year.
