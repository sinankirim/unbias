Here we speak to some local migrants and authority leaders on their views of the report. \nData released by the Migrant Rights Network last week, looks at the views of 136 migrants in Boston, revealing that two-thirds of them would like to see more done to bring communities together.

You can see that some were upset and it was very, very emotional to hear such stories. When you hear them you feel you want to help people.” \nMrs Matulioniene said many migrants wanted to learn English, but she said there was more to be done to encourage them, including hiring native speaking teachers. \nShe said some students had been ‘embarrassed’ and put off when attending an ESOL lesson where they could not understand the teacher fully. \nMrs Matulioniene agreed with a comment that the situation maybe had to get worse to get better. \n“After the Brexit vote the situation did get worse in the town in the beginning,” she said, noting that there had been reports of hate crimes and others. \n“But I think later, when we started working together with groups like BMIC and also migrant and native communities, we tried to build bridges to make that situation how we could help it to be.” \nShe said that more and more she was hearing positive things, including in the media, and said that she agreed that it could be that the situation had to get worse before it got better. \n“The vote was bad, in my personal opinion, but you can find something good from that and now we are taking positive actions and building bridges. \n“People started trying to make links and make bridges and communities began to build cohesion and understand each other. \n“It’s very, very positive and I hope that more and more local people will try to be more positive and understanding.” \nBoston More in Common member, volunteer for Lincolnshire Police and learner support at Boston College Hana Rafajova said the biggest issue was language (the inability to communicate in English) and exploitation. \nShe said: “The language barrier closely links to cohesion, therefore it is the key to any further actions.” \n“The inability to speak English links to exploitation and other abuse, isolation, crime and general unpleasant situations created by misunderstanding.” \nMrs Rafajova has begun setting up free English lessons for absolute beginners and has already had a huge response. \nBoston and Skegness MP Matt Warman said the report covered a lot of common ground, adding: “There is always someone saying one side should be doing more than the other, but we all want to get to the same place and thats a community that’s integrated and content with itself. \n“The report does demonstrate that the issues that English people want to deal with and the issues that the migrant community want to deal with are often very similar. \n“You hear people talk about community integration in terms of language barrier and different social attitudes.” \nHe said the report could be used in future to bolster applications for further funding from both the Controlling Migration Fund. \nHe also said it supported the case for English Language lessons, putting forward money for improving public services. \nHe looked to reassure migrants that following Brexit the aim was not to ask people ‘who have established themselves in this country to leave, there’s not going to be the aim that people are unwelcome and Britain is going to continue to welcome the people who want to come and be an active part of our country’. \nChief Insp Deborah Clark, of Lincolnshire Police, has also responded to the report, praising the work of two ‘dedicated officers who perform the role of community cohesion within the town’. \nThe duo look to improve engagement with the diverse communities with the aim of achieving a safe and secure community, through working with partner agencies and the communities. \n“Our community cohesion officers are heavily involved in community engagement and examples of this include attending factories, faith groups, community groups and local schools. This contact builds trust and confidence within the police and as result of this we have forged some strong relationships,” said Chief Insp Clark. \n“We have had numerous engagement activities in the Town which promotes social cohesion. \n“A recent example of this relates to a personal shopper experience at a local supermarket Korzinka.” \nChief Insp Clark continued: “In respect of hate crime, we deal with this robustly and we encourage members of the public to report incidents so we can deal appropriately. \n“I encourage members of the public to report hate crime or incidents to the police or to make contact with their local Neighbourhood Policing Team to discuss any issues. \n“I am confident that the measures we have in place to promote social and community cohesion are working and Boston is embracing the diversity.” Sign in", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-08-13T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-08-13T10:30:39.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
