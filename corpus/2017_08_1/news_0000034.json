That business is also leaving Grove Park. \nOther business that have recently relocated within the city include Weightmans law firm, which moved from Peat House in Waterloo Way, to Princess Road West, and commercial property agents Innes England, which has moved into Peat House. \nJon Wall, director of commercial banking for NatWest in Leicestershire and Rutland, said the team originally left the city because of a lack of appropriate office space. \nHe said: “I understand the intention was never to leave the city centre, but a lack of office space forced us to do that. Jon Wall, director of commercial banking for NatWest in Leicestershire and Rutland \n“As we got closer to the Grove Park lease coming to an end there was a real drive on our part to be part of the regeneration of the city centre and get into the heart of the business community. \n“To be back in the mix of things makes life a lot easier in terms of maintaining contacts with professions such as accountants and solicitors, and gives us more opportunity to pop out and see people. \n“It’s good to be back in the city centre and there’s a buzz about the new office and it’s all very positive. \n“It’s business as usual in terms of our existing customers. At the same time we would love to help out new clients as well, and customers have been happy to put our names forward to new contacts and we have been happy to pick up new customers. \n“We offer the full banking package, from accounts and financing to international transactions and electronic banking, and the good thing about this office is we’ve got everybody under one roof so they can all work together to offer the right level of expertise.” Read More Leicestershire bakery Geary's reveals plan to build new £15m factory \nThe move has included the teams supporting corporate, commercial and business banking, as well as teams from Lombard Asset Finance, Royal Bank of Scotland Invoice Finance and international specialists. \nMr Wall said the city and county’s economy appeared to be performing strongly despite concerns over Brexit and a high street slowdown. \nHe said: “The feedback we are getting from a significant proportion of our customers has been very positive. Most are doing really well. \n“We’ve got a vast variety of food manufacturers here doing well, such as Geary’s bakery which is expanding. \n“There’s still hosiery here, and while national retail figures can be up and down, locally we have not seen any fall off. \n“General manufacturing is doing pretty well and in property and housing there are a significant number of schemes such as in PRS (private rented sector), which is offering more city living, and an emphasis on leisure. \n“The biggest challenge for many of our clients is a shortage of properties.” Like us on Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-08-07T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-08-07T09:58:43.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
