This includes 15,572 people coming into the region and 5,950 leaving. \nThere are 152,000 people living in the North East who were not born in the UK. That’s around one in 17 of the region’s entire population of 2.6 million people. Net migration has dropped to its lowest level in three years (Image: PA) \nThe report by MPs says that mayors and local councils should be allowed to set immigration policies in their regions. At a minimum, they should be able to allow employers “to offer particular jobs to \nnon-EU nationals without first advertising them domestically.” \nThe Government should also consider allowing local authorities to offer region-specific visas, the MPs said. They added: “Immigrants would be expected to stay in a particular region for a minimum period of time (perhaps two-to-three years) before gaining the right to live anywhere in Britain.” \nThe group also said every immigrant who did not speak fluent English should be required to take English classes, which they would pay for themselves under a system similar to student loans. \nMPs said their research had found many migrants felt the UK had become less tolerant since the Brexit vote. poll loading Should the North East have its own immigration policy? 0+ VOTES SO FAR Yes No \nMr Umunna said: “The demonisation of immigrants, exacerbated by the poisonous tone of the debate during the EU referendum campaign and after, shames us all and is a huge obstacle to creating a socially integrated nation.” \nNet immigration into the UK fell significantly to 246,000 a year - because EU citizens are quitting the UK Britain ahead of Brexit. \nDespite the fall, the figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that the Government is a long way from achieving its longstanding goal of getting immigration down below 100,000. \nThe total number of overseas immigrants coming into the UK was 588,000 in the 12 months up to March 31 2017. The number of people leaving the UK was 342,000.
