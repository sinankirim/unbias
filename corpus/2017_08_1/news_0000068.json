The opportunity to move to Edinburgh and to head up a new team at Edinburgh BioQuarter was a big draw for me. \n“I can see lots of opportunities to develop what is already a really attractive proposition and a unique place. When you look at what is already established at the park – the highly-skilled people, the hospital, the world-class research and the life sciences companies then we have great foundations to work from.” \nMr Möller, who had previously run a science park in his native Sweden before coming to the North East, recently spoke about the need for innovation in the North East economy as it adapts to the challenges of Brexit.
