world is changing and technology is at the heart of it – and the South West is becoming a hotbed for the digital innovation that will drive the economy during the next few years. \nFrom video production companies, to satellite imaging firms, to online ticketing ventures, the region, with Exeter and Plymouth at the epicentre, is leading the way in high-tech, digital invention. \nSo, Devon Live together with The Herald and its sister paper the Western Morning News has produced a list of 30 companies which are cutting it at the cutting edge. Read More Women needed for the Devon tech boom creating thousands of jobs \nSome of these firms are innovators in technology, some in new markets, some are growing impressively, or working with blue chip clients, or are simply SMEs with ambitious plans in sectors, such as online marketing and web design, which are fast becoming a bedrock of the new economy in as the world beds down in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. \nOur list is not exhaustive, and presented in alphabetical order. So if your firm is worthy of a place on a future list, please email hfinch@westernmorningnews.co.uk \nACRONYMS \nBased at Plymouth Science Park, Acronyms has a £1.2million turnover and sees growth potential as cyber security becomes even more vital for companies. \nSet up in 2003 Acronyms provides companies across the South West with technical support, IT infrastructure, telephony systems and internet connectivity. \nIt has 14 staff in the South West. Dave Smith, who founded the firm, is managing director with David Parker technical support director. \nMr Smith said: “In the next five years, the importance of cyber security is going to continue growing and this will largely shape the direction both our company and the sector must take. Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now \n“Cyber security is relevant for companies of all sizes, and whereas in the past large numbers of SMEs would ignore cyber security, more and more smaller businesses are starting to take cyber security efforts seriously. \n“The services we provide will have to be installed and configured with security in mind, and, in particular, we expect to be providing a larger number of disaster recovery plans to businesses across the South West. \n“It is not only important for businesses to be secure, but they must be resilient also, to ensure their infrastructure can remain functional shortly after a cyber breach.” \nACTUATE MARKETING \nRoyal William Yard-based Acutate Marketing is looking at the future, when marketing businesses will ultilise virtual reality technology to reach Generation X and Y. \nThe company, a strategic marketing, marketing development, content creation, communication and research company, believes the dual demographic “will become important consumers and price will be a secondary determinant to brand promise”. \nAnd the firm’s Dave Pearce said: “Virtual reality has the capability of challenging how we interact with the web and to disrupt the high street.” \nActuate was set up in 2009 and now employs six people including Bethan Llewellyn Hall, Alison Richards, and Gill Sincock. \nThe business has a turnover of more than £350,000, and specialises in creating strategic positioning and a range of content delivery for clients, straddling conventional and digital channels. \nALTITUDE (Image: Penny Cross) \nThis website design and marketing company was started in 2007 and is now based at Plymouth’s Mount Wise House. \nChief executive Miles Noble said Altitude, which has a turnover of £120,000, collaborates with about 20 “talented people” throughout the South West and UK and said: “Our company is gradually evolving in many different ways and keeping up with the way the web and online marketing is changing is crucial to our success. \n“Websites are now not just more complex from a build perspective – they are also more complex because they exist within a larger ecosystem. \n“Once upon a time your website was your only digital channel. Now we live in a world where the website needs to work alongside social media, mobile, and digital marketing campaigns. \nSutton Harbour Holdings must sell Plymouth airport land to pay off £22m debt \n“This in turn means we need to be even more collaborative in the way we work. \n“With so many people involved in the success of a company’s digital strategy, we can no longer wait until we have finished a design before showing it to others. \n“This is because decisions we make in the design process will have a fundamental impact on what other people are doing. \n“Design decisions will have an impact on the build, the content and how the site integrates with other channels. \n“As the industry matures we need to become better team players.” \nARGANS LTD \nPlymouth’s Argans Ltd specialises in satellite technology to monitor the earth and has a turnover of £1.5million. \nThe earth observation firm, set up in 2007, utilises remote-sensing applications and services, and geographical information systems, to map and monitor the marine, atmospheric and terrestrial environments, maritime boundaries and satellite-derived bathymetry for nautical charting. \nBased at Plymouth Science Park, Argans now has 16 staff, of which five are working in France. \nChief executive is François-Régis Martin-Lauzer, managing director is Jean Laporte and Odile Fanton d’Andon, from parent firm ACRI-ST, is a director. \nA spokesman said: “The company is flexible and dynamic, and, despite its relatively small size and with the support of its parent company ACRI-ST, has worked hard to establish itself in the earth observation sector. \n“It currently contributes to a number of high-profile projects for the European Space Agency and the European Commission.” \nBLUESCREENIT \nFormed in 2004, BluescreenIT is a £700,000-turnover company specialising in the growing field of cyber security. \nThe business, based at One Research Way, Plymouth Science Park, provides training and also runs a Security Operations Centre, performing such tasks as intrusion detection and prevention, and dealing with security breaches. \nWith 18 staff, the firm is headed by managing director Michael Dieroff, business development manager Richard Cashmore, and customer engagement manager Allison Wallace. \nMr Dieroff said: “It is essential our company evolves with the current trends in the fast changing world of IT and cyber security. \n“Our five- year plan is to contribute to the cyber security skills gap and to increase the number of digital apprenticeships in the UK, with a strong focus on regional parts of the UK, all the while ensuring our training is always up to date with the latest technology.” \nHe added: “We feel the use of IT and technology services will continue to immigrate to the cloud. \n“This is down to the ever increasing speed and availability of internet connectivity. \n“This will help with the seamless integration with different technologies and will continue to move us toward a hyper connected and integrated world.” \nBLUESTONE360 LTD (Image: Penny Cross) \nThis creative design and marketing agency works with companies from start ups to corporates and now has a turnover of £1.3million. \nFormed in 1988 by current managing director Stephen Kyffin and Mervyn Orchard, still a director, the business is now based at Plymouth’s Royal William Yard, and employs 16 people. \n“Our focus is delivering brand value to a wide range of clients across many channels and activities,” Mr Kyffin said. “This means we are developing our business towards a more online collaborative model working with specialist providers as demand dictates, especially in the digital area. \n“Increased focus will be on web systems and mobile apps with an emphasis on high-quality tailored solutions. \nB:WEB \nRun by husband-and-wife team Chris and Zoe Ashby b:web specialises in bespoke website development and digital marketing for companies which rely on their web presence to generate leads and sales. \nBased in Plymouth’s Hyde Park Road, the firm was started in 2005 and now has six staff in the city and another three throughout the UK. \n“Generally our clients might have online shops selling B2C or might require lead generation on a B2B basis,” said Mrs Ashby, managing director. \n“We look at forging long terms relationships and our clients usually benefit from continued improvements to their websites, regular development updates and ongoing digital marketing. \n“Initially we focused on selling websites, and in the first couple of years we must have developed hundreds for small businesses. \n“Things were simple then, there was no social media or SEO and Wordpress was just a blogging platform. \n“Over the years we have moved from providing a single service to providing a full service through the recruitment of highly talented individuals. \n“This has allowed us to focus more on the type of customer that we want to work with and to offer them more value. \nCITY SCIENCE \nStart-up software company City Science was founded in 2016 and employs 19 people at Oxygen House at Exeter Business Park. \nIt specialises in analytics that aim to revolutionise the way data about cities is captured and interpreted. \nIt develops software that can help businesses improve operational efficiency, deliver insights and enhance forecasting. \nInitial products support the development of sustainable transport strategies and energy efficiency for buildings and estates. \nCity Science plans to build on its products for sustainable transport and energy efficiency and launch its flagship software providing integrated land, transport and energy modelling. Read More \nLaurence Oakes-Ash, chief executive, said: “We want to provide applications for managing cities; from planning through to monitoring and operation. \n“Our aspiration over the next five years is that data-driven decision making becomes embedded in everything. \n“To achieve that in cities, we need better data at a much lower cost than it can be collected today. We need to store large time-series datasets. We need highly accurate dynamic models and we need to compute multiple potential future states in real-time.” \nHe said that the biggest challenge facing the sector is if organisations behind large scale public projects are not brave enough to embrace new technology. \nHe said: “ That’s a challenge to any technology start-up in the smart city space. They limit the adoption of innovative technology solutions which would otherwise be providing major cost efficiencies. Innovative procurement is an area of focus in the government's Industrial Strategy so we are watching closely to see what new proposals emerge.” \nCOSMIC (Image: Penny Cross) \nThe women behind Devon digital agency Cosmic say that with rapid change comes the increasing threat of cyber security. \nBased at the East Devon Business Centre, Honiton, employing 30 staff and with a turnover of about £750,000 the digital agency and social enterprise prides itself on staying one step ahead. \nJoint chief executives Kate Doodson and Julie Hawker help businesses, individuals and communities to succeed in the digital world by offering IT support, training, website development and digital consultancy. \nIt reinvests earnings into where it will make the most social impact. \nFounded in 1996, the agency has witnessed a rapid increase in the pace of change in the digital sector. \nMs Doodson said: “We are now finding that one of our biggest areas of focus will be on ensuring that businesses, and business leaders, are well equipped to produce a robust digital strategy for the next five years. \n“Artificial intelligence and automation is likely to make the biggest impact. That’s the headline. The sub plot will be the way in which individuals’ rights and data are protected. \n“Our biggest challenge is trying to keep ahead of technological developments. We pride ourselves in leading the way as early adopters of new technologies, so we must always be on top of our game. Additionally, a big threat comes from cyber security and whether society is able to win the war against the criminals. Disruption may become the new norm.” \nCUSTODIAN SOLUTIONS \nSoftware company Custodian Solutions is using its technology to combat dangerous fakes around the globe. \nBased at Exeter Quay, the company employs three in the South West and a further three across the UK. \nCustodian helps companies that produce consumer goods to combat dangerous fakes of their products. It providing tools to support best investigative practices that allow investigators, analysts and lawyers to take safe, appropriate and effective enforcement action. \nFounded in 2013, the company employs six staff and has a turnover of £300,000. \nGary West, Chief Executive and Co-Founder, said that counterfeiting is increasing year on year and there has been interest in the solutions developed by Custodian from large global companies. \nHe said: “Our company is on a tipping point, where many of the largest companies in the world are actively deploying, or looking to deploy our solutions. The more that our platform develops the more powerful a solution it will deliver. It’s a virtuous cycle with the outcome of improving human lives.” \nHe predicts that Machine Learning and AI are likely to become the break-out technologies. He said: “Organisations are already seeing advantages of effective use of those tools. Given appropriate datasets, it is possible to make unique risk and response engines that can quantify and qualify risks. Being able to understand risk is a human weakness. Being able to quantify those risks will change the way we understand the world. We struggle to be able to relate different risks appropriately.” \nDASHBOARD LIMITED \nThe Exeter Science Park-based firm is a technology-based information services provider, using automated remote monitoring for collecting near-real-time data from sensors in remote and accessible locations. \nThe data, is transmitted using satellite/cellular/wireless communications to a “private cloud” platform for analysis and retention. \nAnalysed data is then presented via a “dashboard” visualisation interface, providing a view of the status of the given equipment, process or asset being monitored in real-time. \nDashboard then acquires the data and makes it accessible via any connected device. \nThe technology is applicable to a wide range of industries, but the initial market focus is on oil and gas pipeline infrastructure, including in remote and hostile environments. \nSet up in 2015, the business has eight staff, one based in Scotland, and uses an additional 10 consultants/non-exec directors. \nSenior staff include Piers Corfield, chief executive; Pete Stirling, executive director; Andy Philp, programme manager; and Steve Webber, senior systems architect. Read More South West already set to lead on May's industry agenda \nDashboard became post revenue earlier this year, and the company expects revenues of £500,000 this financial year. \n“The primary mission for the company is to apply industry-leading data analytics across a wide range of industrial processes, all underpinned by a leading-edge cloud-based technology stack designed to sift through data and deliver business intelligence at super computer speed,” a spokesman said. \n“The ability to process industrial information in real-time can then also support proactive preventative maintenance. \n“The applications for this approach are many and varied, and Dashboard has deliberately targeted those sectors with the greatest demand. \n“Far from being a greenfield development, the business has drawn upon proven technologies and applied deep industry know-how and expertise, whilst originating unique intellectual property for the company and its shareholders.” Read More South West offers backing from business in return for investment by the Chancellor \nDENHAMS AUDIO \nPart of Plymouth’s Denham Productions, this is company provides audio production services and was only started in 2017. \nThe Plympton-based company has three staffL Tom Edwards, sound engineer; Grace Kitto, managing director; and Chris Denham, company founder is chief executive. \nMr Denham said the business intends to take on more audio production work for companies in the broadcast and commercial sectors, expanding its client base and audio services. \nHe said technological advancements make the company’s future an exciting one. \n“You will be able to edit people’s voices in a completely new way – it’s called Adobe Voco – which will impact greatly on the recording of voiceovers. \n“You will be able to edit and manipulate anybody’s voice to get them to speak words they have never spoken. \n“It also has the power to help us in broadcast by using it to make last minute pickups or even bring back past voices from the dead.” \nELIXEL (Image: Penny Cross) \nThis mobile application development business was started in 2012 and now has a turnover of £140,000. \nBased in Plymouth, the company has four staff in its Armada Way office. \nGavin Jones is managing director, Becky Veater is financial director, Christian Cook is technical director, and Paul Bird is creative director. \n“With digital becoming the main change factor in many organisations we are already seeing people looking to find ways it can either improve the way they operate their business or completely transform their business model,” Mr Jones said. \n“With more technology reaching consumers, whether it’s virtual reality or virtual assistants, what we define as digital is becoming more and more fragmented and diverse. \n“As a result, we will not only start seeing companies appearing with specific specialisms in VR and audio/voice design we will also start seeing more commercial organisations realising the potential of this technology. \n“Agencies like ours will either have to adapt to the demand brought by this new technology or look at collaboration a mechanism for expanding our capabilities and strengthening our business.” \nHEADFORWARDS \nHeadforwards is the poster boy of Cornwall’s Tech Sector and like other firms in the Duchy it epitomises growth and job creation. \nBased at the Pool Innovation Centre, in the Camborne Pool Redruth Silicon Corridor, the firm, outsource software development company specialises in creating dedicated teams to work on long-term projects in partnership with its clients, in an Agile way. \nLaunched in 2011, it has enjoyed exponential growth since and now employs 102 staff but has plans to double that figure by 2020. \nHeadforwards was set up by Toby Parkins and Craig Girvan in Cornwall because that’s where they live and the two friends wanted to create their company close to home. \nMr Parkins said: “Creating and maintaining a comfortable work-life balance is key to the success of Headforwards. \n“Being in a central location in Cornwall has been the major reason for many of our team who have relocated to work with us from afar. \n“We are a mere five miles from some of the most idyllic coastlines in the world and have are within walking distance of areas of outstanding natural beauty. \n“For many, trading in the daily grind of employment and commuting in the big city for a more relaxed lifestyle and people-focused company culture is a good enough reason to move.” Read More \nAccording to the Tech Nation report 2017, Cornwall has been ranked in the top three UK tech sectors with a tech sector growth potential of 79%. \nIt’s been the same for Headforwards. \nIn the last six years, the firm has grown from a single team of five, to more than 100 staff. \nMr Parkins added: “We are constantly recruiting as our clients increase the requirements of their projects. \n“The tech sector, especially in Cornwall, is thriving.” \nHELM SQUARED \nPerhaps better known as Origin Tickets this Plymouth company provides e-ticketing for the SME market – and estimating it will hit £9million in ticket sales by 2018. \n“Think Eventbrite but better,” said founder Jon Catney. \nHe launched the firm in late 2014, basing it at Plymouth Science Park, where it now has five staff, and is expecting to grow this to 12 by 2018. \nMr Catney is chief executive and Luke Chambers is chief technical officer. \n“The industry we sit in at the moment is fraught with incumbent products that have just gone with the flow and never bothered to innovate on a continual basis due to the size of their empire,” Mr Catney said. \n“They have been funded through the hilt and therefore have huge cash piles to acquire smaller, faster moving, faster reacting businesses. \n“Yet due to their size and willpower to just absorb rather than improve, these industry giants remain at large with feature poor products that are due for a shake-up by new digital businesses that innovate at every turn, that hold customer satisfaction in high regard. \n“Look at disrupters such as Deliveroo, AirBnB, and even our competitor in its younger form, Eventbrite. \n“Our business is due for phenomenal growth over the coming six to 12 months, let alone further down the road. \n“This is because we listen, we innovate and we just crack on with it. \n“We strive to build automation tools to aid with the mundane tasks such as your event administration, amongst other things.” \nIOTEC GLOBAL (Image: Penny Cross) \nIt was only founded in 2013 but iotec Global has grown into a firm with a forecast revenue of £1.3million and 68 staff. \nThe company, based at Plymouth Science Park, marries automated media buying with sophisticated machine learning to deliver digital campaigns for customers. \nWith 46 staff in Plymouth iotec's average annual gross revenue growth rate amounts to 601 per cent growth from March 2016 to March 2017. \nOriginally founded as IO Technologies Group by Raoul Witherall, it is now headed by chief executive Paul Wright. \nEmily Hanson, VP marketing, said:: \"iotec plans to continue to increase brand awareness and take a larger market share by opening European offices (Berlin office opening September 2017), with further global expansion planned next year.” \nLIKE MINDS \nThis £250,000-turnover

Read More How we are making our prosperity wishlist a reality \nMr Ellis said: “We see the potential for enormous growth attracting physical attendees from across the region and nationally as there is no major Ideas Festival in the region with our reach (over 11million across social media channels) and quality of international speakers.” \nAnd he said the imminent arrival of artificial intelligence and virtual reality means “we’ll be able to bring our Ideas Festival to any room in any major city simultaneously.” \nLINK2U \nBased in Liskeard, Cornwall, Link2u provides advertising for small and start up businesses. \nLaunched in April 2015, the business is a one-woman band: Debrah Yeo. \nBut she is ambitious and said: “I see the company employing at least 10 staff and covering all the South West.” \nShe said the biggest challenge she will face is “the ability to communicate all on one platform. Everything will be uniformed.” \nMADE WITH MATURITY (Image: Penny Cross) \nFounded in 2015 by husband and wife team Ben and Clare Stirling, Made with Maturity is a web design and digital marketing business which already has a turnover of £100,000. \nThe Plympton-based firm has four permanent workers, but ultilises a further 22 freelance staff. \nIn total, 21 are in the South West, the other five dotted around the UK. \n“We are seeing the sector becoming more specialist,” Mr Stirling said. “Clients are demanding more intelligent solutions that link across multiple areas of their business with different technologies. \n“As the tools for digital marketing become more sophisticated, so too do the teams working on these technologies need to become more specialist. \n“At Made with Maturity we work in collaboration with digital technology specialists, to provide intelligent solutions for our customers. \n“We are not a generic design agency who provide a generic service, we create teams that are bespoke, to fit a client’s need. \n“In the next five years we will continue to grow our network of collaborators to meet the demands of the changing digital landscape.” \nMAGICKA INTERACTIVE LTD \nThis IT consultancy specialises in working in the education sector and now has a turnover of £150,000. \nStarted in 2002, and now based in the Genesis Business Centre, in Plymouth’s Union Street, it employs five people including \nSteve Kemsley, managing director, and Keith Burtt, head of technical services. \nMr Kemsley said: “We expect to see large growth in our sector (education cloud).” \nHe predicted the invent of artificial intelligence (AI) assistants, for medical diagnosis and analysis of patterns. \nAnd he said the biggest challenge facing his company will be persuading educators to “abandon decades of existing practice to move to a better, cheaper more effective platform for reasons only known to them”. \nOWEN JONES DESIGN \nThis creative brand and communication design specialists was founded by the eponymous Owen Jones in 2010. \nBased in Plymouth’s Mount Wise House business hub, it may have only two staff members but has vast growth ambitions. \n“The business aims to grow organically in the coming years, both in personnel, slowly moving towards an optimum level of four to five people, but more in terms of local and national reach,” Mr Jones said. \n“We want to gain recognition for excellent work, of course, but the main vision is to build foundations for a sustainable business that we continue to enjoy coming into on a Monday morning and that delivers effective and inspiring work for its clients. \n“In terms of the sector, that's trickier. I’d love to see more top-level brand and design consultancies thriving in Plymouth as it would communicate the need for good design as part of any business strategy within the community and lead to excellent growth opportunities. \n“Around the country and in the city the industry continues to thrive. \n“Exceptionally talented new students are constantly coming through the education system and larger agencies are splitting down to more manageable sized and flexible creative consultancies – often as few as one or two people as opposed to multiple teams of staff.” \nPIXALYTICS LTD (Image: Paul Slater) \nPixalytics Ltd is a satellite remote sensing company working in the space sector – a field more commonly known as “Earth observation” \nThere are about 1,500 active satellites orbiting the planet and a quarter of these collect data about what is happening on Earth. \nThe Plymouth Science Park-based firm downloads this data and processes it to create information for clients about the behaviour and resources on the Earth. \nExamples include flood maps; information about soil and crop health; and data about what is happening in rivers, reservoirs and the oceans. \nThe company as formed in 2012 by Dr Sam Lavender and her husband Andrew Lavender, and now has a staff of five and a turnover of £130,000.

The internet of things will be central. However, more than simply connecting humans with devices, the next stage in connectivity will include “humanised” interfaces that constantly evolve to understand the user’s patterns and needs and, in a sense, self-optimise.” \nSLINGSHOT 6 \nWith a staff of three and a turnover of £250,000, the bulk of contracts are in providing rapid temporary or long term internet for remote events, events or on the move in vehicles.

We already sell products and services in Europe, America and Australasia, and plan to increase our reach to both global audiences as well as further saturation of the UK as we roll out new national and international.” \nSPONGE UK \nIt’s become one of the success stories if Plymouth by winning a clutch of awards in recent years and in 2017 Sponge UK’s founder has been lionised as Entrepreneur of the Year. \nLouise Pasterfield founded the Plymouth Science Park based e-earning company and has seen it grow to the stage where it has more than 80 workers. \nSponge UK creates custom-made online training for global organisations including GlaxoSmithKline, Toyota, Coca-Cola, Tesco, Google and the United Nations. \nBetween 2011 and 2016, the company grew more than eight fold to reach a turnover of more than £3million. \nLast year Ms Pasterfield raised a glass when Sponge UK earned a spot as one of the best places to work in the country in a leading workplace study published by the Sunday Times. \nMs Pasterfield was name Plyouth’s top entrepreneur at a glittering Pavilions shindig in 2017.
