After yet more tragic deaths on the road politicians of all colours have lent their support to the campaign - We Need it Now. The campaign calls for a timetable to be put together so North Devon residents can have confidence in the programme of delivery of Â£250m improvements. \nYesterday a mother and two children from Milton Keynes were killed near the West Buckland junction after a head-on collision with a Marks & Spencer lorry. It came just 24 hours after a person was left with life-threatening injuries after an accident nearby. \nBecause the road was \"de-trunked\" over a decade ago it is no longer managed by the Highways Agency and Devon County Council has to go through a lengthy process of applying for Government money to affect change.

What's worrying those who have campaigned long and hard for the improvements is that there is no set timetable in place for the improvements and with Brexit and internal wrangling there are plenty of distractions in Westminster. \nCounty Councillor Brian Greenslade campaigned against the original design for the North Devon Link Road in the late 1970s and 1980s. He told DevonLive.com that he had always felt the design encouraged dangerous overtaking. \n\"This tragic accident just proves once again that it's a killer road,\" the Barnstable Lib Dem said. \n\"People argue that it's bad driving but the design of the carriageway that just leads to people driving more dangerously than they would on a properly dualled road.
