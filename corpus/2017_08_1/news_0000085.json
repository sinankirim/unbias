When he found out about the ‘C’ word (in Tory speak) on her back, he apparently found it very hard indeed to ‘Calm down’. \nMs Edwards posted the photograph on Instagram and reportedly said: “Couldn’t have even planned it. \n“Big Dave C in the house, shame he can’t read.” \nShe later wrote: “He was so mad when he saw me walk off with what was on my back.” \nIt was not so long ago - May, 2015 to be precise - he was seen as the golden boy of politics who was to head a Tory revolution for the next decade. \nAt the general election of that month he led the Tories to an unexpected majority. The North groaned in dismay at the thought of everlasting austerity. Read More What did David Cameron ever do for the North East? Here are 10* things \nHowever the means which helped him achieve the victory - the promise of an EU referendum - sowed the seeds of what was to come. \nAs a result, the man with the Midas touch politically has seen his mythical talents reversed. Which brings me neatly to the latest episode. \nTo cap a fine couple of weeks for the former Tory leader came the richly symbolic event at the end of this week. \nHe was spotted enjoying a dip in the Cornish sea on his holiday. Nothing wrong with that. \nHowever on the day he braved the waves, lifeguards put out a red flag warning, telling holidaymakers not to go in the water because there was a spillage of raw, untreated sewage. \nSo, he might have been literally swimming in...well, you get the picture. And not a very pretty one at that. Like us on Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-08-12T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-08-12T18:25:40.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
