It was only saved after a local campaign. \nMeanwhile Mrs May displayed that irritating ability to answer questions that haven’t been asked. \nShe seemed to misinterpret one about how it will be different under her government after seven years of austerity under previous Tory administrations as ‘how great will you be for the North East?’ \nIs this the sort of person who can cope with the vexatious Brexit negotiations to come without putting her hands over her ears and chanting ‘la la la’ when someone disagrees with her? \nOr for that matter has she the gumption to deal with a country currently beset by crisis on all fronts, economically, in health and social care, housing, poverty, you name it, it’s broken and needs fixing. \nI sometimes wonder if Mrs May is actually aware of these problems as she seems to exist in an hermetically sealed bubble in which the only sound is Gary Barlow’s latest hit ‘Strong and Stable’ being played over and over and over again. \nWorse than that we have reached the point of a moral crisis and the wrong party is in charge. Prime Minister Theresa May takes part in a Q&A during a general election (Photo: PA) \nSince 2010 we’ve been told repeatedly first by the Tory-led Coalition and then since 2015 the Tory government on its own that austerity was the only way to get the UK back on the move again. \nAnd how the country has suffered since then, not least here in the North. \nYet, seven years on, there is no end in sight and it looks like another five years if May gets the keys to Number 10. \nIf we’re in such dire straits, how come last week it was revealed the country has never had as many billionaires as it does now. \nIt was also reported last week that 35 of the richest 100 people in Britain donated £19m to the Tories. Read More \nDoes this explain why there has not been any mention as yet by Mrs May of her Tory team of tapping into this extraordinary wealth to help ease some of the social privations the UK is undergoing? \nOne of the many criticisms of the May campaign is she won’t speak to the public. \nThat’s not strictly true. If you want to speak to her, you can - if you’ve got £50k to spare. £50k a year that is as for that you can become a member of The Leader’s Group, the premier supporter Group of the Conservative Party. \nGetting Mrs May’s ear is as easy as first time buyers getting on the property ladder. Impossible if you haven’t got serious cash. Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-05-13T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-05-13T18:12:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
