I finally started mine last year. \n“I’ve wanted to do that for five years but I never felt I was quite ready. I’d read all the books, I’ve got great friends who are entrepreneurs but I still didn’t feel it was quite the right time for me.

What we’re trying to do in this week is put on a plate in five days the sort of thing you need to know to start a business that would normally take you five weeks or five months to learn. \n“Newcastle Start-Up Week is a great showcase for all the great support that exists in the North East to help people start up their own business.” \nNewcastle Start-Up Week is being supported by a range of organisations including the North East LEP, computing firm Sage, the Federation of Small Businesses, Invest Newcastle, and regional technology groups Dynamo, Digital Union and Sunderland Software City. \nHigh profile professional services companies including blusky chartered accountants, Northstar Ventures, Muckle LLP, KPMG, RBS, Stellium Data Centres, Zerolight and Filamanet PR have also provided sponsorship.

Speakers include Newcastle City Council chief executive Pat Ritchie, best-selling author Brad Burton and Government business advisor Tony Robinson. \nAlso speaking at the launch event was Newcastle Central MP and Shadow Minister for Industrial Strategy Chi Onwurah, who praised the event’s organisers.

That isn’t how I usually spend my time and it’s great to see so many people who are so determined to fulfill their dreams and also start something which can grow and contribute to the success of our city.” \nMore details on this week’s events can be found at https://newcastlestartupweek.com/ .
