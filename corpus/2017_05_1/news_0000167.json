They also begged us not to stand in Leicester West because it would help them beat Liz Kendall but we are fighting that one.\" \nMr Sprason said that decision was in part down to the anger among local UKIP members at comments made by Conservative county council leader Nick Rushton after UKIP lost their two seats at County Hall in Thursday's election. \nMr Rushton described the UKIP two members, including Mr Sprason, as an anomaly and said he was glad they had lost. their seats. \nMr Sprason added: \"We fought long and hard about Loughborough and South Leicestershire where Nicky Morgan and Alberto Costa were anti-Brexit but they have changed their minds.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-05-08T00:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-05-07T19:31:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
