I will help strengthen the Prime Minister's hand at the negotiating table, and will work to make a success of Brexit locally. I strongly urge his candidate to publicly reject Open Britain's rhetoric and back democracy.\" \nMs Kendall insisted she was now simply intent on getting the best Brexit deal for the UK. \nShe said: \"Unfortunately the Conservatives haven't bothered to check the facts. \n\"I voted to trigger Article 50 in Parliament and begin the process of leaving the EU. \n\"I will continue to campaign for the best possible Brexit deal for jobs, businesses and families in this area. \n\"The real question is whether my Tory opponent will do the same and fight for the people of Leicester West, or just accept whatever deal the country is given.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-05-19T22:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-05-19T19:58:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
