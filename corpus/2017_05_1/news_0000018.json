By danjmartin   2 COMMENTS SHARES The Fernie Hunt in Great Bowden, Sir Alan Duncan, Micheal Mullaney and Jewel Miah What do Leicestershire General Election candidates think about the fox hunting...   Comments (2) \nPrime minister Theresa May's promise to allow an MPs a free vote on whether to end the ban on fox-hunting has split opinion between Leicestershire's General Election candidates. \nThe Conservative leader, a supporter of fox-hunting, has said if she leads the next Government she will offer Parliament the opportunity to repeal the 2004 law which made hunting with hounds illegal. \nThere are five hunts that ride in Leicestershire, the Quorn, Atherstone, Fernie, Cottesmore and Belvoir, and the county has strong historic links with fox-hunting. \nMrs May's comments on the matter in the run up to June 8 have re-opened the bitter debate between the pro and anti-hunt lobbies. General Election 2017: Click HERE for everything you need to know \nTory Rutland and Melton election candidate Sir Alan Duncan is a staunch supporter of hunting and said it was perfectly fine to offer MPs a free vote on repealing the ban. \nHe said: \"That is exactly what parliament is for. \n\"It needs somebody to bring a bill but with a constituency like mine I would vote for it. \n\"There was never any need for a ban in the first place. If you don't like fox-hunting don't do it.\" \nBosworth Liberal Democrat candidate Michael Mullaney said: \"Do we really need to be dragging this issue up again? \n\"Years ago it took up so much parliamentary time. \n\"Personally I'm opposed to fox-hunting and I think the law is fine as it is. \n\"There are important issues in rural areas, the lack of buses, shops, pubs and other facilities. \n\"Those are real issues. \n\"I can count on one hand the number of people who have raised this as an issue. \n\"It's just a distraction.\" \nJewel Miah is the Labour parliamentary candidate for Loughborough. \nHe said: \"The law was changed in 2004. It's nowtime to leave this barbaric action behind. \n\"It is unbecoming of society to be chasing down and killing foxes with dogs. \n\"With all the pressing issues in the world at the moment the Tories want to talk about this. \n\"The next Government will have its hands full with the Brexit negotiations. \n\"Hopefully it will be a Labour Government so we can forget this silly nonsense about ending the ban on fox-hunting.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-05-10T20:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-05-10T18:31:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
