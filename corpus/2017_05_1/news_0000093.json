In 2016, they stood at £403.80, an £8 a week drop or a £419 annual fall. \nThe TUC predicts that things could get worse, with the Bank of England warning that real earnings will fall for the rest of 2017. \nIt also said a big increase of people in “insecure employment” like zero hours contracts is helping to push down living standards. \nTUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said: \n“Workers in the North East are over £400 a year worse off than before the crash. \n“This region badly needs a pay rise. It’s nearly 10 years since the financial crisis, and working people are still suffering. \n“Politicians have to explain to voters how they’ll create decent jobs that people can actually live on. \n“And there needs to be recognition of the damage pay restrictions in the public sector are having. Hard-working nurses shouldn’t have to use food banks to get by.” \nQuoting Office for National Statistics figures, the TUC says that of the 59,788 growth in jobs since 2011, 39,816 are classed as ‘insecure’, 67% of the total. International Tom Eden 80 killed in Afghanistan attack \nThe death toll in the suicide car bomb attack on Kabul’s diplomatic zone has risen to 80, an Afghan health official said. (Photo: AP) \nThe target of the attack was not immediately known but that most of the casualties were civilians, including women and children, Mr Kawasi said. \nNo group immediately claimed responsibility for Wednesday’s explosion, which struck the heart of Kabul’s highly secure diplomatic district, the Wazir Akbar Khan area. \nThe neighbourhood is home to several embassies and not far from the Presidential Palace and foreign ministry. \nGerman and Pakistani authorities have said some of their employees and staff were hurt in the explosion. General Election Tom Eden Future of NHS and schools 'anything but strong and stable' \nThe future of the NHS and English schools are “at stake” in the General Election, Jeremy Corbyn has said, as he attempted to steer the campaign away from Brexit and onto Labour’s favoured battleground of the public services. \nThe Labour leader turned Theresa May’s election slogan against her, claiming that after seven years of Conservative-led administrations, the state of health, social care and education were “anything but strong and stable”. \nFive more years of Tory government would be “disastrous” for public services, while Labour would be willing to ask the richest to pay “a little bit more” to fund them, he said. \nMr Corbyn’s decision to go on the attack over public services comes after Mrs May attempted to force the campaign focus onto her core messages of leadership and Brexit, saying the Labour leader was unprepared for crunch Brexit talks within days of the General Election and would find himself “alone and naked” in negotiations. \nLabour’s analysis claims that under Tory plans, 5.5 million people will find themselves on NHS waiting lists in England by 2022, the scheduled end of the next parliament, a 1.8 million increase from now. Northumberland Council Tom Eden 'It's ludicrous' \nA petition has been launched calling for controversial plans to introduce five local area councils in Northumberland to be scrapped. Map of the proposed five local area councils in Northumberland (Photo: Northumberland County Council) \nNorthumberland County Council approved plans to create the bodies in North Northumberland, Ashington and Blyth, Castle Morpeth, Tynedale and Cramlington and Bedlington, last week. \nUnder the proposals, towns and villages will be represented by five councils and each will be responsible for issues such as planning applications, road spending and petitions. \nCouncil leader Peter Jackson said the move would bring decision making back to local people.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-05-31T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-05-31T09:15:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
