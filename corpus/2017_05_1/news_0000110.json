The chain has hundred of stores in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong , Malaysia and more than 40 in the UK despite only entering the British market in 2013. \nThat was after the group's net profit after tax rose to 174.5million Australian dollars. \nThe firm has become well known for its use of bold colours and quirky graphics on branded products, such as bags, pencil cases and books. \nAnd it has brought an aggressive growth agenda to the UK aiming to open 200 UK stores by 2019, with projected annual sales of £114million. \nIn 2016 Smiggle UK reported sales of £29.07million, up 180 per cent on the £10.2million reported the previous year. \nIt also announced pre-tax profit of £3.82million, compared to £641,000 in 2015. \nAt a time when high street retailer have been suffering from pressures from online, plus rising inflation and constrained disposable incomes, Smiggle has thrived. \nIt estimated the annual personal stationery market in the UK is worth about £1.5billion and intends to take a large bite out of it. \nSmiggle's entry into the mall coincides with the arrival of top food chain Bill's, which will open in the unit vacated by Ed's Easy Diner before the end of 2017. \nMeanwhile, the huge property firm which owns Drake Circus mall, and a massive chunk of the city centre, has announced it made £390million profit in the past year \nBut British Land Company plc, which is also behind plans for a £40million cinema complex at Bretonside, said also warned of a post-Brexit \"uncertain environment\". \nChris Grigg, British Land's chief executive, said rising inflation, coupled with disposable incomes being tightened, will hit stores' profits.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-05-19T15:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-05-19T11:42:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
