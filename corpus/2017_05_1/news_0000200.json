The story here is that Labour has suffered and UKIP no longer has any representation on the council so it is down to us to make sure we continue to hold the Tories to account. \n\"They will be back cutting services again soon and we all know that.\" \nLabour suffered a reverse in Leicestershire losing three of the nine seats they held. \nThe Tories took a major scalp by unseating Labour group leader Robert Sharp from his seat in Loughborough South. Police and crime commissioner Willy Bach on today's poll results \nMr Sharp said: \"I am personally disappointed but we saw it coming. \n\"I have said before that it has been tough on the doorstep we have struggled to get local issues noticed. \n\"All we have had back at us is Brexit and 'Bloody Corbyn'. \n\"I don't want to sound like a bitter candidate who has just lost his seat and is trying to blame someone else but we can't hide behind it any more. \n\"It's a fact Jeremy Corbyn has had a negative impact on us in this campaign.\" \nUKIP lost both of their seats to the Conservatives. \nFormer UKIP councillor for Markfield Desford and Thornton David Sprason said: \"We have suffered locally because of the national picture.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-05-05T23:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-05-05T23:10:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
