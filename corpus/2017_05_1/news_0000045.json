In 2016, they stood at £403.80, an £8 a week drop or a £419 annual fall. \nThe TUC predicts that things could get worse, with the Bank of England warning that real earnings will fall for the rest of 2017. \nIt also said a big increase of people in “insecure employment” like zero hours contracts is helping to push down living standards. TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady (Photo: Daily Mirror) \nTUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said: “Workers in the North East are over £400 a year worse off than before the crash. \n“This region badly needs a pay rise. It’s nearly 10 years since the financial crisis, and working people are still suffering. \n“Politicians have to explain to voters how they’ll create decent jobs that people can actually live on. \n“And there needs to be recognition of the damage pay restrictions in the public sector are having. Hard-working nurses shouldn’t have to use food banks to get by.” Read More Thousands of zero hour contract workers paid £1,000 a year less than staff in the same jobs \nQuoting Office for National Statistics figures, the TUC says that of the 59,788 growth in jobs since 2011, 39,816 are classed as ‘insecure’, 67% of the total. \nThe TUC estimates that 124,000 people now work in insecure jobs in the region – up from 84,000 in 2011. That represents one in nine workers in the North East.
