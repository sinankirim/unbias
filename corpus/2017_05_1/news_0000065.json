X \nCopy link to paste in your message / Comments (1) \nWhen Totnes Conservative Club was one of the buildings targeted by a man who covered various buildings in the town with politically motivated graffiti, they decided to make the best of a bad situation. \nMany prominent buildings were targeted in the attack including Totnes Conservative Club upon which 'Choose the Tories on June 8th for 5 more years of Tor(y)ment' was written. Most of the graffiti has been covered now, but the Conservative Club decided not to cover all of the graffiti on the side of their building; but simply amend it to just 'Choose the Tories on June 8 th '. \nPolice released a CCTV image of the man believed to be responsible for the series of politically motivated graffiti messages. No arrests have yet been made, and the incidents are still under investigation. \nBelow the message on the Totnes Conservative Club, the graffiti artist then wrote 'P.S. Redo your roof. It's s**t to work on!' This has since been painted over. \nThe incident happened in the early hours of May 9 with officers tracking down a man with a spray can on Station Road. Despite an hour long pursuit police were unable to catch the offender. \nA police spokesman said: \"During the early hours of Tuesday, May 9, the male pictured was responsible for a host of acts of graffiti, targeting prominent walls in the town centre in order to portray his anti-government ideals. \n\"In doing so, he defaced many ancient and historic buildings, many of which are privately owned. The Conservative Club was specifically targeted. \n\"This most recent series of graffiti has caused considerable upset amongst local residents, particularly as one resident had only just finished painting over the last act of vandalism to his property. \n\"At least one of these acts was witnessed, but that witness did not call the police. \n\"At around 4.10am last night, a male wearing a face scarf, latex gloves and carrying a spray can was seen by police on patrol on Station Road. \n\"The male made off through private gardens and despite an hour long track by a police dog unit, the male was not located.\" \nIf you have any information, contact the police via 101, Crimestoppers or on the Totnes Police Facebook page quoting log 72 of May 9.
