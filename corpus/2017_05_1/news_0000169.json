It's what she wanted. \nInstead, she escaped with a broken pelvis and numerous other broken bones. \n\"As I was being taken to hospital, two policemen were knocking on my door and breaking the news to my husband,\" she said. \nOn the face of it, Gill had been \"living the dream\" in Devon, after moving west with her husband and children in search of a better quality of life. But living the dream did not go quite according to plan, she told the TedX Exeter audience at the Northcott Theatre. \nGill became severely depressed. \"I just seemed to shut down,\" she said. \nAt night she would lie awake from 1am. By sunrise, she would be \"disgusted that I still existed. I convinced myself that my family would be better off without me,\" she said. \nShe thought about suicide a lot, and half tried it a number of times. On the fateful night in 2013 she went all the way. \nEvery day in Britain, 17 people succeed in committing suicide, and 17 families have \nto come to terms with the loss, she told an audience of 900 in the theatre on the University of Exeter campus and some 10,000 around the world. \nHer recovery took off thanks to the messages that flooded in – and in particular a knitted bookmark from her daughter's ten-year-old classmate, George. The bookmark carried one word: \"Hope\". \nYet official help was slow to come. She waited two and a half years on the NHS waiting list for psychotherapy. \"Despite Government promises, mental health services have struggled with years of under-funding,\" she said. \nBy sharing her story of recovery, Gill aims to spread hope to others with depression, to challenge some of the beliefs around mental illness and to encourage us to all to play a role in the mental-health revolution. \n\"Depression isn't a weakness or a character flaw,\" she said. \"It's an illness. People can learn to recognise depression so that early intervention will prevent it escalating. \n\"Challenge stigma. Even today, well-meaning friends refer to this episode as 'my accident',\" she said. \"Tell it like it is.\" Confession: I was a would-be jihadist \n\"For the first 16 years of my childhood, I just wanted to sacrifice my life in jihad,\" a Pakistani woman confessed to a Westcountry audience. \nGulalai Ismail was one of the speakers at the TedX Exeter event at the Northcott Theatre in Exeter. \nAn audience of 900 listened in stunned silence as Gulalai described her early years in a remote Pakistani village, where most of the young people were being groomed for a life of holy war. \nShe was saved by her father's pacifist beliefs. \nThe family fled the village, and Gulalai went on to found Aware Girls with her sister, Saba. \nDriven by a passion to challenge a culture of intolerance and extremism, Gulalai and Saba began running workshops in their home town to provide girls and young women with leadership skills to challenge oppression and fight for their rights to an education and equal opportunities. \nTheir youth-based network, they believe, has since saved the lives of 10,000 young people, who have been steered away from violent jihad. \n\"So many places in the world are ripe for radicalisation,\" she warned. \"Extremist violence knows no borders.\" \nLast year 2016 Aware Girls was awarded the Chirac Peace Prize. \nThe TedX event was broadcast live around the country and the world, with more than 10,000 people registered to watch online. Disabled teen refugee's tale of nightmare trip to safety \nA teenage Syrian refugee in a wheelchair won a standing ovation. \nNujeen Mustafa, who has cerebral palsy and cannot walk, braved the Mediterranean in search of an education and medical treatment. \nGrowing up in Syria, Nujeen was unable to go to school. She learned English by watching American television programmes while stuck in a fifth-floor Aleppo apartment without a lift \"which made hanging out a bit difficult\". \nWhen civil war broke out Nujeen and her family joined thousands of displaced people. \n\"Before I realised it, I was on that rubber dinghy. We were the happiest people on earth.\" \nShe described the challenges of adapting to a new life in Germany – from learning the language to adapting to eating with a knife and fork when traditionally she had used a spoon. \nShe tells her story in a new book, The Girl from Aleppo, co-authored by Christina Lamb, chief foreign correspondent at The Sunday Times, who also spoke at the event. Ms Lamb, who has been a reporter for 30 years, said: \"Over the past year I have seen worse things than ever before.\" \nBut she said she carried on with her work as a war correspondent, because \"it's in the darkest skies that you find the brightest stars\". \n\"To me, women are the real heroes of war,\" she said. \"They are the ones who feed, protect and shelter their children.\" \nVirginie Helias, global sustainability brand director at consumer goods multinational \nProcter & Gamble, highlighted the damage being done to the seas by discarded plastics. \nShe is a pioneer of using big brands to drive change. \"Procter & Gamble products have been part of the problem, and we want them to be part of the solution,\" she said. \nThe company has produced a limited edition of the best-selling Head & Shoulders shampoo in bottles made from plastics found on beaches. \nThe event included performances from the Devon drumming collective Kagemusha Taiko and Plymouth-based dance company Street Factory. This is TEDxExeter's 6th annual ideas festival. Tickets for the 900-strong event sold out in minutes. Comment: Keith Rossiter … How to make your voice heard by listening \nIt's not the despair I mind so much… it's the hope, John Cleese said, as he battled to overcome fate's persistent obstacles in the movie Clockwork. \nIf ever we've needed hope, it's now. \nLife must have been worse for Europeans caught up in the Second World War, but at least in Britain they had a common cause to unite behind, and leaders with the power to inspire. \nEntire generations will have gone by not knowing a society as divided or even falling apart as it is now. \nWhat started with the banking crisis in 2008 has ended up with Brexit, the health and social care services in crisis, and welfare payments being slashed. \nIt's possible to make a case to defend quantitative easing that made bankers richer and the rest of us poorer. \nHalf the country will be delighted about Brexit, that's inevitable about any democratic vote. What's unusual is the depth of despair felt by the other half. \nPeople have always moaned about abuse of welfare, so the Conservatives must have thought that reforming the system was a certain winner.
