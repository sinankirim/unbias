More than half (52%) of firms want this to be a Government priority. \nThe FSB represents hundreds of small firms in the North East and has become an increasingly powerful voice with the Government after remaining neutral during the Brexit referendum. \nBut the organisation clashed with Ministers earlier this year after moves in the Budget to change tax rates for the self-employed, a move that was eventually dropped. \nTed Salmon, FSB regional chairman in the North East, said: “We’ve heard promising noises over the last few years about the Northern Powerhouse and an ambitious Industrial Strategy. \n“The new Government must take the opportunity to fully deliver on these initiatives. Our members are at the heart of the economy, so it must think small first if it wants that delivery to be a success.

We need to see the next Government simplify the tax system, raise the Employment Allowance and freeze fuel duty to help them combat cost pressures. \n“Then there’s the entrepreneurial army of self-employed workers, now 4.8m strong. The next Government must rule out any tax grab on these strivers and reform the social security system so they receive the fair treatment they deserve.” \nAccording to the FSB research, the largest concerns for small firms in the North East for the coming five years are increasing taxes, rising business costs and the regulatory burden.
