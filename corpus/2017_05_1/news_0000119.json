Head teachers, parents and school staff have led protests about funding cuts which one local head said would see school budgets 'falling off a cliff'. \nExperts predict that hundreds of teaching jobs will be lost, class sizes will increase and subjects will disappear from the curriculum as schools struggle to cope with the government's funding formula. The subject was raised during an election hustings event organised by the Newton Abbot Chamber of Trade at the town's University Technical College. \nAnne Marie Morris, the sitting MP for the town, told the audience: \"I'm aware of some of the challenges going on in some of our schools. I'm distraught at some of the things that I see. We need a fair funding formula. \n\"What you currently see in terms of offering is not what Theresa May will be delivering post-election.\" \n\"I understand the pain, and it is something that must be fixed. All the Devon MPs are united in making sure that she does deliver.\" \nREAD MORE: Theresa May rallies Devon voters as one opinion poll warns she might lose \nMs Morris joined Labour candidate James Osben and Liberal Democrat Marie Chadwick to answer questions at the hustings. Mr Osben told the meeting: \"Labour will ensure that no child is left behind, and all schools are fully funded.\" \nMrs Chadwick added: \"The funding formula needs reworking. It is now time for us to unite, because this is a massive issue across the South West. We will make sure that nobody loses out.\" \nREAD MORE: Why you should ask your election candidates how they plan to save schools \nAn audience of around 50 people took part in the debate, and the three candidates answered questions on supporting local businesses. They were asked if leaving the European Single Market made economic or business sense. \n\"I'm not sure that it does,\" said Mr Osben. \"I think we are in very treacherous water. Leaving the EU with no deal, and not having access to the free market is possibly the worst possible deal we could have for Britain.\" \nREAD MORE: This is the full list of candidates standing in Devon \nMrs Chadwick added: \"No, it doesn't make sense. I think it's a crackers idea. Getting out of the single market is an enormously bad idea.\" \nBut Ms Morris told the meeting: \"I think Brexit is brilliant for business. There are more opportunities outside the EU than inside. We need to have our hands untied so we can do free trade deals with other countries in the world.\" Polling stations open in Countdown \nThe candidates were also asked what more could be done to encourage young people to vote. \nMrs Chadwick said she backed lowering the voting age to 16 and added: \"Sometimes we get lost in the great issues of state and young people don't feel that that affects them. We've got to engage very much more, and we need to be seen to be working together more.\" \nMs Morris said the government and the teaching profession needed to do more to make politics accessible and Mr Osben said it was important to engage people in schools earlier. \nHe added: \"This General Election is absolutely critical. It's important for all of us. There is a lot of apathy out there, and it is upsetting that people feel so disenfranchised.\" \nKathryn Driscoll of the Green Party is also standing in the Newton Abbot constituency.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-05-31T16:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-05-31T17:04:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
