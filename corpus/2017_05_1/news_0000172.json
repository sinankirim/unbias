Peter McCusker reports. \nOne of the energy industry’s leading figures says 2017 will be ‘the turning point for the sector’. \nSpeaking on Teesside, Stuart Broadley, CEO of the Energy Industries Council (EIC), said: “After three years of crisis many of our members are seeing green shots with the levels of enquiries going up again. \n“With oil in the region of $45 to $55 a barrel, and following years of significant cost improvements, projects are now becoming viable and if that remains the case we will see projects going in 2018.” \nMr Broadley was speaking at the launch of the EIC’s new insight report; ‘Survive & Thrive’ which features input from 120 member companies, and in-depth findings from interviews with 26 EIC members - including a few from the North East. \nNot one of the 26 companies mentioned any concerns over the forthcoming Brexit , and in a world where the UK will need to open up new markets, Mr Broadly highlighted one worrying finding from its research. \nIn the months and years that followed the oil price crash which started three years ago, only 8% turned to exporting. \nMr Broadley said: “We are very surprised by the findings it seemed the companies we have spoken to decided it would be too difficult to embark on an export drive in the situation they were finding themselves in. \n“Instead they decided it would be more worthwhile to invest in new technology and collaborate. \n“They decided exporting was too expensive, and too risky, and they chose to work with their core customers and innovate. \n“This is quite worrying as all the Government seems to care about as we approach Brexit is exporting, and this says it is not going to work. \n“British businesses aren’t resourced or able to invest in that two or three-year cycle themselves and are instead focusing on the UK and that creates future risk. The companies have a very short-term view right now of what they have to do to survive.” \nMr Broadley suggested the government consider re-instating the TAP fund for SMEs , which exhibit abroad. It would allow SMEs access to finance to attend shows like the annual Offshore Technology Conference, which took place in Houston last week. \nMr Broadley said there needed to be more promotion around the UK Export Finance, which supplies companies with bonds and guarantees as they trade around the world. \nHe believes the apparent lack of concern over Brexit was a reflection on the immediacy of the on-going issues they face, but as the date of leaving the EU draws closer it will feature more prominently in business planning. \nHowever the supply chain’s drive to collaborate and innovate has produced some notable results, said Mr Broadley. \nFor many years supply chain companies have been left frustrated by the aloofness of operators and tier one suppliers - the ‘race to be second’ is how supply chain executives dub this.

It has 600 members including North Shields company Elfab. Established in 1936, Elfab specialises in pressure management solutions. \nPrior to the 2014 downturn, 35% of the company’s sales were linked to the oil and gas sector, but this share has now been reduced to around 15% on annual sales of £10m. \nIt has diversified into chemicals and pharmaceuticals and now presents itself as a solutions provider. \nElfab sales director Philip Fedosenkov said: “Elfab’s brand is now well established as a pressure management solutions expert and not just a components manufacturer. \n“By understanding our customers’ applications, operational requirements and business objectives we better positioned ourselves to offer a complete pressure management solution not just a pressure relief product to our global customer base.” \nMr Broadley remains optimistic predicting much better times ahead for the offshore supply chain. He said: “Every single one of the 26 businesses I’ve talked to has recently seen an increase in enquiries and orders.” \nFollow Peter McCusker on Twitter @mccusker60 Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-05-11T02:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-05-10T21:48:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
