Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThe victory of Emmanuel Macron in the French presidential race could have a big impact on the North East. \nMr Macron, 39, won almost 66% of the vote against his far right opponent Marine Le Pen. \nThroughout his very pro-EU campaign the former finance minister pitched himself as a direct alternative to Marine Le Pen’s anti-immigrant, nationalist rhetoric and dismissed her calls for a ‘Frexit’ referendum. \nIn his election manifesto Mr Macron described Britain’s decision to leave the EU as a “crime” which will leave the UK facing “servitude”. \nHe is in favour of a hard Brexit that would leave the EU outside of the single market and has stressed the importance of defending the EU’s freedoms of movement and trade. \nEarlier this year he said in an interview with Channel 4: “If your Government decides to organise a Brexit, I will be pretty tough on it. \n“We have to preserve the rest of the European Union and not to convey the message that you can decide to leave without any consequences.” \nThis could raise even more doubts about the long term future of Nissan on Wearside and whether it remains in the region. Emmanuel Macron (Photo: AP Photo/Thibault Camu) \nThe French government has a 20% stake in the car maker. \nMr Macron has also previously vowed to renegotiate the Le Touquet agreement which keeps British border controls in Calais, raising the prospect of a Jungle camp moving to Kent. \nAnother effect of Mr Macron’s victory is on the possible future of UK politics and in particular the Labour party. \nHe is seen by New Labour loyalists as a sort of Gallic Tony Blair and might consider copying his blueprint. \nMr Macron only formed the party En Marche! (‘on the move’, in English) last year and they might be inspired to form their own party on the back of it and break away from Labour. \nIf the opinion polls are correct - and if the local election results are carried into the general election - the Labour party faces huge losses.
