UKIP came second with 13.2 per cent and Labour came third with 12.8 per cent while the Lib Dems fourth. \nSpeaking after his re-adoption to fight the seat Mr Stride said: \"I am delighted to have been reselected by local party members to fight Central Devon and I have already been out campaigning right across our vast constituency speaking with local residents, listening to their concerns and discussing how a future Conservative government is best placed to deliver positively on Brexit. \n\"The choice at this election is clear - a Conservative majority government led by Theresa May focused on getting the best possible deal from the Brexit negotiations or Jeremy Corbyn as Prime Minister leading a coalition propped up by the Scottish Nationalists.\" \nMr Stride also urged caution about not underestimating the challenge from the Labour Party: \"In Central Devon Labour beat the Lib Dems at the last General Election in 2015 and there cannot be any complacency. I am working flat out for every single vote and the only way residents can be sure of seeing Theresa May and not Jeremy Corbyn in Number 10 after June 8th is to vote Conservative.\" \nChairman of the Central Devon Conservative Association Mike Davies added: \"Re-selecting Mel to be our candidate was a unanimous decision on the part of the local association. He has been a superb MP for the past seven years, covering one of the most geographically challenging constituencies in the country and making a real difference to the lives of those he represents, whether campaigning for improved rail services, fighting for fairer funding for Devon schools or standing up for our farmers and much else.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-05-24T18:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-05-24T13:25:35.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
