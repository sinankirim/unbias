It would be a disaster for any government’s plan to rebalance the UK economy if a shortage of skilled labour was allowed to hold things back. This is a vital issue that the new metro mayors should tackle urgently after the elections on 4 May. \n“We have highlighted the skills shortage issue in our soon-to-be-published General Election manifesto which calls for commitments from all parties. \n“This is a major Brexit issue too. Our research estimates EU nationals account for 8% of the industry workforce which is almost 200,000 workers. \n“With UK construction already facing a chronic skills shortage, it could threaten some of the country’s biggest infrastructure and construction projects, as well as their respective pipelines.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-05-05T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-05-05T03:32:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
