Sales were up by 4.2% in the US while sales in Europe were up by 7.2%. \nBut the company said it was encountering “challenging condition in the Japanese market” and had seen a decline in sales in Asia and Oceania, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. \nA statement from the company said: “Nissan unit sales in China, which reports figures on a calendar year basis, rose 8.4% to 1.35m units, equivalent to market share of 5.0%. In Europe, excluding Russia, Nissan’s sales rose by 7.2% to 683,000 units, which resulted in a market share of 3.8%. The Qashqai SUV and Navara pickup helped drive demand in the region. \n“Nissan’s performance in these key markets helped offset challenging conditions in the Japanese market, reflecting the suspension of Kei car sales in the first half. Sales in Japan – where Kei car sales have resumed – reached 557,000 units for the 12-month period, representing a market share of 11.0%. \n“In other markets including Asia and Oceania, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, Nissan’s sales decreased 3.3% to 808,000 units.” Read More Government accused of 'bowing to Nissan's demands' to keep carmaker in the North East after Brexit \nNissan cheered the North East with a decision last year to build two new models at Sunderland, likely creating more than 1,000 new jobs. The firm also opened a £37m new press in February in what was viewed as a long-term commitment to the Wearside plant. \nBut company officials, including global chairman Carlos Ghosn and Sunderland-based senior vice president Colin Lawther, have warned that the future of the plant could be affected if the Government is unable to reach a Brexit deal with the EU that allows it to continue exporting its vehicles into Europe tariff-free.
