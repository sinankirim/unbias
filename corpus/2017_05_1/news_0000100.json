I look forward to serving our country in Parliament, particularly in health and social care.\" \nDr Khong has previously served on the governing body of NHS Leicester City Clinical Commissioning Group, with lead roles in Safeguarding Adults, Safeguarding Children, Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS), Family, Young People & Children (FYPC) and the Serious Incidents Review Panel. \nUKIP leader Paul Nuttall said. \"I'm delighted to welcome Dr Khong to the party. He has a wealth of experience both in healthcare and in politics and will be a great asset. \n\"That Teck has chosen to support UKIP at this time shows clearly that the scales are beginning to fall from the eyes of Tories about the vacuum where a serious Brexit policy lies in Theresa May's Conservative Party.\" \nA Tory party source told the Mercury: \"Teck is desperate to become an MP and doesn't seem to mind which party he will represent. \n\"I rather think joining UKIP now moves him away from that ambition not closer to it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-05-10T02:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-05-09T23:43:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
