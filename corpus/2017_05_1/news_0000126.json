The burglary happened at a residential property on the Killerton Estate, in the Hele area of Exeter. Thieves entered the home through an insecure window sometime between 2pm and 2.45pm on May 11, while the resident was out. The offender managed to escape having taken a handbag containing cash and cards from the kitchen table. Police are urging residents in the Hele area of Exeter to remain vigilant. \nDawlish will be singing in the rain this week \nThe Dawlish Musical Theatre Company have certainly excelled themselves with this hilarious and lively musical. Singing in the Rain tells the story of Don Lockwood who is a silent movie star. His leading lady, Lina Lamont, is head over heels in love with him but he does not feel the same. With the first talking picture The Jazz Singer being such a success, the head of the studio, R.F Simpson, decides he has to compete and makes The Duelling Cavalier into a talking film. The problem arises when Lina cannot sing and has a very annoying accent. Don's best friend Cosmo Brown comes up with the idea to overdub her voice with a novice actress called Kathy Selden. \nDevon expert on immigration as an election issue \nDuring this general election, as with the 2016 EU referendum that set off the chain of events leading to it, immigration is likely to play a key role. Research by the British Election Study into what mattered most to referendum voters demonstrated that leavers were primarily concerned about sovereignty and immigration. A recent ComRes/Sunday Mirror poll suggested that immigration was fourth in the list of issues most important to voters in the South West â€“ behind the NHS, Brexit, and the economy; the Brexit option likely incorporates many such concerns. \nNew Devon gin to be launched at food fair \nA brand new gin, created in South Devon using local ingredients will be launched at Dartington Food Fair.
