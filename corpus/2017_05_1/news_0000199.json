Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nEngland’s six new regional mayors are being urged to unite and fight for more powers from London. \nLeading think tank IPPR North said “metro-mayors”, including the mayor for Tees Valley, should work together to become “a powerful voice for England”. \nBut County Durham, Gateshead , Newcastle, North Tyneside, Northumberland, South Tyneside and Sunderland will not be included. \nInstead, voters went to the polls yesterday to elect mayors for Greater Manchester, the Liverpool City region, the West Midlands, Tees Valley, the West of England, and Cambridge and Peterborough. They will represent almost 20 million people between them, and results of the elections will be announced today. \nIt follows the collapse last year of talks between local councils and the Government about the creation of a North East mayor. Deputy Returning Officer Angus Taylor, left, with Guy Opperman, before the count begins at Hexham in 2015 \nNorthumberland MP Guy Opperman , a supporter of metro mayors, said: “The tragedy is that four local authorities south of the Tyne have failed to progress this, and I am very sorry we are not going to be included. \n“But ultimately they will be the ones to regret this. Why would we not want to work together to take control of issue such as skills which are essential to our region?” \nIPPR North says that the new mayors should work with London mayor Sadiq Khan and call for sweeping new powers over education, health and employment. \nAnd it claims that these Mayors can be vital players in “Team GB” post-Brexit , attracting investment and forging trade links. \nBrexit Secretary David Davis has already promised to meet the north’s new mayors once they are elected, to discuss how they can have a voice in Brexit talks. Brexit Secretary David Davis (Photo: PA) \nEd Cox, Director of IPPR North, said: “We’ve heard a lot about strong and stable leadership in this election, and we need this sort of leadership locally too, to drive inward-investment and deliver great public services.

Working together, they will be a powerful voice for England. \n“Using ‘soft powers’, they can act as advocates for their city-regions on the global stage, helping win investment and broker trade globally. \n“But while these soft powers are important, to really compete, Mayors need the kind of fiscal powers enjoyed by American mayors, German federal states and French régions. Even London only controls 7% of the tax it raises, compared to 50% in New York City. \n“With powerful local checks-and-balances, Mayors can reboot the devolution revolution and free the civil service to focus on Brexit.” Read More The North East's hardest working MPs are revealed - find out who they are \nPlans for a mayor to chair the North East Combined Authority were scrapped last year when the four leaders of Gateshead, Sunderland, Durham and South Tyneside councils voted not to go ahead unless they received more reassurances from the government over funding after the Brexit vote. \nNewcastle, Northumberland and North Tyneside councils supported the devolution plan.
