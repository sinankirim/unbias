Devon schools funding campaign gets boost from George Osborne X \nCopy link to paste in your message / Comments (0) \nDevon campaigners for fairer schools funding were joined by an unexpected ally when former chancellor-turned newspaper editor George Osborne rallied a backbench rebellion. \nOsborne, who oversaw billions of pounds in Tory austerity cuts before being ousted after the Brexit vote, used his second edition as editor of the London Evening Standard to highlight a potential MPs revolt. \nThere is anger at a new national formula that would mean nearly two thirds of Devon children would face having their school's funding cut. \nEducation Secretary Justine Greening brought forward proposals to shake up funding for schools last year, which aims to ensure similar schools in different parts of the country receive a similar level of funding per pupil. \nIt is supposed to apply a consistent and fair approach but has been widely criticised for its apparent inability to do so, with rural schools and those supposedly living in a wealthy area receiving further cuts. \nRecent analysis of the Government's proposals by Devon County Council shows that 62 per cent of Devon pupils will be taught in schools which will lose money under the new formula. \n\nRevealed : How much money every school in Devon will lose in proposed education funding changes \n\nUnder the proposals, smaller schools may benefit – because they would receive a bigger basic operating grant – but larger primary schools and the majority of secondary schools would see their funding cut. \nDevon's schools are already funded at £290 less per pupil than the national average and Devon County Council and heads and governors have fought a long campaign for fair funding. \nThe campaign received a boost after Osborne, who stood down as MP for Tatton to edit the London free paper. \nLeading with the headline Tories: Abandon School Funding Shake-up, the paper highlighted concerns among a string of senior Conservatives over proposed changes to the national funding formula. \nSeveral indicated there should be a rethink on the policy ahead of the publication of the Conservative manifesto, which is due in the coming days. \nIt comes after the former chancellor took the helm at the London paper on Tuesday, using his first day as editor to take aim at Theresa May over Brexit. \nLabour's shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said: ``It speaks volumes that even Theresa's own backbenchers realise her approach to school funding is simply an exercise in moving inadequate sums of money around. \n\"On top of this, their cuts to per-pupil spending will mean fewer teachers, cuts to school support staff and larger class sizes; while some schools are not even able to afford basic school repairs. \n\"Labour supports the principle of moving towards a fairer funding formula for schools and will ensure that all schools have the funding they need.\" \nBen Bradshaw dismissed the Tory rebels as hypocrites who had failed to act. \n\"It is complete hypocrisy for these Conservative MPs now to pretend they are against cuts to our school budgets when they have repeatedly voted for the policies, including the budgets, that have led to them,\" he added. \n\"They have had numerous opportunities to stop these damaging cuts in Parliament and have failed to do so. It's vital we keep at least one opposition MP in our region who can hold these two faced Tories to account.\" \nThe picture in Devon is further complicated by a proposed cut by the county council, on top of the national funding cut. \nTo fill a gap in funding required for children with special needs and disabilities, the Tory authority is taking £33 per student from the budget of every school. \nCouncillor Alan Connett, the county council's Liberal Democrat leader, said: \"For some schools the actual cut may be less because there is a 'Minimum Funding Guarantee' which will kick in. These are the Devon County Council's own 'worst case' figures. \n\"The Conservatives are saying that the £2.2 million isn't really a cut as the money is being recycled back into schools to support education for children with special needs. \n\"What they don't tell you is that the money doesn't go back to the schools it comes from. For example, your local school has 100 children and has a cut of £3,300 from its general teaching budget and then the money is reallocated across different schools.\" \n\"We are as keen as everyone to ensure children with special needs are properly and fully funded to get the education they need and deserve. This should be properly funded by the government. Instead, the council is cutting £2.2m (£33 per child) from general classroom teaching budgets to plug a hole in Government funding for children with special needs, short-changing children in Devon and our schools.\" \nCouncillor James McInnes, cabinet member for children, schools and skills at the county council, is hopeful the proposals will be adapted to make the funding fairer. \nHe said: \"Devon schools are facing a perfect storm. Costs are coming from all sort of directions and there is no extra educational funding to cover it. \n\"Difficult decisions are absolutely going to have to be made. The consultation of the Fairer Funding Formula has just ended and I am hopeful we will get that changed as six out of ten students will be at schools which lose money. It is just not right and they will need to look carefully again to make sure it is fair. \n\"It is a very big issue. We are continuing to talk to our MPs to make sure they represent us in Westminster and we need to link with others across the country because the plans have got people upset all over. I cannot see the government implementing something that is so devisive.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-05-04T12:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-05-04T08:31:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
