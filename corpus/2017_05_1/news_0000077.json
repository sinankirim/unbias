Try eating insects instead. \nBanning burgers and scoffing bugs could help to tackle climate change, according to new research – and feed a booming human population. \nResearchers say that replacing half of the meat eaten worldwide with crickets and mealworms would cut farmland use by a third, substantially reducing greenhouse gas emissions. \nAnd if you're squeamish, try chatting to Plymouth University associate researcher Peter Smithers , who has run events with Westcountry chef Peter Gorton. His mango and cricket risotto, apparently, is to die for. \n\"Just use the crickets as you would a bag of prawns,\" Peter says. \"They add a wonderful crunchiness, and a nutty flavour. \n\"When we've run tasting sessions, people would come to watch out of a kind of macabre fascination. By the time we've talked to them, they are tempted to try some. \n\"Before you know it, they're trying to scrape the last spoonful out of the pot.\" \nSome British farmers are already exploring the idea of farming insects. \nAgriculture in this country has reached a peak of efficiency, and little can be done to squeeze another gram of beef or lamb from the land. Insects could change all that – and already are in countries like the Netherlands, Spain and the United States. \n\"Twenty years ago the average Englishman was horrified at the idea of sushi ,\" Peter says. \"Now sushi bars are everywhere. The same will happen with insects eventually.\" \nHe buys his personal cricket supplies from Livefoods Direct, which supplies the pet trade. \nTo guarantee they are fit for human consumption, he feeds them on fresh carrot for a couple of days, puts them in the freezer to kill them (and any bugs they might carry), blanches them and then pops them in the pot. \nHowever much you like a good rump steak, it's not good for the planet, and certainly won't feed Earth's exploding population. \nCattle in particular are notorious producers of the greenhouse gases methane and carbon dioxide. \nIt takes, Peter says, 170kg of carbon dioxide to produce a single kilo of beef . Crickets, by contrast, run at 20kg per kilo of protein. \nGlobally, pasture covers twice the area of cropland, and livestock eat around a third of all harvested crops, according to a study by researchers at Edinburgh University and Scotland's Rural College. \nBritish diners are traditionally very picky about their food, but it's all in the mind. \nAs a boy growing up in Africa, I have eaten caterpillars and flying ants. The ants (termites, in fact) were particularly tasty when fried in a little butter – though it's best to catch them on the ground when their wings have fallen off. VIDEO: Herald reporter eats bugs cooked up by top Plymouth chef \nPeter says he is aware of only one restaurant in the UK which routinely serves up insects – Grub Kitchen in Pembrokeshire. \nAt present UK law lags a little. Food hygiene regulations make no mention of insects, so chefs have to tread carefully. Brexit gives us a perfect excuse to revisit the law. \nFour legs bad, six legs good, as George Orwell should have said. \nIn the first study of its kind, considered a scenario in which half of the current mix of animal products is replaced by insects, lab-grown meat or imitation meat. \nThey found that insects and imitation meat - such as soybean-based foods including tofu - are the most sustainable as they require the least land and energy to produce. \nBeef is by far the least sustainable, according to the research. \nIn contrast to previous studies, lab-grown meat was found to be no more sustainable than chicken or eggs, requiring an equivalent area of land but using more energy in production. \nThe researchers said that halving global consumption of animal products by eating more insects or imitation meat would free up 1,680 million hectares of land - 70 times the size of the UK. \nSimilar land savings could also be made by switching from the current mix of animal products to diets higher in chicken and eggs, according to the research team. \nThey found that the land required to produce these was only marginally greater than that for insects and imitation meat. \nAs well as being a major contributor to human-induced greenhouse gas emissions, current livestock production has other environmental impacts. \nThe research, published in the journal Global Food Security, was conducted in collaboration with Scotland's Rural College, York University, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany and the Centre for Australian Weather and Climate Research. \nStudy lead author Doctor Peter Alexander, of Edinburgh University, said: \"A mix of small changes in consumer behaviour, such as replacing beef with chicken, reducing food waste and potentially introducing insects more commonly into diets, would help achieve land savings and a more sustainable food system.\" \nProfessor Dominic Moran, of York University and Scotland's Rural College, added: \"The environmental challenges facing the global agricultural industry are increasing and this paper has studied some of the alternative foods that we can introduce into our diets to alleviate some of this pressure.\" \nPlymouth-based entomologist Peter Smithers believes a growing global population will result in more people turning to insects as a food source. \nHe is working with a Michelin-starred chef to create a trial menu. \nREAD NEXT", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-05-07T14:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-05-07T11:25:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
