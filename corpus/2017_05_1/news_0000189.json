X \nCopy link to paste in your message / Comments (2) \nJoe Levy has been nominated as Exeter Green Party's candidate in the 2017 General Election after an offer to the Exeter Labour Party to stand back in the general election to help them beat the Tories was turned down. \nGreen Party members in Exeter voted overwhelmingly to support a deal which would see the local Party stand down in the general election in return for Labour standing back in one of their target constituencies, the Isle of Wight. \nThe letter, hand delivered to Labour's Headquarters, applauds efforts in recent weeks to forge electoral alliances in a number of constituencies and 'makes a serious offer to save Exeter from a Tory victory locally' Read more A letter from Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw: A vote for me will not affect who governs nationally \nHowever, it makes clear the offer is wholly dependent on confirmation that Labour will stand down in the Isle of Wight. \nThe offer though was been turned down and Labour are fielding a candidate in the Isle of Wight, \nHERE IS THE FULL LIST OF CANDIDATES STANDING IN DEVON \nThe six candidates who are vying for the seat are James Taghdissian (Conservative), Vanessa Newcombe (Liberal Democrats), Joe Levy (Green), two independents in Jonathan West and Jonathan Bishop, and previous MP Ben Bradshaw (Labour). \nUKIP are not fielding a candidate, and Alison Sheridan, chairman of Exeter UKIP, said that the decision was to clear the way for the Conservatives to take on Ben Bradshaw and unseat him due to his anti-Brexit views. \nMr Levy, 22, is a resident of St Thomas, works for Exeter University at the Student Information Desk and is currently Exeter Green Party's Fundraising Officer and Young Greens Co-Ordinator. \nHe has been particularly involved with projects tackling food poverty in the city, protecting green spaces, as well as championing youth representation in local community groups. Read more Exeter Tory candidate calls Ben Bradshaw's 'independent' election stance 'bizarre' - The long read \nMr Levy said: “I am delighted to be selected to stand for Exeter Green Party. This election isn't about the next five years. It's about the next fifty years. Only the Green Party is offering real opposition to the Conservatives' extreme Brexit. Only the Green Party has the vision to deliver an alternative future for our country, and our place in the world. And only the Green Party offers a different kind of politics.\" \nThe announcement comes a day after Exeter Green Party handed a letter Labour about standing its Exeter Green Party Candidate down in this general election in a reciprocal deal. The proposal aimed at improving the chances of defeating the Tories both here in Exeter and on the Isle of Isle of Wight, where the Green Party's Vix Lowthion is best placed to beat the Tories. However Labour, have not taken up the offer. \nMr Levy added: “The Government is hellbent on some of the most extreme policies in a generation: a crumbling NHS, a jilted generation of young people being let down and pushed into debt and the pursuit of a hardline Brexit. The Green party have tried to develop electoral alliances because the political system is broken. The time has come for the Green Party to stand up for a better future for our country.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-05-12T04:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-05-12T00:18:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
