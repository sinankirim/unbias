As an expat, I’m excluded from some fascinating local authority elections with the Tories denied overall control of Northumberland through the drawing of straws. \nThe two-horse contest for the North Tyneside Mayor reflects that both victorious Labour incumbent and their Tory predecessor have governed the borough rather well. \nIf the General Election was being fought next month between Linda Arkley and Norma Redfearn, then the UK might be in a somewhat better place now than being Europe’s village idiot. \nAnd it’s been gratifying to see UKIP’s increasingly repugnant politics rejected outright as they’ve moved seamlessly from jingoism to open racism. \nSo deprived of a vote, I’ve been following the final days of a season of mixed fortunes for the region’s football clubs. I’m off to the Northern League cup final this afternoon with the prospect of a sell-out 4,000 crowd for the North vs South Shields fixture. \nIn Europe, Manchester United’s gusty first leg Portugal performance has raised the enticing prospect of a final against Amsterdam’s Ajax, a match representing the sorcerer versus the apprentice, the home of football against the latecomers. \nFootball came to Holland via the North West of England. Bernard van Heek was a scion of a textiles family in the east of the Netherlands, and his father sent him to learn the family trade to the then-global centre of textiles manufacturing, Burnley. \nDuring his year abroad, he joined the local Burnley Manufacturers’ FC, and immediately fell in love with the game. The monarchist took a football with him when he returned home in 1885 and set up a local club, Princes Wilhelmina.

Ajax was set up in 1900 and quickly established itself as a leading Dutch club, recognising its historical debt to PW as the founders of Dutch football, playing a friendly against them in 1926. \nThe Europa League final is therefore a perfect allegory for global knowledge economy. Ajax stand on the brink of the Europa League final with a team that’s paid roughly one-tenth of the Man U wage bill. \nIf you have the best ideas, then you attract the brightest minds who come and study under you. They then return home to perfect your ideas and outcompete you whilst you remain trapped in your old way of doing things. \nTo stay ahead, you should invest heavily in new knowledge and the best people. And some of the biggest economic shifts have historically when places lose talent faster they can attract them. \nIf the UK is struggling to stay ahead in the Europa League, we are imploding when it comes to the bigger European picture. After a decade of falling real wages, we are contemplating expelling the brightest minds from our country and sending them to our direct competitors. \nBrexit raises the possibility of a new European Renaissance, our neighbours booming by receiving expelled experts working in our science, health, research and technology sectors. For us, there’s no upside, just the prospect of living in the sacked ruins of a modern-day Byzantium lorded over by a reheated hash of has-been Thatcherites. \nSo if I’ve had no voice and vote in the local elections, I am making the General Elections my business to cast a vote to send a message. You can’t vote for a party basking in past glories without expecting the world will soon come and wallop you out of your complacency. \nTyneside-born Dr Paul Benneworth is a Senior Researcher at the Center for Higher Education Policy Studies at the University of Twente in the Netherlands.
