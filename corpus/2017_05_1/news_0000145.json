However, other Labour figures have also focused on the election of local MPs, rather than the question of who should be Prime Minister. \nTom Watson, the party’s Deputy Leader, said in a speech to USDAW workers: “Sometimes the most important question isn’t what makes the best PM. It’s who makes the best MP.” Read More \nAnother marginal seat is also set to see a replay of the 2015 general election. \nBerwick-upon-Tweed in Northumberland will once again see Conservative Anne-Marie Trevelyan facing Liberal Democrat candidate Julie Porksen. \nThe pair stood in 2015, when Mrs Trevelyan was elected with a majority of 4,914. \nLiberal Democrats, and their forerunners the Liberal Party, had held the seat since 1973. But they may have suffered in 2015 because long-standing MP Alan Beith (now Lord Beith) stood down after 42 years representing the constituency, and because of a nationwide drop in Lib Dem support following five years as members of the Conservative-led coalition government. \nIt means they may have a chance of taking the seat back this time. \nMrs Trevelyan, a staunch supporter of Brexit who has disagreed with the Government on some issues, said: “I hope local people have seen I am a passionate voice for them in Westminster and I’m not afraid to speak my mind and roll my sleeves up to get things done.” Read More How can I join a political party or even do a 'Citizen Smith' and form my own? \nLib Dems are calling for a second EU referendum. Mrs Porksen said: “I am delighted to confirm that I shall be standing again for the Liberal Democrats in the Berwick-upon-Tweed constituency. Our local businesses, farmers, communities, environment, health services and young people thrive through the exports, support and opportunities that Europe offers the North East. Yet the Conservatives are risking all our futures with a hard Brexit.” \nThe election was also about issues such as education and the NHS, she said.
