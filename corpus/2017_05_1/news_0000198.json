Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA County Durham factory that makes plastic injection mouldings for cars has seen its turnover edge towards the £15m mark after a strong year. \nLabone Castleside, which makes parts for Nissan and Jaguar Land Rover, said the slight increase in turnover was in line with expectations. \nThe firm saw its turnover creep up by £92,000 to £14.94m for the year ending December 31 2016. \nBut despite the minor increase in sales, operating profit rose by 33%, from £888,000 to £1.18m. Profit after tax also grew by 36% to £916,000. \nIn the company accounts, chairman Alfred Stiegler said: “We saw continued strong demand across the full range of vehicle platforms and this has resulted in a financial performance for the year which met our expectations. \n“Turnover was, as expected, broadly in line with 2015, but continued focus on systems and process improvements together with appropriate investments in new technology have contributed to an improved gross margin and pre-tax profits.” \nMr Stiegler also revealed that, after it received contracts for new work, the business was opening an additional unit at its Consett base. The new unit began production during the second quarter of 2017. \nDuring 2016 the firm created 11 new jobs, with seven of those being in manufacturing. The firm also added an extra person to its admin team as well as creating a new three-strong sales team. \nThe increased headcount led to Labone Castleside’s total staffing costs increasing from £3.8m to £4.2m. The company’s highest paid director received £94,000 last year, down from £110,000 in 2015.

Labone said that to combat the difficult market it was continuing to invest in its business. \nMr Stiegler added: “The automotive market in which we primarily operate is highly competitive and margins remain tight, with continual pressure to reduce prices. There are, however, regular new opportunities, particularly in the premium vehicle sector, as new models are launched. \n“Although the economic uncertainty surrounding Brexit makes it difficult to predict with any confidence the performance of the company in the medium term, we are continuing to invest to meet the requirements of an expanding customer base.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-05-31T01:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-05-30T20:58:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
