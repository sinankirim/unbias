Their record over the last seven years shows that. \n“What we’ve given today is a real alternative. This isn’t just an election about Brexit, it’s an election about who governs the country for the next five years, who for and who by.” \nOrganised by grassroots campaign group Momentum, the open rally was also attended by Kim McMurray - a key figure in the campaign of former US presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders.

It’s about creating a world that works for working people, and a government that works for us.
