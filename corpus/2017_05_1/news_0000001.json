I think it will be a tough campaign and I will fight for every single vote here. \n\"I am determined to do that and I am very proud of my record of standing up for people in this area.\" \nMs Kendall ran as a Labour leadership candidate in 2015, when she secured 4.5 per cent of party support and was roundly defeated by Jeremy Corbyn. \nThe Mercury twice asked her if wanted to see Mr Corbyn as the next Prime Minister but she did not answer the yes/no question. \nShe said: \"I want him to be successful in this election. I want to see as many Labour MPs returned as possible. \n\"People know I have had my differences with him but that is in the past and we are united now in trying to get a Labour Government.\" \nShe will face a Tory challenge from Jack Hickey. \nMs Kendall said she did not know anything about the 24-year-old teacher but was looking forward to meeting him. \nMr Hickey said: \"A vote for Labour's Leicester West candidate risks putting Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street, propped up with others including the SNP. \n\"I would work closely with Theresa May to get the best Brexit deal for Leicester and champion our communities around the clock in Westminster.\" \nThe Lib Dems have also picked their candidate for Leicester West â€“ blind disability campaigner Ian Bradwell, who came fifth when he contested the seat in 2015.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-05-04T00:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-05-03T20:15:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
