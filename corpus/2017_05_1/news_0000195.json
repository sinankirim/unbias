But the mutant virus infects livestock too and scientists believe it now affects 10% of sausages. The bug is killed only by longer cooking times. \nDr Harry Dalton, a gastroenterologist at Exeter University, told a conference on neurological infectious diseases last week that HEV had become a major threat. \nHe said: \"I call it the Brexit virus. It attacks the liver and nerves, with a peak in May. It is particularly dangerous for people with suppressed immune systems such as those who have had organ transplants and possibly cancer. The virus seems to come from Europe,\" Dalton said. \nThe Food Standards Agency said the virus had spread to most British pig herds with 93% of animals infected and 6% producing enough of the virus to infect humans. \nDalton said nobody should eat \"pink\" pork and advised pregnant women and transplant patients not to eat pork at all. \nThe virus is found naturally in a wide range of animals but pigs are responsible for most human cases. \nMost transmission comes through consuming raw or undercooked meat, particularly sausages, salamis, cured meats and liver-based products. \nHepatitis E is also more dangerous for anyone with existing health problems, particularly liver disease, which is also on the rise because of heavy drinking, obesity, diabetes and other members of the hepatitis family.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-05-22T16:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-05-22T12:04:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
