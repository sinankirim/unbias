By RoseCarr | Posted: May 17, 2017 0 COMMENTS SHARES Comments (0) \nCan The BIG Sheep predict the outcome of the next general election? The North Devon activity park thinks so, and with good reason. \nIn the run up to the 2017 elections, The BIG Sheep are inviting visitors to the family attraction to vote for the party of their choice in their fun and satirical pre-election. \nThese fun pre-elections have been run at the BIG Sheep during the last three elections and their predictions have always been spot on. Their E-EWE referendum predicted the 58% 42% outcome in favour of Brexit. \nRick Turner, director of the flock at The BIG Sheep says, 'We like to take a satirical and fun approach to the elections as the lead up to any election can be quite serious and boring. By looking at the lighter side of the election and characterizing the candidates by using our amazing in-house artistic talent we make all our visitors smile.' \nThe BIG Sheep exit polls will be announced the day before the election on Thursday 8th June and they are confident they will be able to predict the winning party.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-05-17T21:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-05-17T16:12:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
