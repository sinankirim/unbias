SHARES Bradshaw called the national results 'unprecedented' for a part in opposition Ben Bradshaw rues 'dreadful' night for Labour and fears Tory landslide in June X \nCopy link to paste in your message / Comments (1) \nBen Bradshaw described Labour's losses in the county council elections as a \"dreadful\" night for the party despite defending its seven seats in Devon. \nThe candidate for Exeter – a seat he has held since 1997 – said the loss of hundreds of seats across the UK represented a \"really worrying set of results\". \n\"In Exeter we seem to hanging on all right\", he told Devon live as results were coming in at a count in the city's Guildhall. \n\"We won a city council by election with an increased majority although that result is a little deceptive because there was a swing from us to the Conservatives. \n\"We know they the Conservatives are throwing everything they have at Exeter – I am the only non-Tory MP this side of Bristol and they dearly want to snatch this back.\" \nMr Bradshaw, a vocal critic of Jeremy Corbyn who stood in the deputy leadership election in 2015, voiced his fears of losing the Exeter seat as Labour endured a bruising set of results. \nIn Devon, Labour kept its seven seats, all in Exeter wards, while the Liberal Democrats maintained their tally of seven. \nThe Conservatives extended their majority to 42 seats, leaving three independents and one Green. \nThe Tories saw their share of the vote rise 7 per cent since 2013, from 35 to 44 per cent; the Lib Dem share rose from 16 to 21 per cent while Labour's climbed from 13 to 14 per cent. \nThe big losers were UKIP who were wiped out across the county, losing four seats and dropping from 23 per cent to 4 per cent of the vote. \nMr Bradshaw, a former Culture Secretary under Gordon Brown, says he is under no illusions as to the size and importance of the task for non-Conservatives. \n\"We are going to have to work extremely hard over the next few weeks defending my local record to at least keep one opposition MP in the region,\" he added. \n\"These losses for a party of opposition just a few weeks before a general election are completely unprecedented. \n\"They are really, really dreadful. We are looking at a Conservative landslide in the general election. \n\"All we can do is to try to minimise that to try to keep as many good Labour MPs up and down the country as we possibly can. \n\"My worry is that a landslide will lead to a much more right wing government – our NHS, our schools, our other public services will be at risk and we will have no checks or balances as the Tories take us out of the European Union in hardest and most damaging of Brexits – outside the Customs Union, outside the Single Market – absolutely devastating for jobs and investment in places like Exeter. \n\"It is vital we keep some MPs at Westminster, not just to fight for our region but for the city of Exeter.\" \nDevon County Council leader John Hart said he had exepcted to win his third consecutive election victory but not by such a margin. \n\"I am very humbled that the people of Devon have placed their trust in us and given us a sweeping mandate to continue our work,\" he added. \n\"We've had to make some tough decisions over the past eight years and I believe we will have more tough decisions to make in the future. \n\"But I am confident we have made Devon County Council a more efficient, effective and business-like organisation and we can now move from austerity to opportunity. \nMr Hart, who came under fire during the campaign after closing care homes, selling off libraries and running up a deficit in social care, said he had \"won all the arguments\" and would now take the council from \"austerity to opportunity\". \n\"We need to establish the right climate so that more good, better-paying jobs can be created for our residents,\" he added. \n\"We need to ensure that our young people, especially, have better skills. \n\"We must work more closely together with our partners – particularly in health – to provide better social care for our elderly and vulnerable. \n\"And we will continue to tell the Government when they've got it wrong and when we believe that Devon is not getting its fair share of the national cake in key areas like schools and infrastructure.\" \nDevon County Council list of elected members: \nTory \nCouncillor Kevin Ball
