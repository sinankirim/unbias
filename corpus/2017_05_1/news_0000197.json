It is certainly not that. \n\"Security and immigration are key parts of our plans but they have been developed over a long period.\" \nMr Helmer, an East Midlands MEP, said Brexit was the fundamental issue in the manifesto. \nHe said: \"Without UKIP there would have been no referendum, we would not have won the referendum and we would not be negotiating Brexit. \n\"Theresa May is already weakening on various fronts. \n\"There is a feeling she is going to pay up on the divorce bill, to name but one.\" \nMr Helmer, who says he is the only real Brexit supporter in south Leicestershire, \nUKIP's manifesto said there would be no divorce bill, HS2 would be scrapped and June 23 will be declared an Independence Day public holiday. \nA UKIP Government would reduce net immigration to zero over a five-year period and enforce the living and minimum wage. \nIt would build 100,000 affordable homes a year, made available to British citizens, and increase NHS spending by £9 billion a year and social care spending by £2 billion. \nThe party says it will fund its manifesto promises with Britain's EU contributions and cutting foreign aid spending which Mr Helmer said came to some £18 billion annually. \nAs UKIP energy spokesman Mr Helmer said he wanted to deliver secure energy with less reliance on renewables which he described as 'unreliables.' \nOther policies in the UKIP manifesto include screening for girls at risk of female genital mutilation and banning the wearing of the burqa and niqab in public spaces, returning to blue passports and ending sex education in primary schools \nBosworth Conservative candidate David Tredinnick said UKIP was \"a party past its sell-by date\" and that Theresa May would deliver the best Brexit deal.
