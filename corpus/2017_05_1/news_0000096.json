By danjmartin | Posted: May 04, 2017 0 COMMENTS SHARES Sir Edward Garnier will not fight the General Election Who are the Tory candidates hoping to succeed Edward Garnier as Harborough MP? X \nCopy link to paste in your message / \nThe seat has a Tory majority of more than 19,000 and is widely considered a safe path into parliament for whoever is chosen to fight it on June 8. \nThe Harborough Conservative Association is set to select a candidate tomorrow night but the website Conservative Home has reported on a shortlist of candidates. General Election 2017: Click HERE for everything you need to know \nThe first hopeful, according to Conservative Home, is Tim Clark who is currently the Principal of Skinners' Academy in Hackney and was headmaster of Spalding High School in Lincolnshire. \nIn 2005 he stood unsuccessfully against David Blunkett in Sheffield Brightside, and in 2014 he was a finalist in the Boston and Skegness selection. \nRead more: Harborough Tory MP Edward Garnier confirms he won't stand in the General Election \nThe next is Helen Harrison, a district councillor in East Northamptonshire, who runs her own physiotherapy business, having previously spent much of her career in the NHS. \nShe fought the Ashfield seat in the 2015 General Election and is director of the pro-Brexit campaign group Grassroots Out. \nNeil O'Brien is the third candidate. \nHe is the former director of Policy Exchange and Open Europe. \nHe advises on industrial strategy and the Northern Powerhouse in the Prime Minister's Policy Unit and was a special adviser to George Osborne in the Treasury from 2012 to 2016. \nThe Mercury understands CCHQ ordered a closed list of candidates immediately barring local hopefuls like former police and crime commissioner candidate Neil Bannister, Harborough-based East Midlands MEP Emma McClarkin and Harborough District Council leader Blake Pain. \nIt is understood the decision to exclude candidates with stronger links to the constituency has caused resentment among some local activists. \nOadby and Wigston borough councillor Teck Khong had indicated he would have liked to fight the seat having previously been removed from a Tory candidates list. \nHowever he did not make the shortlist and has apparently quit the party and is now listed as an independent councillor. \nHe has not responded to a Mercury request for a comment. \nThe Conservative Party has declined to comment on selection matters ahead of the meeting. \nThe Liberal Democrats have selected Zuffar Haq to fight the seat and Labour have chosen Andy Thomas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-05-04T19:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-05-04T15:27:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
