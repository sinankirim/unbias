There would be less money to spend in hospitals, not more.” Read More Are our hospital's parking meters up to scratch? Here's how they fared in a new report \nA Liberal Democrat spokesperson said: “Labour have failed as an opposition and voted with the Conservatives for a Hard Brexit that will mean less money for the NHS. \n“Only the Liberal Democrats are being honest with the public about the need to all chip in a little more to rescue the NHS and care.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-05-08T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-05-08T18:13:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
