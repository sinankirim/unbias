The political parties are more determined than ever before to stage-manage their campaigns and avoid speaking to the public. \n“We want to make sure that the voice of the business community is not ignored. All of the candidates standing for election in our region should be able to say how their policies will affect the companies that are so important to our economy. \n“Our manifesto will enable us to hold the political parties to account both in the run-up to the election and afterwards, as the next Government plots the country’s path towards Brexit and beyond.” Labour party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, waits foir a householder to answer the door as he canvasses for votes on the streets of Warrington on April 22, 2017 in Warrington, United Kingdom (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \nThe manifesto survey is based around 12 key issues for North East businesses, with participants asked to rate them as high, medium or low priorities. \nAmong the issues raised are improvements to transport and IT infrastructure, devolution for the North East, access to European markets and labour after Brexit, and reforming business rates. \nWith none of the political parties having yet published their manifestos, it is unclear what their exact policies on business will be. \nPrime Minister Theresa May has spoken of plans to protect workers’ pensions from irresponsible bosses, while Labour has floated a number of policies designed to tackle the problems businesses are caused by late payment. The Lib Dems have made Brexit and securing access to trade in Europe a key part of their election campaign. \nThe survey can be found at www.chroniclelive.co.uk/manifesto .
