Each sale sees an average of 500 buyers registering and ready to purchase. Topping the year was the 'Hitachi Excavator' that reached £68,000, which went to its new home near Bristol; after somewhat of a bidding war between no less than nine hopeful buyers. \nOne of the smartest line-ups of plant machinery took place during the summer on behalf of Roy Baker of St Clether, who saw his well-maintained equipment top at £19,000 for his digger. This was followed by the best of his Takeuchi TB235 at £16,900, going to the Midlands. \nMachinery auctioneer James Morrish said: \"The South West has a vast amount of plant machinery and we are delighted to see so many vendors and purchasers choosing to trade at Holsworthy, and long may it continue.\" \nA total of 84 tractors and telehandlers have been sold at Holsworthy over the last 18 months. Top call from these sales was £20,000 for the best of the Massey Fergusson tractors from Messrs Grigg of Week St Mary. The best of the New Holland tractors made £19,500 on behalf of Wayne Radford, who also saw his best 2WD tractor reach £13,000 and head to Dulverton. \nREAD MORE: Leading firm appointed to guide Devon organic dairy through Brexit \nDirector David Kivell added: \"The Saturday machinery sales have become an integral part of our business, along with bringing thousands of people to the Holsworthy area. We are delighted as a company to direct people who travel down the day before the sale to various bed and breakfasts and hotels in the local area. This alone is much needed business for our local community.\" \nKivells' on-farm dispersal sales have seen 10,497 lots sold since January last year, with buyers in attendance and online from locations such as southern Ireland, Edinburgh and Norfolk. \nThe highlight of the year was a fantastic farm sale for Messrs White who farms just outside of Wadebridge in North Cornwall. The sale included one of the best line-up's of farm machinery Kivells has ever sold in its 132 years of business. Top call on this day was £46,500 given for an outstanding Fendt tractor, purchased by one farmer in Mid Cornwall. \nThe Kivells heritage and vintage sales are always well respected and attended. Over the last year or so we have had many very special lots come to the market to be sold. Among the highlights has to be the collection of 14 tractors from one deceased estate in South East Cornwall. The sale saw models rarely seen at auctions including Oliver, Nuffield and two very special Ford Ferguson tractors. \nA new addition to the Kivells machinery calendar is the commencement of machinery sales at Exeter Livestock Market. These are set to get under way on Wednesday, June 14. \nTo find out more details on all upcoming sales visit the website www.kivells.com READ NEXT:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-05-03T17:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-05-04T02:55:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
