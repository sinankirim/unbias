wealthiest people revealed in Sunday Times Rich List By Lauren_Mills | Posted: May 05, 2017 5 COMMENTS SHARES Leicestershire's wealthiest people revealed in Sunday Times Rich List X \nCopy link to paste in your message / Comments (5) \nThe owner of Triumph Motorcycles has become Leicestershire's richest businessman, after his wealth soared over the past year. \nJohn Bloor, a former plasterer from Measham, saw his wealth rise by £204 million to £1.45 billion, making him the biggest winner in the East Midlands, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. \nMr Bloor, who lives in Swadlincote, bought the Hinckley-based Triumph name for £150,000 in 1983 and invested £80 million in a new factory to revive the marque. \nMr Bloor owns Bloor Holdings, the parent company of both Triumph and the Bloor Homes house-building business, which saw profits rise to £124.5 million in 2016, up from £96 million in the previous year. \nSunday Times Rich List editor Robert Watts said: \"A boost to the construction industry because of the Government's Help to Buy scheme, as well as a 4.5 per cent sales increase at Triumph, saw the value of the combined operation rise to £1.4 billion in 2017, allowing for a hefty brand value on the Triumph name.\" \nMr Bloor beat Will Adderley and family to second place in the East Midlands Rich List, after tying with them last year. \nRead more: Developer responds to latest housing plans \nWill Adderley, left \nIn contrast to Mr Bloor, Mr Adderley and family, who run Syston-based Dunelm home furnishing retailer, saw their wealth decline by £67 million to £1.182 billion. \nThe company began life as a market stall in Leicester Market run by Mr Adderley's parents, Bill and Jean, in 1979. \nBut Dunelm has had a dismal year. Sales – not including newly-opened shops – fell 4.3 per cent for the 13 weeks to April 1. \nIts shares have fallen from 897p a year ago to 615p, valuing the company at £1.2 billion. \nDespite this they are still the second wealthiest people in the county. \nThen comes David Ross. \nA Brexit supporter and co-founder of Carphone Warehouse, Mr Ross's Carphone Warehouse merged with Dixons to form Dixons Carphone in 2014. \nHis combined stakes in the two companies are now worth £373 million, down £140 million over the year. \nBut dividends, a £105 million property portfolio and other investments make him worth £803 million – third in the county and sixth in the region. \nOutside of work, Mr Ross is a shooting enthusiast who once spent £22 million on two grouse moors in North Yorkshire. He also plans to build a new opera house in the stables at his 14th-century Leicestershire mansion at Neville Holt. \nFreddie Linnett and the Murphy family, owner of Thurmaston property firm Charles Street Buildings are in seventh place in the region and fourth in the county. \nTheir wealth has increased by £45 million to £640 million. \nSir David Samworth and family came in at eighth in the region and fifth in the county. \nBest known for its Walkers pork pies and Ginsters pasties, Samworth Brothers makes half of the pork pies sold in the UK. \nSir David, 81, is president of the business and the family fortune has risen by £110 million to £575 million in the past year thanks to a tasty near-£16 million rise in profits in 2015-16. \nDavid Wilson and family, owner of Ibstock house-builder Davidsons, and founder of David Wilson Homes, saw his fortune continue to climb. This time by £13 million to £540million. \nThere was no change for Michael Gregory, founder of Cromwell Tools, a Wigston industrial tools supplier, whose fortune remained static at £250 million. \nThe same was true for brothers Rashid and Aziz Tayub and family, who founded the Crown Crest cash-and-carry business, which went on to buy Poundstretcher. \nThey set up Crown Crest when they arrived in the UK from Malawi. \nTheir fortune stood still at £250 million. \nLeicester City's Thai owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, who has an estimated fortune of at least £1.15 billion is not included as he is not domiciled in the UK. \nThe Sunday Times Rich List will be published this weekend.
