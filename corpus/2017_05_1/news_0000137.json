Comments (0) \nAllowing Theresa May and the Conservatives to work towards a suitable Brexit is the reason why UKIP are not fielding a candidate in Newton Abbot for the General Election. \nIn 2015, the party secured 6,726 (14 per cent) votes in the constituency, placing them in third place, above Labour and the Green Party, but behind the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives. \nBut the party are not standing in Newton Abbot in the June 8 General Election. \nHERE IS THE FULL LIST OF CANDIDATES STANDING IN DEVON \nSteven Harvey, UKIP Newton Abbot Branch Chairman, said that they did consider fielding a candidate in the constituency this time, but said that standing against MP's who supported UKIP's position in the Brexit referendum may lead to the negotiations not going the correct way. \nUKIP are also not fielding a candidate in Exeter. \nMr Harvey, who is standing as a candidate in Totnes where the previous MP, Dr Sarah Wollaston voted to remain, said: \"The 6726 (14%) votes we achieved in 2015 helped towards the Referendum being called and we considered the fact that Anne-Marie Morris has shown such great support for the \"VOTE LEAVE\" campaign, andw e even handed out leaflets together. \n\"As long as Theresa May and the Conservatives are working towards a suitable Brexit, we need them to continue that. \n\"Standing against MP's who supported UKIP's position in the referendum may lead to the negotiations not going the correct way.\" Read more Dad's emotional plea to driver who left his son 'for dead' \nHe added: \"If the Conservatives fail to provide the Brexit we voted for - you will see UKIP fighting and campaigning like never before. \n\"But as it's only the Conservatives who can negotiate with the EU, we feel we must support them at this time.\" \nHe added: \"But UKIP has not gone away and we will be keeping a close eye on things. Our 4million supporters are now voting for what's best for the UK's negotiating position, which is not a vote for Labour, the Lib Dems or Green. \n\"That does not mean that in the future, previous UKIP supporters will vote Conservative again. If we do not get the right deal for Britain, I'm sure we will have their support again, and our fight against the EU will continue.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-05-12T20:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-05-12T18:40:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
