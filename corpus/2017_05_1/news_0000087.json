Find out instantly with our unique constituency guide. \nSimply enter your postcode and you'll get a range of crucial information – like who is standing, and who is likely to win. You'll also get a run-down of the major issues in your area using the latest official statistics. \nThe data have been divided into six main issue groups: the economy, the cost of living, immigration, pensions, health and the EU referendum. The tool draws on a selection of relevant measures to estimate how much – or little – each issue might affect the election. \nThe figures have all been taken from a range of official sources including the Office for National Statistics, the Department for Work and Pensions, NHS England and the Land Registry. The economy category includes the strength of the housing market, unemployment figures and business counts as well as how these figures have changed between 2012 and 2016. \nCost of living takes into account average wages, house price affordability and the number of people living in low-income families, and also looks at how these figures have changed since 2012. The immigration section comprises statistics on the number of people living in each constituency who were born outside the UK and the number of foreigners seeking National Insurance numbers. \nThe figures for the pensions category include the percentage of people in each constituency aged 65 and above as well as the amount spent on pensions per head of the population. \nHealth data is organised by NHS Clinical Commissioning Group rather than by constituency but the idea is the same. The health category takes into account how satisfied people are with their GP, satisfaction with their practices' opening hours the time taken for people being referred to hospital to be treated, and cancer waiting times. \nFinally you'll be able to see at-a-glance whether your area voted Leave or Remain in last year's referendum and how strongly your area felt we should be in or out of the EU.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-05-23T20:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-05-23T18:14:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
