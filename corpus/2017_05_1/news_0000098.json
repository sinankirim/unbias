that Tories fear-mongering and spin machine will make some people settle for less than they should and resign themselves to things the way they are.\" \nMr Corbyn said it was the Tory's mission to rig the system for the rich. \n\"We know from the (local) election results that the gap between the Tories and us is not as great as some of the pundits have been saying. \n\"But we still have many people to convince. \n\"Our Westminster system is broken and our economy is rigged. \n\"Both are run in the interests of the few. \n\"Things can and must be different. \n\"Labour are under attack because we are standing up to the elite who are determined to hijack Brexit, to pay even less tax and take even more of the wealth we all create. \n\"The only time the Conservatives stand up is when they are taking orders from their billionaire friends. \n\"We are under attack because we are standing up to corporate interests plundering the NHS. \n\"Â£13 billion of NHS budget is already privatised. \n\"How much more will be left if the Tories get another five years damaging our NHS. \n\"We are drawing a line under decades of privatisation from energy to rail to health and social care that has made some people very rich but has not delivered richer lives to the many.\" \nDespite the enthusiastic reception in Leicester, a number of party figures have said Mr Corbyn's leadership is hindering their chances of getting elected. \nTory North West Leicestershire parliamentary candidate Andrew Bridgen contacted the Mercury after becoming aware Mr Corbyn was in town. \nHe said: I wish Jeremy Corbyn would come to my area because I could do with getting my campaign off to a flying start. \n\"If Jeremy Corbyn is the answer I shudder to think what the question could be?\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-05-07T01:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-05-06T20:23:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
