With Anthony Joshua commanding more press and media coverage than the election and Brexit combined over the weekend, I suspect sport does matter – and matter a lot. \nSport has excited, entertained and engaged nations since the dawn of time. Indeed, wars were suspended while the ancient Greeks assembled for what are today called the Olympic Games. The Romans built great coliseums in which to stage their sports. Today, it remains living theatre and an integral part of our society, culture and way of life. \nIt is interesting to see the aristocrats of sport honoured and lauded by their nations. Barcelona and Madrid are internationally known not only for their commerce and industry, but for the prowess of their football teams. As a child, I grew up to applaud the traditional status of rugby's 'big two', Leicester and Bath. Others have come and gone as the window of fame highlights their success and achievement. Of late, Saracens are now champions for the success they have bought on the field, which set me thinking. \nLike Wladimir Klitschko, Sarries have won games and collected silverware to earn their place as 'champions', but like Klitschko, Saracens have not really captured the hearts of the sporting masses. Why so? Well, the giant Ukrainian certainly lumbered around the ring for a decade leaning on opponents and dispatching their hopes and dreams with his defensive armoury and massive reach. He did not stir the emotions like my sporting hero Muhammad Ali. \nNow on to my point; there is a new force to be reckoned with in English sport. Yes, I accept Anthony Joshua to be boxing's new blue-eyed boy, but neither AJ nor Saracens are the subject of my missive. I am referring, of course, to our very own Exeter Chiefs. \nRead next: Gloucester vs Exeter Chiefs - Match preview as Rob Baxter urges Exe to push for home semi-final \nIt has fascinated me all season how we appear to have gone under the radar of the pundits who continue to look over their shoulder to the past and not forward into the future. Chiefs have collected 35 league points from seven successive bonus point wins – a feat unprecedented in Premiership rugby. \nWe continue to confound the critics and experts with the energy, pace and ambition of our game. All too often I hear commentators telling us what is wrong with our game and how we should play more territory and show less ambition to run with the ball. To those pundits, I suggest you rethink your gameplan. Yes, professional rugby is a results-driven business, but rugby is also an entertainment where the fans want to see the ball in play, action and competition. \nThere is little to admire with big men strutting about, postulating and procrastinating while resetting and repeatedly collapsing scrums in pursuit of a penalty. Similarly, there is little entertainment or spectacle with the on-field committee meetings that resemble a WI meeting more than a Premiership rugby encounter while the clock runs on with nothing happening. Exeter Chiefs are a breath of fresh air on and off the field. \nWe are one of the few Premiership clubs to make a profit, nor do we haemorrhage the money of fat cat investors who seek to buy success at any cost. No, our culture is one of honesty, hard work and loyalty. \nExeter Chiefs are the real deal on which the magic of sport is built. Yes, we've a way to go and yes there is the chance that the lumbering Klitschkos of rugby's Premiership might yet frustrate, procrastinate or kick-chase us to defeat, but like the tide, our tsunami offence will keep coming and coming until we secure the position of champions. \nIt is all very much to play for and the ball is in our court. A win at Kingsholm and Sarries beating Wasps could well see Tigers here at Sandy Park for a semi-final showdown. Who would have thought that possible? My dream final would be Chiefs versus Wasps at Twickenham, but first we have a game to win and a stiff challenge from the Cherry & Whites in Gloucester to come first.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-05-04T17:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-05-04T14:14:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
