Is an outright ban on politics chat the answer? The Mercury asked Alan Price, chief executive of employment law, HR, and health & safety specialists Croner, in Hinckley: \nWhile you can't prevent political discussions at work, it is important to remind employees to be respectful. \nPolitical views are a personal matter that are often deeply held and this can lead to discussions turning confrontational and personal. \nEmployers need to ensure that employees are aware of what is, and isn't, acceptable to say in the workplace regarding politics to reduce the risk of political discrimination. \nA ban on employees talking about politics is likely to be difficult to uphold so employers need to be realistic and ensure any talk is legal and conducive to the workplace.
