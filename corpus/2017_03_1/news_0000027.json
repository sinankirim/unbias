If I were going to be a boxer, I wouldn’t have spent most of my life swigging Pepsi Max, playing chess and doing politics - and I would have known what all those strange machines at a gym are actually for. \nAnd yet, on Saturday night, I’ll be headlining a bill at London’s York Hall - the home of boxing. \nIt’s been a surreal and somewhat crazy few months: on a cold Wednesday in January, I was giving evidence to a House of Lords Select Committee. On the Thursday, I was organising a boxing match. I’ve spent many hours at the gym, learned to box and lost over two and a half stone in the process. \nMost people, on the other hand, know that I’m pretty decent at chess. My chess CV is much stronger than my boxing CV: I was in the England Under-21 squad, captained Yorkshire from 2002 to 2004, have beaten Grandmasters (rarely), I’ve represented a top British team in the European Club Cup, and so on. \nI thought a boxing match for charity might encourage me to get fitter and healthier, whilst raising money for a worthy cause. \nThen, over dinner, someone reminded me of a sport I’d heard of some time ago: chessboxing. It’s quite a niche thing: competitors play speed chess for three minutes before a bell rings; then they don gloves and box for two minutes. \nRepeat chess and boxing until the bout ends either by checkmate or knockout. \nI had a brief phone call with the London Chessboxing Association, and it turns out they loved the idea of having a politician on their next show. \nAs if the intersection of the ‘chess’ and ‘boxing’ sets wasn’t small enough, they leapt at the chance to add ‘politician’ to the mix. They found a Liberal Democrat opponent for me, and the rest is history. \nThe BBC did a brief segment on the Daily Politics about the upcoming bout. They encouraged Lib Dem leader Tim Farron to play me at speed chess whilst they interviewed me about the chessboxing. I beat him at chess in 36 seconds; he was actually really nice about it. I just hope that I last longer than 36 seconds against Toby ‘Slowby’ White in the boxing ring on Saturday night, or the April fool will be on me. \nSo why (other than my new, still-not-quite-svelte figure) am I doing this? \nYes, I want to raise awareness of the benefits of a mind sport like chess as well as the huge positive social impact that boxing has on communities. \nMore importantly on a personal level, I’m doing this to raise money for charity. In October, one of my colleagues sadly lost their baby daughter to Spinal Muscular Atrophy. \nThe charity helped the parents, as they have done many others before, through the last few months of their daughter’s life, enabling her to leave hospital and have the specialist equipment that was so desperately needed. \nIt’s always refreshing to support a charity when you know that the money is going to the right people. I’ve been so impressed with everything I’ve heard about ACT for SMA (the Ally Cadence Trust for Spinal Muscular Atrophy) that I’m only too delighted to be raising money for them. \nMy Liberal Democrat opponent has very kindly helped to raise funds for the same charity too. \nIt’s rare that I’ll agree with the Liberal Democrats on much but it’s great to be able to do something for once that transcends party politics. \nThe more money I can raise, the better. In the meantime, I have work to do. The London Chessboxing Association has dubbed the bout the ‘Brexit Belt’ and I fully intend to be taking that belt home on Saturday night. I must admit I’m worried that if I beat a Lib Dem opponent, he won’t accept the result and demand that it must be run again... \nWhen was the last time that anyone ever stepped into a boxing ring for their first ever fight of any kind, to top a bill at the York Hall? Definitely one for the bucket list. \nJonathan Arnott is Ukip MEP for the North East.
