A passer-by dialled 999 when he saw from the other end of Torre Abbey sands what he thought were two youths caught by the tide on the rocks at Corbyn Head. \nThe alarm was raised at 4.45pm and the Coastguard helicopter from Portland was brought in as well as a Torbay Coastguard team of ten and the inshore Torbay lifeboat. \nJohn Bunce, sector officer for Torbay Coastguard, said they had reports that one of the youths had gone into the water apparently fully clothed. \n\"When we arrived on the scene there were no obvious signs of the youths. The inshore lifeboat fully checked the walkway and caves under the cliff and scanned the water in the area in case there were any casualties, as did the helicopter. \n\"The coastguard put a cliff man on the edge to look over down to the area where the caller said he had seen the youths. Nobody was located, we can only assume the youths had made their way back. There were quite a few youths on the beach and it may have been connected with that.\" \nA Coastguard helicopter was also in Torquay earlier in the afternoon for crew training. \nREAD MORE: \nTorquay's iconic Riviera Wheel - back for five years? \nTorquay's much loved Riviera Wheel could be back in town for a further five years.
