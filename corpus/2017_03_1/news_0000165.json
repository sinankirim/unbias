Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA letter signed by Prime Minister Theresa May outlining the UK’s wish to leave the European Union was received today. \nGiving official notice under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, it will be delivered to European Council president Donald Tusk later. \nIn a statement in the Commons, the prime minister will then tell MPs this marks “the moment for the country to come together”. \nIt follows June’s referendum which resulted in a vote to leave the EU . \nEvents have occurred at such speed we decided to get back to basics to put together a simple Brexit guide . What does Brexit mean?

It could have been ‘Ukit’ although this was less catchy and anyway the potential for an expletive was too obvious. Why is Britain leaving the European Union? \nIt all began last June - June 23 to be precise - with the stunning referendum result when 51.9% of those who voted said they wanted to leave the EU, while 48.1% voted to remain. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting. And how did the North East vote?

In South Tyneside , the vote for Leave was 62%, followed by Sunderland (61.3%), Durham (57.5%), Gateshead (56.8%), Northumberland (54.1%) and North Tyneside (53.4%). Only Newcastle voted to ‘Remain’ with 50.7% wanting to stay in the EU. When did the UK first join the European Union and what was the referendum result then? \nThe UK joined the European Economic Community, as it was then, in 1973 but there was no vote. It took a lot of persuading to get us in by Conservative Prime Minister Edward Heath. France wasn’t keen on us at all, particularly its President Charles de Gaulle who famously said ‘non’ to the UK’s attempts to join, first in 1963 and again in 1967. De Gaulle died in 1969. So we’ve never voted to join or at least stay in the EU?

In 1975, after Heath’s Tory government was replaced by Labour under Harold Wilson. The issue split Labour (sound familiar?) however the public was united and endorsed the UK’s continued membership with a massive 67% of the vote.
