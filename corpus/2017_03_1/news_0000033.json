She said the desk has “huge emotional value to me”. \nMarianne had the George III mahogany 18th century writing bureau shipped to a home in South Devon for safe keeping always intending to reclaim it. “It was to be stored there until we moved to a bigger house out of London,” said Marianne. \n“With Brexit, it’s been taking a lot longer than expected. I was very close to my grandma growing up, I used to spend all my holidays with her in Holland, as my family moved around internationally so much. She’s 92, and in a care home with advanced stage Alzheimers, which is so heartbreaking.

I don’t have any family in the UK, so I’m quite sentimental about any family attachments to my family in Holland. I’d wanted to pass the desk to my little boys one day.” \nThe desk was sold for £15 and Marianne has established it was collected by a man who took it from the house in Paignton for free, along with a few pieces of other furniture. \nMarianne said: “He and his wife then sold it on Gumtree on or around January 19 for £15 from Paignton. I contacted Gumtree but as the buyer rang the seller, they haven’t got any details. The seller is trying to help me by placing an ad asking for the buyer to get in touch ( https://www.gumtree.com/p/desks/writing-desk..-nee... ). \n“They’ve said it was either a local middle-aged couple or man. I am absolutely devastated as are my family in Holland. I don’t know Torquay that well, and would be so grateful for any pointers you could give on how I might advertise or request help to get this desk back.” \nShe has placed a banner ad on Gumtree: https://www.gumtree.com/p/community/searching-for-...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T23:01:25.191+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
