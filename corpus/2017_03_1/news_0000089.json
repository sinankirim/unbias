It must be about the biggest employer in Seaton Delaval.” \nThe factory was first run by Shulton’s which opened it in 1962. It was then taken over by Procter & Gamble in 1990 before it sold its in a multi billion pound deal to Coty last year. Councillor Bernard Pidcock \nWe understand that local MP Ronnie Campbell and the leader of Northumberland County Council have been made aware of the situation and are waiting for a decision. \nIf the Seaton Delaval factory was to close, there would be speculation it might be as a result of the Brexit vote to leave Europe. \nCoun Pidcock said: “I don’t know about that - you could speculate about Brexit until you die of boredom.” \nHe added: “The thing is it is a major employer and an amazing place. It’s something we’re very proud to have here.” Read More Tributes paid to Morpeth mum who died during gruelling 10-mile endurance race \nA spokesperson for Coty said: “Last October we began a detailed study of our global manufacturing capacities and capabilities for each of our divisions. \n“The goal of this study is to define the best manufacturing footprint to deliver our future growth. The outcomes of the studies, which are subject to board approval, are to be announced to employees today. \n“Our priority is always to speak to employees first, and we will be sharing the full recommendations and proposals today. \n“Coty will not be commenting further until staff have been briefed on the results of the study.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T19:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T16:07:13.562+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
