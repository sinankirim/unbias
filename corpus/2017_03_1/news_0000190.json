Voluntary controls are unlikely to work in this area and the Government should introduce mandatory controls.\" \nMPs also said they agreed with Public Health England that confectionery and other less healthy foods should be removed from the ends of aisles and checkouts. \n\"We recommend an outright ban on these practices and call on retailers to end the promotion of high-calorie discounted products as impulse buys at the point of non-food sales.\" \nWhile welcoming the new tax on sugary drinks, MPs concluded they were \"extremely disappointed that several key areas for action that could have made the strategy more effective have not been included.\" \nThey also said the cost of the sugar tax must be passed on to consumers by companies in order to be effective. \nNicola Blackwood, the public health minister, said: \"We welcome the committee's recognition of the progress we have made in this area, delivering the most ambitious plan on childhood obesity in the world. \n\"It is backed by the soft drinks industry levy as well as the most comprehensive reformulation programme of its kind, anywhere. \n\"Voluntary approaches have been shown to be very effective, but as we have repeatedly said, we have not ruled out further measures if results are not seen.\" \nRead next:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T17:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T15:21:09.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
