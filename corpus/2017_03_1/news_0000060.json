By HannahFinch | Posted: March 30, 2017 0 COMMENTS SHARES Ian Glendinning, chairman of E & JW Glendinning Limited Which Devon firm is among UK's fastest growing profit makers? X \nCopy link to paste in your message / Comments (0) \nDevon and Cornwall have just one firm among the fastest growing in the UK. Family quarrying firm Glendinning made £7million profit to April 2016 and is among seven South West companies to feature in the 18th annual Sunday Times BDO Profit Track 100 published this weekend. \nThe league table ranks Britain's private companies with the fastest-growing profits over three years.Coming in at 53 - down from 33 last year - is Glendinning. \nBased in Ashburton and with 224 staff, it is Devon's largest family-owned quarrying, concrete and road contracting firm . Profits have grown by 76% over the last three years. \nThe seven companies headquartered in the southwest of England, compared to nine last year, include five new entrants to the league table. They have made a strong contribution to the local economy. Together they employ 1,900 staff and have achieved combined profits of £48m. \nThe highest ranked company in the region is Bristol-based Avon Group, which features in the top three. The company makes precision-cut gaskets, seals and mouldings in its six factories across the southwest of England, and one in Chicago. Profits grew by an average of 149% to £11m in 2016. Appearing for the second time is Wiltshire-based Animal Friends Pet Insurance. Elaine Fairfax and her husband Chris founded the company with the aim of raising money to help animals, and have since donated over £3m to more than 300 charities. Profits grew by an average of 87% a year to £8m in 2015. The companies in the southwest appear with businesses from around the UK, including domestic appliance designer Gtech, bottled drinks manufacturer Radnor Hills and gym operator PureGym. The companies have achieved a higher average rate of profit growth (83%) than any previous Profit Track 100 league table, which have typically ranged from 50%-75% pa. The minimum rate of profit growth to secure a place has also risen to 57% pa - annual growth in the mid-40s has typically been sufficient to feature on previous tables. The league table and awards programme is sponsored by BDO and UBS Wealth Management, and is compiled by Fast Track, the Oxford-based research and networking events firm. Andrea Bishop, partner and head of the southwest at BDO, the title sponsor of the league table, said: \"High-growth, mid-sized businesses played a leading role in the UK economic recovery after the global financial crisis. With Brexit and more uncertainty looming, it is companies like these with their natural energy, ambition and entrepreneurial spirit that will help the UK economy thrive. By supporting their growth, government would also be helping to achieve a more regionally balanced economy that 'works for all'.\" \nThis year's profit Track 100 companies achieved, on average, profit growth of 83% a year over three years, to a total of £1bn in 2015/16. Together they employ 47,700 staff, having added 17,300 employees to their combined workforce over the period, some as a result of acquisitions. \nLondon is the most popular location for company HQs with 25, followed by the southeast (15). Of the remainder, 13 are based in the northwest, eight in Scotland, seven in the West Midlands, seven in Yorkshire, seven in the southwest, five in Wales, four in the East Midlands, four in the East, four in Northern Ireland, and one in the northeast. \nThe full league table will be published as a six-page broadsheet supplement with the business section of The Sunday Times on April 2, both in print and in the digital edition, and on www.fasttrack.co.uk .
