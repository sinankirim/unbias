(Photo: Sunday Mercury) \nShe said: \n“I voted for the amendment. The Lords is a revising chamber and doesn’t block legislation and the reality is the government will get its legislation through. \n“What I’m therefore concerned about is very much the prosperity of our country and the prosperity of the North East. \n“Whichever way people voted it wasn’t to get a worse deal than the one we have at present.” \nMs Quin said she wasn’t taking to protest about Brexit and overturn it. \n“The vote is a fact and the government will begin the process.” \nHowever she commented that what she wanted was to maintain strong links with Europe and keep in place EU legislation like on environmental issues, which has give the UK cleaner beaches and cleaner drinking water. \nShe said: \n“The referendum result was quite close. A lot of people voted to keep many of our links.” 11:34 KEY EVENT Why are they marching? \nThe North East for Europe group which has organised it said they wished to show solidarity with fellow EU citizens living in the North East who are concerned about their right to live and work here. \nThe march follows the defeat of the government’s Brexit bill the House of Lords last week which said ministers should guarantee EU nationals’ right to stay in the UK after Brexit. \nThe vote, by 358 to 256, is the first Parliamentary defeat for the government’s Brexit bill. \nHowever, MPs will be able to remove their changes when the bill returns to the House of Commons. 11:30 KEY EVENT What is happening? \nPro-Europe supporters from all around the country are set to gather in Newcastle city centre for a march today. \nLarge crowds are expected to meet at 12pm at the Newcastle City Pool to march to the Monument in Grey Street. \nThey will then listen to speeches from a number of high profile speakers like world renowned philosopher and author Professor AC Grayling and former North East Labour MEP and Minister for Europe Joyce Quin.
