He said: \"We will not be having our two speakers with us as they are needed in Westminster.\" He described the incident as a despicable, sick attack on innocent men, women and children. \"Our thoughts are with the victims, their families and all those injured in the attack,\" he said. Members of the FSB from across the country are expected to attend the three-day event held at The Riviera International Centre in Torquay. It is an opportunity to discuss the issues facing small businesses including Brexit, climate change, apprenticeships and auto enrolment. \nThey were welcomed by Torbay Mayor Gordon Oliver. He hailed the benefits of the £110 million South Devon Highway that has cut journey times from Newton Abbot to Torquay to five minutes. \"Everyone arrives early for their meetings these days,\" he said. Mr Oliver spoke of the economy entering the fourth industrial revolution. \"From 2020, 80% of jobs will be hi-tech, \" he said. He said that work is due to begin next year on a hub for photonic technology. He said: \"We have some wonderful opportunities, let's grab them with both hands and make it work.\" But infrastructure remains an issue. The region's MPs debated poor mobile and broadband connectivity – a problem shared by FSB members in rural communities right across the country. FSB commercial director Dave Stallon said: \"Like our Government, the first day of our national business show will go on.\" He said that representing the voice of its members was vital for the organisation in uncertain times. He said: \"We must stop and listen to our grass-root members as well as the whole business community. We must adapt and evolve.\" Today's programme includes a debate on climate change and talk by media specialist Fergal Parkinson.
