Could   \nBuilders merchant James Burrell saw its profit soar by almost 25% despite spending £1.1m on its flagship Gateshead store. \nThe site on Deptford Road underwent an “extensive transformation” mainly focusing on improving the site’s collect and despatch facilities. \nThe investment came after the firm opened its eighth store in Sunderland in mid-2015. James Burrell now has stores in Gateshead, Sunderland, Newcastle, Blyth, Stockton, Bishop Auckland, Ossett and York. \nProfit for the financial year ending October 31 2016 increased to £628,000 last year, up from £504,000 in 2015. Over the same period the firm’s turnover also grew by 13.4%, from £47.4m to £53.7m. \nThe company said its business had not been impacted by the Brexit vote and added that the Government’s Autumn Statement was a positive announcement for the firm. \nIn the company accounts, joint managing partner Stephen Richardson said: “The positive trading environment and general buoyancy of the construction sector within the last 12 months, was thrown into uncertainty in the wake of the Brexit referendum vote decision in June 2016 for Britain to leave the EU. A road traffic sign in front of the Union Jack and the European Union flag \n“However, as the months passed, there was little evidence of any negative impact and the sector has been boosted by the positive announcement in the Autumn Statement of 2016 by the government to invest in housing, transport, and infrastructure amongst others.” \nJames Burrell’s growth was not just limited to its financial figures, with the firm also hiring an extra eight members of staff in its selling and distributions teams. The builders merchant now employs 184 people across its eight stores and sole accounts office. \nThe increase in headcount contributed to an increase in the firm’s staffing costs, which grew from £5.02m to £5.42m. \nMr Richardson added: “James Burrell believes in investing in its people. Staff retention remains high and as a family owned and run business continues to promote a people focused culture to attract high calibre individuals. \n“In the meantime, the business strategy is to maintain and grow existing market share with expectation for continued double digit growth in both turnover and profitability and to remain as the leading independent builder’s merchant market leader in the area, outperforming the market.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T00:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T20:31:50.251+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
