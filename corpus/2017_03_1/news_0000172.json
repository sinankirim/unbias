A survey of businesses from Cornwall to Bath has revealed the newest developments that will be leading the way for 2017. And the results, compiled by Tech South West, has revealed high levels of optimism in the sector. \nSouth West Tech Trends 2017 \n1 Virtual Reality / Augmented Reality \n1 Internet of Things \n9 Video - interactive, live streaming \n10 Health tech \n12 Agile working through tech \n12 Robotics \nEngineered Arts Ltd was founded in October 2004 by Director, Will Jackson and specialises in robotics, above . \nTechnology is the region's fastest growing sector, worth £2.8bn in 2015 and expected to be worth £4.2bn in 2020. There are already more than 10,900 technology companies in the South West employing over 126,000 people. \nRead next: Why prosperity in Devon and Cornwall can't wait for government hand outs \nPhilip Letts, Tech South West Chairman and CEO of blur Group in Exeter, said: \"It's clear that there is genuine and sustainable growth across the tech sector in the South West combined with high levels of optimism that look set to continue. \"Like all businesses, there are of course concerns about Brexit and what it will mean specifically for the technology sector. Many of our members are trading internationally, and rely on brilliant talent wherever that may be. The Government's recent publication of its Industrial Strategy was encouraging, putting a strong emphasis on technology and the regions. But there is a long way to go before we can judge the success of that. Tech South West will continue to push for a fair Brexit that ensures our region's technology companies, vital to the overall economy of the region, can thrive.\" \nWhat is the Internet at Things? It means connecting devices over the internet, letting them talk to us, applications, and each other. The most common is in home heating and energy use where you can control your heating with an app on your phone when you are not at home \nCarried out by Tech South West, the survey found that 80% of technology firms in the region believe 2017 will be a better year, with greater growth, than 2016, with no business expecting this year to be worse than last. Tech South West has more than 500 members across the region and acts as a champion for the sector. \nThe survey, which featured organisations based in Bath, Bristol, Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Gloucestershire and Somerset, also found that 72% of those who responded expect their recruitment of new employees in 2017 to outstrip the previous year, with just 6% anticipating a potential reduction in their workforce. \nRead next:   \nBut despite the optimism, there are longer-term concerns about Brexit, with 35% admitting that the vote to leave the European Union and subsequent economic and political uncertainty has already had a negative impact on their business, although 6% say they have benefited from the decision, whilst 59% have seen no difference to their business.
