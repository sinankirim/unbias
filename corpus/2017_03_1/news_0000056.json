Everything you need to know after the Prime Minister announced the date she will submit a letter to formally begin the UK's exit from the EU Share Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now Theresa May confirms she'll trigger Article 50 on March 29 Share this video   \nThe Prime Minister has set the date to fire the starting gun on Britain’s departure from the EU. \nTheresa May’s letter officially notifying the European Council of the UK’s intention to quit will be sent on March 29 and will set in train a two-year negotiation process expected to lead to Britain leaving the EU by March 29 2019. \nThe letter has also put an end to speculation of an imminent general election. \nHere we’ve taken a look at what will happen next and what it will mean for Britain. What happens next? \nThe announcement means that Mrs May will meet her self-imposed deadline of the end of March to get the withdrawal process under way. \nIn the run-up to May 29, Mrs May is expected to continue her series of visits in all four nations of the UK. \nOn the day itself, she will take part in the regular Wednesday lunchtime session of Questions to the Prime Minister - and then deliver a special statement to MPs. \nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk will prepare a response. He said on Twitter: “Within 48 hours of the UK triggering Article 50, I will present the draft Brexit guidelines to the EU27 member states.” \nAnd he will arrange an extraordinary summit of the remaining 27 EU member states. \nThat summit will draw up a mandate for the European Commission’s chief negotiator, Belgian diplomat Michel Barnier, probably allowing talks to begin in earnest in May. How does the Prime Minister trigger Article 50? Prime Minister Theresa May discusses Brexit with Welsh leaders (Photo: PA) \nThe Prime Minister will send a letter to Mr Tusk, though Downing Street has not not make clear whether this will be a physical letter or whether it might be sent electronically. \nIt will be the first time that the provisions of Article 50 - which sets out the process for any EU member state “to withdraw from the Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements” - have been activated. When will negotiations start? \nDetailed talks are unlikely to begin until mid April at the earliest, and probably not until May. \nMr Barnier has been appointed the EU’s chief negotiator, but he will take instructions from the leaders of the remaining 27 EU countries, or so-called EU27. \nThe Brexit talks can only start once the EU27 have met. The European Parliament also has to give the go-ahead for the talks. Who will lead the talks? Brexit Secretary David Davis \nThe negotiations will be overseen by Theresa May and led by David Davis, the Secretary for State for Exiting the EU. \nMost of the heavy lifting will be done by Oliver Robbins, the permanent secretary at the Department for Exiting the EU, Sir Tim Barrow, our ambassador to Brussels, and his deputy Shan Morgan.

How long will the Brexit negotiations take? \nOnce Theresa May has triggered Article 50 there are two years to complete the negotiations. \nBut Mr Barnier has said that in reality there will be just 18 months. \nThe talks have to be completed in time for the European Parliament and the European Council to ratify them. \nThis means the talks will have to finished by October 2018. Will they be done in that time? A road traffic sign in front of the Union Jack and the European Union flag \nIt is thought unlikely that a full agreement could be struck before October 2018. This means that the UK may need some sort of transitional deal with the EU, which would be put in place while talks on a final agreement continue. What are the key issues likely to be? \nThe Prime Minister hopes to obtain a trade deal giving the UK full access to the European Single Market. \nBut any new trade deal requires an unanimous vote of all 27 countries and most likely the approval of their national and, in some countries, regional parliaments. \nA free trade between Canada and the EU was almost derailed at the last moment because the Walloon region of Belgium objected to the terms . \nThe UK’s divorce bill could also dominate the early negotiations, \nThe EU27 could ask the UK to pay billions. How have the politicians reacted? Tim Farron (Photo: PA) \nDavid Davis, the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, said: “Last June, the people of the UK made the historic decision to leave the EU. Next Wednesday, the Government will deliver on that decision and formally start the process by triggering Article 50. \n“We are on the threshold of the most important negotiation for this country for a generation. \n“The Government is clear in its aims: a deal that works for every nation and region of the UK and indeed for all of Europe – a new, positive partnership between the UK and our friends and allies in the European Union.” \nLiberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said: “Theresa May is embarking on an extreme and divisive Brexit. She has rushed this through without a plan, and without a clue. \n“On the day Theresa May is travelling the country claiming she wants to bring the United Kingdom together, she lets it be known she is about to unleash division and bitterness. \n“She has chosen the hardest and most divisive form of Brexit, choosing to take us out of the Single Market before she has even tried to negotiate. That’s why we believe the people should have the final say over the Conservative Brexit deal. \n“Membership of the Single Market is vital for the British economy and for the jobs of millions of British people. Leaving the Single Market was not on the ballot paper in the referendum, it is a political choice made by Theresa May. \n“Meanwhile, with the country in desperate need of an Official Opposition, Labour has declared war on itself rather than defending the people from a hard Brexit.” Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T01:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T21:17:10.849+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
