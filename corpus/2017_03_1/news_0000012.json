Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA pro-Europe march is to take place in Newcastle on Saturday which organisers hope will be the biggest event of its kind in the region. \nSupporters from across the country and the political divide are expected to gather for the start at the Newcastle City Pool at 12pm. \nThey will then march to the Monument in Grey Street and listen to speeches from a number of high profile speakers like world renowned philosopher and author Professor AC Grayling and former North East Labour MEP and Minister for Europe Joyce Quin. \nThe North East for Europe group which has organised it said they wished to show solidarity with fellow EU citizens living in the North East who are concerned about their right to live and work here. \nThe march follows the defeat of the government’s Brexit bill the House of Lords last week which said ministers should guarantee EU nationals’ right to stay in the UK after Brexit. Grey's Monument on Grey Street, Newcastle \nThe vote, by 358 to 256, is the first Parliamentary defeat for the government’s Brexit bill. \nHowever, MPs will be able to remove their changes when the bill returns to the House of Commons. \nAnd a spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said she remained “committed” to meeting the deadline to trigger Article 50 by the end of March. \nHe said: “Our message to MPs is that we expect this bill to go through unamended. \n“MPs voted it through unamended and we expect that to be the case.” \nMs Quin - now Baroness Quin - was in the Lords for the vote. \nShe said: “I voted for the amendment. The Lords is a revising chamber and doesn’t block legislation and the reality is the government will get its legislation through.

A lot of people voted to keep many of our links.” Read More \nHowever, her views appear to be at odds with her fellow speaker at the Newcastle event Prof Grayling, judging by comments he made about Brexit this week. \nProf Grayling said: “The growing number of people who have grave reservations about Brexit should be heard. \n“If the choice is between a poor Brexit deal and no deal, the national interest requires decision-makers to rethink a deeply damaging course of action.
