Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nPrime Minister Theresa May has been accused of putting at risk a £60 million EU loan to create thousands of North East jobs. \nThe European Investment Bank (EIB) is considering an application for £60 million to go towards the £145m North East Fund, which will provide loans and investment to firms in the region. \nBut there are reports that the money could be withheld because Mrs May is demanding the return of £9bn of UK assets currently held by the EIB. \nIt’s part of the Government’s attempts to reduce the UK’s bill for leaving the EU when Brexit takes place. \nConcerns were raised by Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron. He said: “This government is jeopardising vital investment for the North East through its reckless approach to Brexit. \n“Ministers have refused to guarantee future regional funds post-Brexit, now they are risking a £60m loan by unnecessarily antagonising our European partners. \n“It is a short-sighted approach that risks short-changing the North East. \n“You can’t have a hard Brexit and the investment we need to create a strong, stable economy.” European Union flag in front of Big Ben \nThe North East Fund was created by the Department for Communities and Local Government and seven North East councils, and is expected to provide support for 600 businesses and create up to 3,500 jobs. \nAccording to the European Investment Bank, the bid for £60 million is currently under appraisal. \nMeanwhile, Mrs May has urged MPs to stop describing Brexit as a divorce - because it suggests the UK and European Union will be on bad terms after they split.
