It claims to be a programme celebrating rural life but it's all a cunning ruse - possibly - argues Mike Kelly Share Countryfile presenter Matt Baker (Photo: BBC) Share     \nWell, who would have thought it? \nCountryfile, presented by Easington’s finest Matt Baker, is one of the most controversial programmes on TV at the moment. \nIt has become a threat to all we hold dear what with its blatant anti-Brexit agenda, wilfully at odds with all that is good and wholesome in the United Kingdom. And the rest. \nThe programme, of which I am a fan, has been caught up in the tail-wind of another artificial storm whipped up by those who would have us believe that all will be well in post-Brexit Britain and there is nothing to fear. \nTo speak otherwise is to be met with the full force of the totalitarian requirements of the Daily Mail on the issue before which all true Tories must abase themselves. BBC logo at Broadcasting House \nAs a result, when the BBC reveals the concerns of people and business about leaving the EU led by a Government which doesn’t seem to have a coherent plan how to do so, it is anti-Brexit bias - not a news story. \nAnd when last Sunday Countryfile broadcast an item about the concerns of farmers losing their EU workers due to insecurity about their status in the UK as a result of the vote, it is not highlighting the worries of its core viewers, it is doing Britain down. \nI watched the Countryfile programme which was a follow up to a National Farmers Union report presented to the House of Lords which said that while in the first three months of 2016, 100% of labour providers were able to recruit the right number of seasonal workers, by the end of June, after the referendum, this had already fallen to 87%. \nBy the end of September it had dropped to just 40%. \nThis could blow out of the water many rural and farm businesses which made the issue imperative for Countryfile to look into.

Their number included Berwick MP Anne-Marie Trevelyan which I was a bit surprised at. Having met her I thought her above such herd following antics. \nThe letter condemned the BBC for its “unfair” and “pessimistic” coverage of Brexit and demanded BBC managers “take steps to correct these flaws in the BBC’s coverage of our EU exit”.
