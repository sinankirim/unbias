Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nMars is shrinking bags of some of Britain’s favourite chocolate treats by up to 15% and Cadbury has indicated it could reduce the size of its products too. \nThe confectionery giants say size slashes are a response to rising production costs. \nMars has already started cutting packet sizes of Maltesers, M&Ms and Minstrels. A share bag of M&Ms is now 25g lighter, at 140g, while Minstrels and Revels packs have been trimmed by 10%. \nMaltesers packets have been cut in size for the second time in a year. \nIn autumn, bags of Maltesers were reduced from 121g to 103g, and will now weigh just 93g, the Guardian reports. \nBut the customers will pay the same price as before. \nMars, which has a factory in Slough, Berkshire, says cuts are due to increasing in costs. A Mars spokesman told the Guardian: “We have been absorbing rising raw material and operational costs for some time, but the growing pressures mean that we can’t keep things as they are. \n“Reducing the size of our products is not a decision that we take easily.” \nWhy Mars bars, Twix, Kit Kats and your other favourite chocolate bars may soon cost over £1 \nPrices of every day commodities have increased for UK customers since the Brexit vote, due to a slump in the pound’s value. \nThere is also increased demand for chocolate in countries like Brazil, Russia and China, while the Ivory Coast’s cocoa harvests have been less fruitful in recent years, according to MySupermarket. These factors combine to make chocolate more expensive to British customers.
