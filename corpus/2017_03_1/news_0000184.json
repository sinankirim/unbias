It follows the conviction of Rezzas Abdulla, 33, from Imeary Street in South Shields, who was convicted of racially aggravated common assault after spitting on a nine-month-old baby in a pram. \nA court heard Abdulla said “white people shouldn’t breed” before walking off. He received an eight-month prison sentence, suspended for 10 months. \nCritics accuse the English Defence League of exploiting individual incidents to try to stir up hatred against Muslims in general. \nSpeaking in the House of Commons, Mrs Lewell-Buck highlighted figures from Northumbria Police showing reported incidents of race hate crime were 48% in three months after EU referendum compared to same period before the vote. \nShe said: “Race hate crime in the North East is up by 48% since Brexit, and the English Defence League is to march again in South Shields this weekend. \n“My constituents and I have always challenged extremism, and such groups are not welcome in South Shields, yet the process to have such marches banned is complex and arduous. \n“Will the Government make a statement on what they are doing to stem the rise of racially charged demonstrations, which have no place in Britain?” \nConservative Cabinet Minister David Lidington also condemned the EDL and accused them of spreading “venom and hatred”.

A balance has to be struck between the rights of freedom of expression and freedom to demonstrate, which we all cherish in the United Kingdom - and they cannot be only for the people with whom we agree - and the importance of demonstrating our rejection of extremist groups. \n“My view is that the best way to respond to the EDL or similar groups is for the entire community to speak and to show in their actions that they utterly reject and are repelled by the venom and hatred that those groups seek to sow in our society. \n“In particular, those of us in leadership positions should show solidarity with the minority groups who feel so threatened.” \nSeven people were arrested when the EDL held a march in South Shields in 2013.
