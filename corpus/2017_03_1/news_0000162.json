By HannahFinch | Posted: March 30, 2017 By By Debora Aru 0 COMMENTS SHARES Donald Tusk has Theresa May's letter in his hand. But what will Brexit mean for us? ​What sectors would be most affected by Brexit? X \nCopy link to paste in your message / Comments (0) \nCar-making and other manufacturing will be the industries most affected by Brexit in the South West. By triggering Article 50, PM Theresa May officially started the formal process of leaving the European Union, which will lead Great Britain out of the European single market. \nOfficial figures show 41% of exports from the South West currently end up in the EU. The South West exported £21.5bn globally in 2016, and £8.9bn of that came from trade with the European Union. \nCar-making, which accounts for almost two-third of the total exports, or 69%, is likely to suffer more from Brexit. In 2016, the South West exported machinery and transport equipment with a £14.9bn worth. \nOther manufacturing industries - such as prefabricated buildings, sanitary, furniture, footwear, professional, scientific and controlling instruments and apparatus - account for 12% of the total exports from England or £2.6bn. \nGiven that the government will be spending months trying to work out new post-Brexit trading arrangements with Europe, where could be possible alternative markets for the South West? \nNorth America is currently the second biggest trade partner. In 2016, exports to the North America accounted for 18% of the £21.5bn of global exports, or £3.8bn worth. \nOn Wednesday, during a press conference, the White House spokesman told reporters that Donald Trump was \"a leader in the effort to call for Brexit\". That would appear to put Great Britain in a strong position to boost trade with the North America in case of a so-called \"hard Brexit\". \nIn 2016, the UK exported goods globally worth £290.7bn, 49% of which ends up in the European Union, or £142.9bn. England's exports account for three quarters of the total, worth £221.1bn, with 48% of that from trade with European countries, or £106.8bn. \nCar-making industries accounted for the most exports to the EU, 41%, or £119.4bn. Manufacturing industries - such as prefabricated buildings, sanitary, furniture, footwear, professional, scientific and controlling instruments and apparatus - followed, accounting for 14% of £290.7bn, £41.9bn worth. \nNorth America is the next biggest trade partner. In 2016, England exported £51bn worth of goods to the North America, or 18% of £290.7bn. \nFigures in £ million - Exports by SITC \nSection 2016 \n0 Food and Live Animals // 592 \n1 Beverages and Tobacco // 124 \n2 Crude Materials // 472 \n4 Animal and Vegetable Oils // 11 \n5 Chemicals // 980 \n7 Machinery and Transport // 14,888 \n8 Miscellaneous Manufactures // 2,597 \n9 Other commodities nes // 180 \nTotal Exports // 21,489 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T00:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T20:52:15.386+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
