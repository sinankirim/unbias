Could   \nA group of 72 MPs have condemned the BBC for its “unfair” and “pessimistic” coverage of Brexit . \nNorthumberland MP Anne-Marie Trevelyan was one of those criticising the broadcaster. \nThey signed a letter demanding BBC managers “take steps to correct these flaws in the BBC’s coverage of our EU exit”. \nBut the MPs came under fire from Labour, which demanded that Prime Minister Theresa May step in to defend the BBC’s independence. \nThe letter, sent to BBC Director General Tony Hall, said the BBC has fallen “far short” of its obligation to provide balanced coverage, warning “if politicians and the public don’t view it as an impartial broker, then the future of the BBC will be in doubt”. \nThe MPs claimed the BBC had “skewed” good economic news since the June referendum, adding: “So-called ‘despite Brexit’ reporting may be expected of a partisan press, but licence fee-payers have the right to expect better.” \nThey added: “The BBC has a much larger market share than any newspaper - it runs the most-used news website in the country, on top of its television and radio coverage. \n“This, as well as viewers’ belief in its neutrality, means that BBC bias can have a substantial effect on the national debate. \n“BBC coverage also shapes international perceptions of the UK: we fear that, by misrepresenting our country either as xenophobic or regretful of the Leave vote, the BBC will undermine our efforts to carve out a new, global role for this country. \n“We are therefore asking you to take steps to correct these flaws in the BBC’s coverage of our EU exit at the earliest moment.” \nMost of the MPs signing it were Conservatives, but three Labour MPs, eight DUP MPs, two DUP peers and UKIP’s only MP, Douglas Carswell, also added their names. Conservative MP for Berwick Anne-Marie Trevelyan \nMrs Trevelyan said the MPs wanted the BBC to give both sides of the story. \nShe said: “Why is it that the BBC are always so negative? \n“We want our major broadcasters to look at all sides of the question. \n“Too often, they will give air time to the negative side of the argument and not look at the alternative views. \n“Now that we are at the point of actually triggering article 50, we felt there was a need to highlight that we feel they are not giving a balanced position. \n“Brexit is what this nation is going to do, and therefore such an important broadcaster needs to ensure they are giving a fair and balanced perspective and the arguments on all sides.” Read More There's no way Theresa May will walk away from the talks without a deal on Brexit \nBut Tom Watson, Labour’s Shadow Culture, Media and Sport Secretary, said Mrs May and the Government’s Culture Secretary, Karen Bradley, should defend the BBC. \nHe said: “The BBC is one of the world’s finest news broadcasters and we should all value its impartiality, integrity and balanced coverage. It is the BBC’s job to report the facts, not to be a cheerleader for any cause or party. \n“All politicians sometimes dislike the way some stories are covered, but we should never seek to interfere with the independence of the BBC by publicly accusing it of bias and making implicit threats about its future.

It is what the BBC will continue to do. It is precisely because of this that the public trusts the BBC.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T18:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T13:48:49.986+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
