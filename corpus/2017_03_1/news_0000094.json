Could   \nThe North East will among the hardest hit if the European Union refuses to agree a major trade deal with the UK after Prime Minister Theresa May triggers Article 50 on Wednesday. \nA leading think tank said the North East and London had the most to lose among the regions of England if “hard Brexit” takes place. \nThe warning came from emos as Mrs May prepares to begin the process of leaving the EU . Prime Minister Theresa May (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \nShe is expected to continue her tour of the nations of the UK with a visit to an English region on Tuesday, having spoken in Wales last week and Scotland on Monday. \nMeanwhile, Labour has warned it will “not support” a deal with the EU unless it meets a series of conditions including providing the UK with the “exact same benefits” as the country currently enjoys as members of the Single Market and Customs Union. \nDemos found that the North East would be particularly affected if the UK left the EU without a substantial trade deal. This is because the region, with ports connected to the North East, is a major exporter to the European Union. \nMore than 60% of North East exports go to EU countries, Demos said. \nAnd the region also benefits more than many other parts of the country from EU funds. \nThe Demos report said: “EU regional policy affects areas differently. The EU distributes regional structural funds to reduce inequality, and so some less prosperous areas of the UK – Wales, Northern Ireland, Scotland, South West and North East – stand to lose.” Port of Tyne docks, South Shields (Photo: Newcastle Chronicle) \nLondon could suffer from Brexit for a different reason, as it is particularly reliant on skilled Labour from EU countries, Demos said. \nSpeaking in East Kilbride, Scotland, Mrs May confirmed her ambition of avoiding a “hard Brexit” and instead forging new agreements with the EU while also building relationships with the rest of the world. \nShe said: “I want to make it absolutely clear as we move through this process that this is not – in any sense – the moment that Britain steps back from the world. \n“Indeed, we are going to take this opportunity to forge a more global Britain. The closest friend and ally with Europe, but also a country that looks beyond Europe to build relationships with old friends and new allies alike.” \nThe Prime Minister also insisted that the deal struck with the EU must work for all nations of the UK, and the UK as a whole. \nIt follows the announcement by the SNP, which controls the Scottish Government, that it will wants a new referendum on Scottish independence. \nMrs May said: “When this great union of nations – England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland – sets its mind on something and works together with determination, we are an unstoppable force.
