SHARES More than 100 Leicestershire jobs at risk 1,000 jobs at risk as shoe chain enters administration X \nCopy link to paste in your message / Comments (0) \nDiscount shoe retailer Brantano has gone into administration for the second time in a year. \nSome 1,086 jobs are at risk after the business was hit by factors including the drop in the value of sterling following the Brexit vote. \nA weaker pound means the cost of imports has gone up. \nThe Hinckley based business operates 73 stores and 64 concessions across the UK. \nIt has 18 stores and 14 concessions within the Midlands employing 244 people. \nCloser to home it employs 33 people in stores and concessions in Leicestershire, including in Beaumont Leys, Coalville, Glenfield and Oakham. \nThe Wheatfield Way head office in Hinckley has an additional 71 staff. \nThe shops continue to operate but job losses are said to be \"inevitable\". \nTony Barrell and Mike Jervis of PwC were today appointed as joint administrators. \nBrantano Retail was acquired by a Mayfair-based Alteri Investors in February 2016, but has experienced difficult trading conditions, despite \"sustained efforts and streamlining to make it more commercially viable\". \nPwC said: \"A sale of the company was explored and whilst it generated interest, unfortunately it has not been possible to achieve. \"This has resulted in the company being placed into administration.\" \nTony Barrell, lead administrator at PwC, said: \"Despite significant improvements in the business and reductions in the cost base, trading has continued to suffer in a depressed and competitive footwear market. \n\"Like many other retailers, Brantano has also been hit hard by the sharp decline in sterling, the ongoing shift in consumer shopping habits and the evolution of the UK retail environment. \n\"The administrators are continuing to trade the business as normal whilst assessing the trading strategy and any interest in parts of the business over the coming days and weeks. \n\"However, regrettably, it is inevitable that there will be redundancies. \n\"Staff will be paid their arrears of wages and salaries, and will continue to be paid for their work while the business is in administration.\" \nMr Barrell was previously brought in to run the company in January last year when changing consumer habits first took their toll – as shoppers moved away from traditional 'bricks and mortar' stores. \nThe original Brantano business started out in Belgium with a small factory run by André Brantegem and his brother, the sons of a cobbler. \nFollowing the 2016 administration a company controlled by retail restructuring business Alteri Investors – which was also the previous owner – bought a total of 140 stores and concessions. \nLast summer Brantano relocated from headquarters in Coalville to its new offices in Hinckley.
