She has correctly asserted the importance of focusing our time, energy and resource on securing the best deal for the whole of the United Kingdom. \nThis means, providing certainty for EU citizens in the UK, and UK citizens in EU nations at the earliest possible opportunity. This is why I raised this directly with the Prime Minister and received her personal reassurance on this matter. \nThe Government's 'Plan for Britain' will change the way our country works to ensure it works for everyone. \nA Global Britain that is outward-looking, where success is based on merit, drive and ability; not on privilege. \nCentral to achieving this vision, is making sure we maintain the Union of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. \nThis is a Union going back over 300 years, which has been an overwhelming success for all of us, here in Leicester and Leicestershire and indeed across the UK. \nRead more: Street cordoned off by police after reported stabbing \nWhilst antagonists from the SNP seek to spread divide and discord, it is important that each of us, continues to fight to protect Great Britain. \nIt is OUR country, not that of the separatists. Let us not be fooled. They wish to end Great Britain during Brexit and we must fight to strengthen our country. \nIt is now more important than ever, that the country unites behind our Prime Minister as she leads our negotiations with the EU. \nI hope and indeed expect that with her strong leadership and the right Plan for Britain, we will implement the democratic will of the people, get a good deal with our European allies and move forward as a stronger United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
