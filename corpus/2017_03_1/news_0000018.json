The British Government is not speaking on behalf of 65 million people, and they talk about the will of the people to do with Brexit. \n“We’re here to demonstrate there are other voices, and those voices are being silenced by the media and the politicians. \n“We are here to stand along with our friends, our colleagues, our loved ones, who are EU nationals, and we’re here to say we don’t agree with them being used as bargaining chips in this whole scenario.
