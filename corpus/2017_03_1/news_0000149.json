European Council President Donald Tusk (Photo: AP Photo/Virginia Mayo) \nIt’s a level of uncertainty which has made Lina consider leaving her new home. \n“For me, uncertainty is the biggest issue right now. \n“We don’t know exactly what is going to happen, no one is sure exactly what Brexit will look like. \n“That worries me and I’m considering leaving the UK because of it.
