X \nCopy link to paste in your message / Comments (0) \nLeicestershire County Council leader Nick Rushton has described the Liberal Democrats as \"slimeballs\" in a speech to Tory councillors and candidates. \nCoun Rushton rounded on his rivals ahead of the May 4 election as he launched the party's manifesto today. \nHe said of the Lib Dems, who make up the council's main opposition group: \"They are slimeballs. They will just lie. \n\"They lie and they cheat and they have a policy for every side of the road. \n\"The Liberals are absolutely desperate. They have no policies, no strategies.\" \nLeicestershire County Council elections 2017: Click HERE for everything you need to know \nHe added: \"They are dishonest and they are financially incompetent. \n\"We can't be remoaners like the stupid Liberals. \n\"We have to get in with it (Brexit) and get the best deal available.\" \nHe went on to say Labour was in \"serious difficulty\" and UKIP was a busted flush. \nLib Dem opposition group leader councillor Simon Galton said the leader's comments demonstrated how concerned he was about the challenge he faced. \nHe said: \"It is clear they (the Tories) see us as the main opposition. \n\"We feel optimistic. The mood is changing. We have moved on from the Coalition years with the Tories. \n\"We will fight this election by attacking the policies, not the personalities. \n\"We will run a positive campaign, but we will expose the 16 years of Tory control. \n\"They still have Â£60 million of savings to find, but have already done a handbrake turn on cuts to rural bus subsidies. \n\"It's disappointing that Nick says these things and there's some forked tongue because he was only saying in council this week how well he had worked with me and (Labour group leader) Robert Sharp.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T16:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T15:23:32.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
