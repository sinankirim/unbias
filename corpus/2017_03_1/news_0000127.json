We might now say similarly that “to Brexit or not to Brexit” is no longer a question. \nThe Prime Minister has been clear that “Brexit means Brexit” and the Brexit Bill is now law. The question is not if the UK leaves the European Union, but when. \nLet’s be clear. The Prime Minister has what she wanted. She campaigned for Remain, but settled for Brexit – and promised a short timetable for triggering it. Theresa May wanted to activate Britain’s departure from the EU at a time of her choosing without strings attached. \nMay’s ability to hang on as Home Secretary was matched only by her capacity to lose in courts – and this record of underachievement continues. Virtually every legal scholar I know was certain the government would lose its case on Brexit and they were vindicated twice, including by the UK Supreme Court. \nThe matter for judges was not whether Brexit should happen, but who was authorised to start it. The government said it had the ability to trigger Article 50 as it is authorised to handle treaty relations. As Article 50 was part of the Treaty of Lisbon, so it came under its control. British Prime Minister Theresa May \nThe successful counterargument was that triggering Article 50 would nullify an Act of Parliament and it would have an effect on domestic rights – and only Parliament was authorised to that. In other words, this was about more than Britain’s international dealings – it concerned domestic affairs. The critics were right. \nThe result was that the government could start Brexit, but it needed Parliament’s approval – and it needed it quickly to make Theresa May’s late March deadline. \nAll the signs remain that Brexit is something the Prime Minister doesn’t really want. She campaigned for Britain to Remain in the EU. Her legal case was acknowledged widely to be weak and thoroughly dismissed by the High Court in an unanimous verdict that should have ended matters. May then insisted on appealing to the Supreme Court, sticking with her weak arguments that were again dismissed. These actions delayed further getting on with the task of Brexiting that she so often publicly supports. \nBut, actually, she seemed more interested in finding a scapegoat – anyone or organisation – to blame for delaying or preventing Brexit moving forward. Ironically, all the while the biggest stumbling block to Britain’s Brexit is the government itself. \nParliamentary business scheduled for the start of the year was largely set aside as minds focused on what would – and what would not – be part of the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill, otherwise known as the Brexit Bill. The government wanted this short and sweet, resisting every attempt to amend it. They made promises to both the Commons and the Lords about EU nationals, UK science and trade and Parliament’s having a say on a final deal, but all without any specific amendment to the legislation. \nSo what this means in plain English is this. The government can break its promises to MPs and peers – it has no statutory strings attached. What it says in the House of Commons, it may be free to do otherwise despite promising something different. The whole affair makes a mockery of our Parliament and representative dem­ocracy. All those who feared Westminster “Remoaners” were hungry for a reason to reject the Bill can count the votes – and see the Bill was passed and the Leave scaremongering was more delusion than prophesy. European Union flag in front of Big Ben \nOne promise the Prime Minister might break is the vow that Parliament will have some kind of a meaningful vote on any final Brexit deal. It is simply outrageous that, under the banner of “take back control”, there may be 27 other EU countries debating and voting on Britain’s deal with Europe before anyone in Parliament outside of the government knows what the deal is. This isn’t control, but being taken for a ride. \nThere is a simple reason why Theresa May wanted no strings attached on the Brexit Bill: she has few cards to play and so everything is up for grabs. May’s Tory government is content to play politics with EU nationals already resident in the UK, despite whatever damage they might cause to Britain’s economy and future interests, because there isn’t much more they have to use. \nNo strings attached also means no excuses. Now that the government got what it wanted before it wanted to use it – the ability to trigger Brexit before the end of March – it must make people wonder why it is not yet willing to pull the starting gun. If Theresa May really wanted to act on the will of the people, she can do this now – so what is preventing her? \nIf I’m right and this is a move she doesn’t really want, there are two key things we should look out for. \nThe first is that Theresa May says no deal is better than a bad deal. She is willing to walk away from talks with the EU empty-handed if she doesn’t like what she sees. Her supporters remind us that Britain’s economy is too good for the EU to say no to and a beneficial deal will be on the cards. \nBut we learned only this week that, in fact, the government has made no risk assessment or any contingency plans for walking away from the table. Why? Well, I’m guessing because it’s all bluster and not a genuine option. We need trade with the EU at least as much, if not more, than they need it from us. No deal is not genuinely on offer. This seems verified by the fact the government has nothing in place should the EU call our bluff. Theresa May’s Brexit plans fails the test for negotiation strategy for beginners. \nWhy would the Prime Minister talk hard Brexit if she didn’t mean it and wasn’t planning for it? The simple explanation is there’s not much wiggle room for manoeuvre. No deal and no home for EU citizens is all she’s got.

By refusing any amendments to the Brexit Bill, the Prime Minister could deny Parliament a vote on a Brexit deal with Europe until after it was agreed by other EU leaders. There would be howls of protest in Westminster that might not be heard over Big Ben’s chimes, but a fait accompli where any critic of what the government conjured becomes an enemy of the people and opponent of “Brexit” in a classic case of political trickery. \nBut this is the second key thing to look out for – whether what is presented as “Brexit” is the Brexit the public voted for. It’s well-rehearsed that different campaigners said different things about why Britain should leave, from extra money to the NHS, a points-based immigration system and so on, much of which we have been told by 10 Downing Street won’t happen. \nI have no doubt that there will be a deal of some kind offered by the end of negotiations to be sold to the public. I would be unsurprised if Boris Johnson was wheeled out to help support its endorsement as satisfying his pro-Leave campaign pledges. The deal will go too far for some and not far enough for others.

The EU is more than a tariff-free market or customs union. We already know the Prime Minister intends for Britain to continue as a part of a shared security and counter-terrorism networks. Those wanting to scorecard the government should make a list of the UK’s membership in different EU organisations to see which we’re still in when the dust settles. \nIf Brexit means Brexit, it can mean anything. Remember, you saw it here first if this meant less than a full break. Britain may not become the new Norway, but don’t expect us to be the new Singapore either and on the outside looking in. If we really might be 100% out, the government would have planned for our walking away – so far they haven’t, and I’m confident they won’t. \nThom Brooks is head of Durham Law School and author of Becoming British (Biteback 2016) @thom_brooks Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T20:15:05.302+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
