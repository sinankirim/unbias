The retweet by North Tyneside Tory councillor Alison Austin (Photo: NEC) \nMartin Rankin, Labour councillor for the Collingwood ward, said endorsing the post was a “shocking error of judgement” by Coun Austin. \nHe said: “She seems to find merit in equating the actions of a serial killer with that of a former UK Prime Minister and in doing so she makes light of Peter Sutcliffe’s terrible crimes. \n“She should apologise immediately and consider her position.” Read More Yorkshire Ripper and Soham killer Ian Huntley in 'behind bars bust-up' at HMP Frankland \nThe charity Rape Crisis Tyneside and Northumberland also condemned the tweet. \nA charity spokesman said: “Whenever we hear stories of this nature, our first thought is ‘what impact will this have on women who have experienced sexual violence?’ \n“In her tweet, Alison Austin appears to have been endorsing a sarcastic political comment. Humour is easily misinterpreted and we do not think it is helpful for women who have experienced sexual violence to see humour used in this way.” \nHowever, Coun Austin defended her actions and said she did not mean to cause any offence. \nShe said: “I was not saying anything good about Peter Sutcliffe, saying that about him would be ridiculous. \n“It was not an endorsement and the guy was making a pertinent point [about Mr Blair]. I do not see anything wrong with the tweet.” Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T18:33:28.636+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
