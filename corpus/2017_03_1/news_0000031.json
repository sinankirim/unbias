Volumes fell again by 4.8% in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. \nLSL said it saw a notable acceleration of transactions in first quarter of the year as the change in stamp duty regulations loomed, and that it “reacted decisively to the changing market conditions” in the second half of the year. \nIt paused its acquisition activity and carried out selective cost reduction measures, closing 21 of its 540 branches across the UK, including four in the North East. \nOverall, headcount was reduced from 5,181 to 4,991 but it invested in its lettings and financial services departments during the second half of the year, delivering growth of 9% in the lettings business and a 27% revenue rise in financial services. \nLooking ahead, LSL said the year has started positively in both divisions lettings and estate agencies, but that house sale volumes are expected to drop by around 4%.

Mortgage rates that consumers are paying are at historically low levels, and broadly the outlook for the UK economy is reasonably positive. \n“Our avergae operating profit per branch across the estate agencies was £30,000 and our strategy is to get that to £80,000 to £100,000. Our two main levers to do that are to continue to grow lettings revenues and continuing to grow financial services, and if we can be a little more cost effective we will look to do that. \n“It’s more about evolution not revolution, we’re not looking at major restructuring.” Read More Newcastle technology giant Sage buys HR specialists Fairsail \nChairman Simon Embley added: “Following a strong first half performance, the group delivered a resilient second half performance given the changing market conditions. I am pleased that we maintained revenue growth in both the estate agency and surveying divisions. \n“The group reacted decisively to the changing market conditions in the second half by taking selective cost measures and strengthening the balance sheet. \n“The business is well positioned to capitalise on market conditions to increase shareholder value.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T20:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T16:28:49.285+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
