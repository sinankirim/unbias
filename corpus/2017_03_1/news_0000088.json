A pint of Kronenbourg costing £3.09 is now £3.19. \nWetherspoons was one of the first pub companies to put breakfast on the menu as part of all-day opening as it fought back against the spread of high street coffee chains. \nAt one bar - in Oxted, Surrey - its breakfast deals have also gone up, with porridge rising from £2.39 to £2.45 and toast from £1.59 to £1.65. The pub chain, headed by pro Brexit campaigner Tim Martin , prides itself on offering food and drink that is cheaper than its rivals. \nREAD NEXT: Take a look at how Exeter's revamped JD Wetherspoon will be transformed \nBut one Wetherspoons customer said: \"He thinks we don't notice but he slips these increases in several times a year disguised as a 'new menu'. \n\"Ten pence on the price of a pint of Kronenbourg and the other lagers plus a few pence on everything on the food menu all adds up. \n\"They've put some balloons up to celebrate the release of the new menu but in reality we're paying for them.\" \nWetherspoons, with more than 900 pubs, angered some customers last year when it stopped serving Sunday roast. It said the move would allow pubs to concentrate on its all day menu, including breakfasts and gourmet burgers. \nWetherspoons spokesman Eddie Gershon said: \"We have introduced a new menu with some new products and there maybe some changes on food and drink prices. \n\"We aim to remain extremely competitive. However we will not comment on individual prices.\" \nDEVON NEWS:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T22:33:09.382+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
