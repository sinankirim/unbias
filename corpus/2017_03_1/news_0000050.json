Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nChancellor Philip Hammond’s first Budget was not the barnstorming appearance at the dispatch box we have come to expect from previous occupants of Number 11 Downing Street. \nDelivered very much in his understated style, with a few jokes but very few headline grabbing announcements, Mr Hammond’s Budget will be remembered for a £2bn promise for social care, changes to the tax regime for the self-employed and funding for transport infrastructure. \nMr Hammond was also keen to make the most of an unexpected upturn in the economy and say that the country could look forward to the Brexit process with confidence. \nBut aside from some new tax regulations and a few jokes at Jeremy Corbyn’s expense, what did the Budget mean for the North East? What is in it for us? \nNot much is the short answer. Mr Hammond seems determined to be different to his predecessor George Osborne, and refrained from pulling rabbits out of his hat with specific funding pledges for different parts of the country. \nThe North East was referred to only once, and the Northern Powerhouse barely mentioned. The Chancellor did announce £90m to tackle congestion on roads in the North, but there were no specifics about how much of that will come to the North East. How is the economy looking? \nAt present, pretty good. The Office for Budget Responsibility has upgraded its growth forecasts for the UK economy this year from 1.4% to 2%, while public sector borrowing estimates have been slashed by billions of pounds and real wages will rise through to 2020. \nBut Mr Hammond signalled there will be no end to austerity and with Brexit around the corner , this was a cautious Budget that recognised tougher times might be just around the corner. What did he do for the NHS? \nAfter not mentioning the NHS or social care at all in his Autumn Statement last year - and being widely criticised - Mr Hammond was not going to make the same mistake again. \nHe said hospitals will get £325m to implement their sustainability and transformation plans and another £100m will be put into a new triaging projects in England to help free up hospital beds. \nThe crisis-hit social care system will have another £2bn pumped into it over the next three years, with £1bn of this available in 2017/18. \nBut some commentators have pointed out that his £2bn is significantly less than the sum that has been removed from the social care under the Tories’ watch.

What did the Chancellor have to say about them? \nWith most of the rises in business rates coming in Tory constituencies in the south, Mr Hammond was under pressure to offer some help. \nHe announced a package of relief totalling £435m, with firms losing small business rate relief having their monthly increase capped at £50 for a year. Around 90% of pubs will be given a £1,000 discount on business rates in 2017, and councils will be given a £300m fund to deliver relief to small businesses. How else were business affected? \nThe big change came with new regulations for the self-employed. \nKeen to close a loophole that is being exploited particularly in the City, higher paid self-employed workers are to pay an average of 60p a week more in National Insurance contributions as part of changes to raise an extra £145 million by 2021-22. \nMr Hammond said the changes made the tax system more fair but his moves have already been criticised as an added cost on people trying to grow their own businesses - not least from some of his own MPs. And what about the important stuff: cigarettes and alcohol? \nThere was no change to previously planned upratings of duties on alcohol and tobacco, but a new minimum excise duty will be introduced on cigarettes based on a packet price of £7.35.
