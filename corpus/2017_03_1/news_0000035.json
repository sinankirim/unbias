This could connect Belmont in Durham with Fencehouses, Penshaw, Sunderland, South Hylton, Washington, Pelaw, South Shields and Newcastle.

And he will say Labour plans to invest in the economies of both the North of England and Scotland, in contrast to what Labour says are the austerity policies of the Tories and the SNP. \nHe will announce Labour’s to help unlock £30 billion of economic potential for the North, helping to create an extra 60,000 jobs across the whole region. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell (Photo: PA) \nSpeaking at Labour’s Regional Economic Conference in Newcastle, Mr McDonnell will say: “The potential of the North East is being wasted by this Conservative Government. \n“Whilst London receives half all transport investment made by the Government, the North East receives just 1.8 per cent of the total. \n“That’s almost £2,000 a head in London, but just £220 in the North East. \n“That funding gap has real consequences. It means that communities can’t prosper when they could.” \nLack of investment meant potential jobs were being not being created, he will say. \n“We need a new vision for the North-East. One that builds on its historic strengths, but looks to the future. \n“That recognises the potential for the North East as a great manufacturing and trading hub in a global world.
