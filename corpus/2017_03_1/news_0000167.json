Why would you want that to change? \n“The Premier League goes around the world and it’s ever expanding. \n“I don’t see a government doing something potty to disturb that.” Read More Sir Alex Ferguson: Newcastle's a great football area - Geordies travel well, that impresses me \nInterestingly, while other sectors may be affected by a tightening of immigration standards, Stoke owner Coates hopes the Premier League and EFL are excepted. \nCoates added: “We would expect footballers to be included in the exempt list- but we have to wait and see. \n“I think the Government’s got more on its hands than worrying about the Premier League. \n“They’ve no more idea than I have of what’s going to happen. \n“But hopefully football will find a way of looking after itself when it finally happens whenever that will be. \n“It could be years down the line.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T19:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T14:44:11.831+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
