And what does it all mean? \nWhat is Article 50? \nIt is a clause in the Treaty of Lisbon by which EU member states can invoke to formally commence the process of exiting the union. \nIt outlines the process for a member state quitting the union. \nWhen will it be triggered? \nPrime Minister Theresa May has said she intends to activate Article 50 on Wednesday. \nSo then Britain's out of the EU? \nNo, not even nearly. \nIt will mark the beginning of what is set to be a lengthy and complex set of negotiations between Britain and remaining EU members about the terms of Brexit. \nWhen will we actually leave then? \nTo be honest, nobody really knows. \nThe process is meant to take two years, so in theory Britain will be a former EU member by April 2019. \nOne high ranking EU official has said he thinks it might take a decade for Britain to extricate itself from the EU . \nWhat happens after Article 50 is triggered? \nIn a month, 27 leaders from the EU will hold a summit to discuss what they want out of Brexit negotiations. \nTheresa May will not be one of those round the table. \nIn May, the European Commission (corr) will publish negotiating guidelines based on the mandate the EU leaders give it. \nAfter that the negotiations will begin in earnest – on subjects such as trade, immigration, future foreign policy, laws, the rights of Britonsin Europe and EU nationals living in the UK and many others. \nWhat do we do during the negotiations? \nKeep calm and carry on. \nWe're still in the EU until we are legally out. \nBritain will still be in the single market and subject to all the EU laws and rules, including the freedom of movement. \nThe UK has, however, forfeited its rotating presidency of the European Council – which was scheduled for the second half of 2017 – to concentrate on Brexit negotiations. \nLegally, nothing prevents the UK from taking part in adopting EU acts that are unrelated to Brexit during the negotiation period. \nHowever, the UK cannot participate in the decisions taken by the council concerning Brexit negotiations. \nHow did it come to this? \nIn Leicester, people voted to remain in the EU but narrowly by 51.1 per cent to 48.9 per cent on a 65.1 per cent turn out. \nBut parts of the county voted overwhelmingly to leave the EU. \nIn Oadby and Wigston 55 per cent of voters opted to leave with 61 per cent in North West Leicestershire. \nIn Charnwood the Leave campaign secure 54 per cent of the vote and in Melton it was 58 per cent. \nSome 60 per cent of Blaby voters opted for Leave with 51 per cent in Harborough and Rutland. \nHinckley and Bosworth came out for leave by 60.3 per cent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T23:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T21:24:02.408+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
