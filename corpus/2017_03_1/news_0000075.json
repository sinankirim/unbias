It has to be acknowledged that, whether or not we voted to remain in or to leave the EU, it has been EU regulation that has forced us to clean up our coastlines; effecting change from a past where raw sewage was heedlessly pumped into our seas. \n“We would like to see 'Green guarantees' to make sure that environmental regulation remains at least as strong as current EU regulation and to ensure UK compliance with environmental regulation through an independent court. This approach is sensible both for our environment and for our town's core business.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T01:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T20:56:07.652+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
