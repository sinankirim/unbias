Could   \nBrexit ‘uncertainty’ is one of the reasons for the proposed closure of a Northumberland cosmetics factory – a senior whistleblower has claimed. \nThe explosive comments, from a senior figure at Coty’s Seaton Delaval operation, will be used by Blyth Valley MP Ronnie Campbell in a Commons debate on Wednesday as he moves against proposals which could result in the loss of more than 400 jobs. \nThe source said one reason for the proposed shut down was because of ‘ Brexit uncertainty’ as well as raising a series of issues that some feel cast doubt on the fairness of the decision which will have a devastating effect on the community. \nThe senior executive repeated claims made to the Chronicle that despite the Seaton factory being the second cheapest to run of the company’s European premises, it was earmarked for closure because it was cheaper to shut down, in part because it was non-unionised. \nThe whistleblower also talked of Coty, which makes upmarket beauty products and fragrances, benefiting from a big ‘tax write-off’ of high value assets if they close Seaton. \nAnd there was dismay that the company had no plans to sell the site if they moved out of Seaton in case, claimed the source, a competitor moved in. Blyth MP Ronnie Campbell (Photo: Newcastle Chronicle) \n“Put simply, this is a terrible decision based on a very short term outlook and is designed to penalise and damage the Seaton community in the most significant way possible,” said the source. \n“Not only will 450 people - myself included - lose their jobs, but at least 100 contractors in the local area will also lose significant business.” \nThe source said that Seaton was twice as productive as Coty’s factory in Cologne, Germany, and four times more productive than the one in Chartres, France, as well as having significantly lower salaries and pension costs. \n“Coty have made the decision to close Seaton not because of the cost of running the site but because of Brexit uncertainty and because out of all of the sites it has the cheapest shutdown costs - driven by lower redundancy payments and penalties for a non-unionised site,” Mr Campbell has been informed.
