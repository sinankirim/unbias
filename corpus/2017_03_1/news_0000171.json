The workforce crisis is going to do more damage in the short term than anything else.\" \nMr Bradshaw added: \"We need to have an honest conversation with the British pubic about how we fund this.\" \nHe called on Health Minister Philip Dunne to say whether the government had ruled out a \"posthumous levy\" on people's estates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T21:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T19:13:09.370+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
