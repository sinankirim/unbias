However, we have seen an improvement since the start of March. \n“We remain mindful that the group still faces the key Easter and May bank holiday trading periods and faces very strong comparatives during the remainder of the year. The board believes the business remains in a strong position to maximise opportunities as they arise and to grow market share. \n“Given the year to date performance of the business, the board currently expects results for the financial year to be in line with expectations.” \nScS increased its interim dividend to 4.9p, up from 4.67p the year before.

The company now trades from 100 ScS stores and operates 28 House of Fraser concessions. \nThe firm’s concession business brought in £12.8m, up 22.9% from £10.4m in 2016. Online sales also increased with gross sales from ScS’s e-commerce platform growing 25%, from £4.3m to £5.4m. \nScS describes itself as a seasonal business and the loss it makes in the first half of the year is not unusually for the firm.
