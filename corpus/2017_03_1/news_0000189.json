Similar events were held in Totnes and Plymouth. \nThe event, called Join Hands for Europe, was organised by campaign groups Labour Against Brexit and Devon for Europe. Attendees held hands to form a chain outside the Guildhall and held a minute's silence to consider their own thoughts. \nAfterwards people were invited to speak and a message of support was read from Ben Bradshaw MP. Mr Bradshaw voted against triggering Article 50 and has been outspoken in his views against Brexit. \nThe vigil's main organiser Emma Brennan is Labour candidate for Heavitree and Whipton Barton in May's Devon County Council election. She is also a co-founder of Labour Against Brexit, a national social media-based campaign run by volunteers, aiming to change Labour Party policy on Brexit and stop it altogether. \nEmma said: \"Theresa May says that she speaks for everyone in the country, and that we should all now be united behind Brexit. We came together this evening, as did groups throughout the country, to say that she does not speak for us. \n\"We will never be united behind an idea that was formulated by the likes of Nigel Farage and the Daily Mail, that is grounded in xenophobia, and that will impact negatively upon the most vulnerable people in our country, and on younger people.\" \nSimilar events were held outside town halls in Totnes, Plymouth and around the UK. \nWriting for DevonLive, Mr Bradshaw said on Wednesday: \"As the implications of such a dirty, chaotic Brexit or even the hard Brexit being pursued by Mrs May – outside the Single Market and Customs Union – begin to dawn, reality will bite. Businesses and sectors that face losing most from tariffs and non-tariff barriers and have so far remained quiet in the hope that the Government will negotiate them a special deal. But they will break their silence once they realise no special sectoral deals are on offer. \nRead more: Honest Exeter taxi driver wants to reunite owner with priceless watch found down back of seat \n\"As the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, has made clear to her own car makers and other manufacturers, maintaining the unity of the EU is more important to her and the other 26 than carving out and special deals for particular sectors. \n\"Those of us who oppose a destructive hard Brexit will be working flat out to hold the Government to account. Brexit Secretary David Davis promised in January we will enjoy the \"exact same benefits\" when we leave the European Union as we do now. I'll be holding him to that. \n\"There is a lot of water to flow under the Brexit bridge in the next 18 months and circumstances, including UK public opinion, could look very different then than they do now.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T19:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T15:58:18.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
