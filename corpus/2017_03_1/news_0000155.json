Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email Three supermarkets will cut fuel prices by up to 2p a litre in our region from today. \nTesco, Asda and Morrisons have all joined a national price war hoping to attract more drivers. \nThe move was hailed as good news by the motoring organisation RAC just in time for families to enjoy getting out in the warmer weather. \nSupermarket giant Asda said it will bring unleaded fuel to a new national price cap of 114.7p per litre (ppl) at its 301 filling stations, while diesel will cost consumers a maximum of 116.7ppl. \nMorrisons said it aims to drop prices for consumers at its 333 filling stations on Tuesday by up to 2p and keep them “far below the UK average”. \nTesco is also cutting prices for petrol and diesel by 2ppl at their 500 UK fuel stations. \nThis comes after months of price rises at the pumps as higher oil costs and the falling pound after the Brexit vote hit home.

No doubt other retailers will follow suit and we will see prices on every forecourt come down. \n“While this cut may come as a surprise to drivers, as prices at the pump have been going the wrong way for months, it has been on the cards for a couple of weeks. We’re very relieved retailers have acted without any need for outside encouragement.” Read More Serial petrol thief caught because of his fluorescent green shoe laces \nSupermarket bosses have explained the reasons behind the price cut. \nAsda’s head of petrol trading Dave Tyrer said: “Today’s latest move shows that Asda is once again leading the way in reducing the price at the pumps to help the millions of motorists across the UK. \n“Our new national price cap of 114.7ppl on unleaded and 116.7ppl on diesel will be welcomed by the millions of drivers who have seen fuel prices climb over the last 12 months.” \nRoger Fogg, Morrisons Services Director , said: “We will always aim to drop prices as soon as we can and always keep them far below the UK average.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T19:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T17:00:19.104+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
