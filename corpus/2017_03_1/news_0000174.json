Surely that’s really going to help us as we leave the EU?” \nFellow Tory Julian Sturdy, who led the debate, said: “I applaud that and I think it’s an excellent idea, and I hope the minister certainly takes that point on board.” \nAt the end of the debate, Mr Eustice said: “She raised the issue of online shopping. Just briefly, I can say that we are discussing this with the NFU and it may be one of the ways that we can avoid voluntary principles.” \nEnvironment, Food and Rural Affairs select committee chairman Neil Parish raised the issue of Angus beef. \nHe said: “There is a very big chain in this city and others which sell Angus beef. \n“Now, I suspect that beef is not Aberdeen Angus from either Scotland or the rest of the United Kingdom, but I suspect most of it is South American Angus beef.
