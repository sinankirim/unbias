Work is currently underway on trains for Great Western services \nThe North East faces a serious threat to its economy from the possibility of losing investment from Japan, Theresa May has been warned. \nIt follows the publication by the Japanese government of a 15-page document setting out its concerns about the future of investment in the UK after the decision to leave the European Union. \nHalf of all Japanese investment into the EU currently goes to the UK - and much of it comes to the North East, including the Nissan car plant in Sunderland and the Hitachi train factory in Newton Aycliffe , County Durham. \nSedgfield MP Phil Wilson said there was an urgent need for the Prime Minister to spell out exactly what “Brexit” means, and in particular whether the UK would continue to have full access to EU markets. \nOne of the benefits of investing in the UK at the moment is that products built here can be sold across the EU without restrictions, effectively giving a Japanese firm like Hitachi the benefits of EU membership. Views inside Hitachi train factory at Newton Aycliffe where new East Coast trains will be built. Work is currently underway on trains for Great Western services. \nIn an article for Progress, a Labour-supporting think tank, Mr Wilson said: “Japanese investment in the United Kingdom is important. Half of all Japanese investment to the European Union comes to this country, much of it to the north-east of England. The Japanese ambassador has called the region the ‘second home’ of Japanese investment. \n“6,700 direct jobs have been created at Nissan’s car manufacturing plant in Washington. There is Kamatsu in Birtley, Nifco in Stockton and of course Hitachi in my constituency, which has just opened its new train-building factory, creating at least 730 direct jobs with an £82m price-tag and representing the largest private sector investment in the north-east since Nissan arrived back in 1986.” \nThe Labour MP added: “So when the Japanese government issues a 15-page statement ahead of the G20 in China about the threat to future Japanese investment in the UK, I sit up and listen.” \nHe pointed out that the document warned some Japanese firms which currently have their European headquarters in the UK may decide to transfer their head office to Continental Europe. \n“This is serious. Hitachi’s global headquarters for rail is now in London. Its primary manufacturing plant is in the north-east, in Newton Aycliffe. But it also has a factory in Italy.” Video loading Click to play Tap to play The Live Event you are trying to watch is either unavailable or has not started Please refresh this page in your browser to reload this live event video \nHe said the North East could continue to win overseas investment but only if the Government came up with a plan. \n“We need a Brexit which promotes access to the EU marketplace to prevent jobs and investment leaving regions like the North East.” \nMr Wilson is also hoping to secure a House of Commons debate to quiz ministers over how Brexit will affect the North East. \nLiberal Democrats have also called on the Conservatives not to risk jobs at Nissan in Sunderland and Hitachi in County Durham after Japan said its companies will withdraw from Britain unless our free trade is guaranteed with the rest of Europe. \n“The government must give urgent re-assurance to Nissan and Hitachi that Britain’s number one priority is to remain part of the Single Market to protect jobs and grow our economy,” said Susan Kramer, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson. \nJapan’s Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, asked Theresa May to give more detail about her plans for Brexit, when the pair met during the G20 Summit in China. \nMr Abe told the British Prime Minister he attaches “extreme importance” to the relationship with the UK and reminded her of the level of Japanese investment in Britain, which is partly due to membership of the EU single market. \n“Prime minister Abe requested her co-operation to enhance predictability and to continue to secure Japanese companies’ businesses and value chains,” Japan’s ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement. \n“In response, Prime Minister May mentioned that she recognizes that the result of the UK referendum to leave the EU is having influence on the international community including Japan, and expressed her hope that the Japan-UK economic relationships will be maintained and strengthened.” \nJapan’s ambassador in London said he had spoken with executives at leading Japanese firms in the UK and none of them wanted to pull out. But he stressed that all options are open to the companies, which have a duty to their shareholders to remain profitable.
