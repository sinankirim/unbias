Bill MacLeod \nBut the firm, which employs more than 21,000 people across 64 offices in the UK, Channel Islands and the middle East, reduced average distributable profit per partner by 5% to £706,000 as it invested in people and technology, acquisitions and pay for non-partners. 08:20 Daniel Milligan Sharp slowdown for UK economy \nThe British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) has slashed its growth forecast for the UK in the light of the Brexit vote. \nIt now expects the UK to grow 1.8% this year, down from its March estimate of 2.2%, and by 1% in 2017 compared to its original forecast of 2.3%. \nUncertainty surrounding the UK’s negotiations over its EU exit would “dampen growth prospects”, while consumer spending will weaken, it said. \nHowever, it said the UK “would skirt with” but avoid a recession. \nThe forecast is the first made by the BCC since the EU referendum, and it warned that while it did not expect a recession businesses were still digesting the results of June’s EU referendum. \nIn total, the business group said its downgrades implied the UK economy would be £43.8bn smaller by the end of 2018 then it had expected before the EU vote. \nBut it said the slide in sterling since the vote should improve the UK’s net trade position. 08:14 Daniel Milligan \nHere are some of the latest shares prices as of 7am.
