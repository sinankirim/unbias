Ian Forsyth/Getty Images Jonathan Arnott, the EU Budget spokesman for the UK Independence Party \nMr Arnott said: “We have had the leadership contest and the first duty of those in the party is to unite behind the new leader and give them a chance to show what they are about. \n“Diane has a lot of positives, in particular her ability to portray policies in a positive way which will appeal beyond UKIP’s core demographic. \n“There is a huge opportunity for the party, but it also requites the party to unite.” \nHe added: “UKIP has a massive role to play in terms of ensuring Brexit means what it is supposed to mean. \n“And in the North we have a massive role in terms of appealing to the working class voters that Labour has abandoned.” \nOther candidates included former Stockton councillor and Eaglescliffe Tesco worker Phillip Broughton, a former professional wrestler who ran his own wrestling business. He came fourth.

Dan Kitwood/Getty Images Nigel Farage \nHe said he has given UKIP “absolutely all of me” as he revealed plans to tour Europe to foster Brexit-style “independence movements” now that he has stepped down as party leader. \nMr Farage said: “Today closes the chapter of what has been a very extraordinary few years. I honestly, looking back, could never really have dreamt that we would have achieved what we have. \n“I have put absolutely all of me into this. I literally couldn’t have worked any harder or couldn’t have been more determined. In a sense, I guess it has been my life’s work to try to help get this party to this point. \n“I frankly don’t think I could do any more. I think, folks, I’ve done my bit.” \nAs the crowd whooped and cheered, he said he will remain in politics touring Europe encouraging others to follow Britain out of the European Union. \nMr Farage received a standing ovation from the crowd, many of whom waved Union Flags and placards emblazoned with pictures of his face, as he left the stage played out to David Bowie’s Heroes. \nBut in a sign of the divisions within UKIP, outgoing deputy leader Paul Nuttall said he fears “for the very future of our party” unless the in-fighting that has racked the organisation is resolved. \nSpeaking in front of delegates in the conference hall, he said: “I will be frank at this point, because I can be now. UKIP has not been a happy camp for over a year, and the animosity has spilt over into the media. \n“No one, no one has emerged from this with their head held high.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-17T00:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-16T19:19:18.769+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
