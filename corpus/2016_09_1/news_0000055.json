With the North East the only region in the UK which exports more than it imports, this would appear to be a positive development. \n“However, this situation cannot last forever since the trading arrangements currently in place for UK companies selling abroad are likely to change once Britain leaves the EU. Also, the cost of capital equipment bought in by manufacturers to produce goods will be more expensive and so other costs will start to rise until the pound rises again. Fastest 50 \n“The vexed question of whether the UK will stay within the EU Single Market – and what happens if it does not – is also still to be addressed. This will have consequences not just for companies who concentrate on exports but for businesses across the region and the country as a whole. \n“Naturally, this will have quite an effect on which companies will be able to grow their businesses quickest – and by how much – which is the essence of the Ward Hadaway Fastest 50. \n“The companies that respond and adapt best are going to rise up the rankings over time – with the Fastest 50 looking over three years’ accounts, the performance trends will emerge over that period.” \nAs well as monitoring the health and progress of the North East economy via the Fastest 50 and helping clients deal with the impact of Brexit, Ward Hadaway has also been keeping tabs on global reaction to the referendum result – and how that could affect companies here. \nThe firm is a member of Geneva Group International – the world’s largest independent alliance of professional services firms – and invited fellow members around the globe to write about their reaction to Brexit and its potential effects on business in the UK and across the world. \nMr Hewitt said: “The results from Europe, the Far East, Australia and the US showed quite a wide variety of opinions, ranging from optimism about the potential for future increased trade to genuine fears about the future of foreign-owned companies in the UK. They can be seen on our website at http://www.wardhadaway.com/knowledge/brexit-view-abroad/ . \n“What the exercise also demonstrated is that Brexit is a subject of great interest to people working in the commercial sphere around the world and is something which they are all taking into account when considering future business and economic activity with the UK and British companies.
