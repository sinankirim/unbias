Photo credit: Philip Toscano/PA Wire De Montfort University art graduate's giant thumbs-up to Trafalgar Square X \nCopy link to paste in your message / David Shrigley unveils his 'Really Good', which has become the eleventh sculpture to be installed on Trafalgar Square's... \nTrafalgar Square's fourth plinth has been adorned with a piece of art created by former DMU graduate and Turner Prize nominee, David Shrigley. \nThe giant thumbs-up is the latest sculpture to grace the central London tourist hot-spot. \nIt was unveiled this morning by London mayor Sadiq Khan, who joked: \"I am 5'6\", so of course we wanted to find the tallest piece of art - and the tallest artist - we could.\" \nDavid, whose parents live in Oadby, was also the man behind \"the world's scariest\" football mascot, Partick Thistle's Kingsley. \nShrigley's much-talked about mascot, Kingsley \nNow, his latest work, title Really Good, is the 11th sculpture to feature on Trafalgar Square's fourth plinth. \nUnveiling the seven-metre black statue, which features a fist sticking up an elongated thumb, Mr Khan said he hoped it would help bring a sense of positivity to the city, particularly in the wake of the EU referendum result. \n\"I am an optimist,\" said the Labour mayor. \"But we have to recognise there has been some doom and gloom after Brexit, so this speaks to everyone.\" \nBut Mr Shrigley, who now lives in Brighton, was less certain about the message his piece delivers. \nHe said: \"I first said it was a piece to make the world a better place, which in a way is a ridiculous proposition because art is an inanimate object, it can't change the world. \n\"Originally it was an ironic statement, but when I come to analyse it, you've got to imagine that your work will make the world a better place. \n\"It's a very ambiguous work of art because with just that general gesture of approval you're invited to imagine what it's approving of - is it an approval to change things or is it an endorsement of the status quo? \n\"The debate that surrounds it will inform what the work is. \n\"I like the fact that the mayor has decided it's an optimistic thing, so I guess that's what it is, because the mayor said so. \n\"People will project their own meaning onto it, but I jokingly say to people 'It means everything - but it doesn't mean that'.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-30T02:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-29T22:20:14.282+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
