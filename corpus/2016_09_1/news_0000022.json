Owen Humphreys/PA Wire Workers at Nissan's plant in Sunderland \nDemand for new cars is up at home and overseas, with a 10.2% uplift in exports driving growth. \nProduction for the domestic market increased by 6.2% last month to 27,804, while export volumes grew to 81,200. \nIn the year-to-date, more than 877,523 cars have been built for international customers - 13.3% more than in the same period last year, which the SMMT said demonstrated the ongoing international appeal of British-built vehicles. \nMike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said: “August’s strong performance is good news for car makers and welcome news for the UK economy, which depends on this thriving sector for an increasing share of UK exports. \n“British car producers are exporting a diverse range of high quality, attractive new models that are in demand across the world thanks to multi billion pound investments made in UK plants over the past few years. \n“Future success depends on continued investment in plant and products, and that in turn depends on the UK maintaining internationally competitive business and trading conditions.” 08:40 100 new jobs created at call centre \nAround 100 new jobs have been created by an outsourcing firm based on South Tyneside . \nBoldon’s EC Outsourcing, which runs a contact centre specialising in the energy and utilities sector, has created 100 sales and retentions jobs on the back of strong results in the first quarters of the year. \nCommercial director Richard Knox said: \nOur ultimate goal is to become the UK’s leading multi channel contact centre and over the last few years we have made fantastic strides towards achieving this. This is entirely down to the relentless hard work from every single member of our team. \nOur clients have noticed that hard work too and every single one of them have expressed a desire to grow with us, which is great news for us as a business but even better news for the local jobs market. \nWe are now in a position to increase our current team of over 170 to around 270 which is an extra 100 jobs we can create in our region. It also means that there will most certainly be progression opportunities for our existing staff to take more senior roles within the business. \nThe new roles come on top of around 40 jobs created in March and growth in its sister company EC Business Solutions, which offers a business-to-business utilities brokerage service. 08:33 Youngest first-time buyers in North East \nThe North East has the youngest first-time buyers in the UK. \nAccording to Halifax, the average age of a first-time buyer in our region is 29 - this rises to 32 in London and the South East. Tim Ireland/PA Wire \nOutside of the North East, these are the areas with the youngest first-time buyers: Carlisle, 27; Torfaen, Wales, 27; Redditch, West Midlands, 28; Newark and Sherwood, East Midlands, 28; Doncaster, Yorkshire and the Humber, 28; Barnsley, Yorkshire and the Humber, 28; Waveney, East of England, 28; Blackburn with Darwen, North West, 28; Calderdale, Yorkshire and the Humber, 28; Broadland, East of England, 28. 08:22 Mixed performances for investment company \nHere’s the top news from the stock market this morning. \nInvestment group Tanfield has reported mixed performances from the two companies in which it holds a stake. \nThe Newcastle-based firm changed in 2013 from being a manufacturer of electric vehicles to an investment company with stakes in Snorkel Europe and Smith Electric Vehicles. \nIn half-year results announced today for the period ending June 30, Tanfield said Snorkel – in which it holds a 49% stake – had seen sales up 25%, giving it an investment value of £36.3m. \nBut Smith, which Tanfield has a 5.76% stake in, continues to have a nil value as it seeks new investment to keep it going. \nA statement from the company said: “As announced in the 2015 final results on 27 June 2016, the investment in Smith Electric was impaired to nil due to the uncertainty around its future and the level of funding it required.” 08:14 'Confidence in downward trend' \nFSB chairman Mike Cherry said: “There is no doubt that the political shock of the Brexit result has taken place at a time of weakening business confidence. For the first time in four years, confidence is in negative territory. Mike Cherry, chair of the Federation of Small Businesses \n“This persistent downward trend in UK business confidence reflects underlying issues that predate the Brexit decision.” \n“Small businesses are the key to driving economic growth and prosperity across the nations and regions of the UK. While small firms are proving resilient, we want to see some important decisions made by this new Government, and the new Chancellor is clearly going to be a major player.” 08:08 Kathryn Riddell Survey reveals worries of small businesses \nSmaller firms are increasingly worried about prospects for the UK economy even though they continue to recruit staff and enjoy greater access to finance, a new report shows. \nThe Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said confidence had continued to fall, with business owners feeling optimistic about the future being outnumbered by those who felt the opposite. \nA survey of over 1,000 FSB members revealed that just over half were aiming to grow in the next year and many were recruiting. \nBut the poll, the first by the FSB since the EU referendum , reflected a “fragile” outlook for the economy, with confidence falling into negative territory for the first time since 2012. 08:00 Kathryn Riddell Latest on the live blog \nGood morning and welcome to the Journal Business team’s morning live blog for Thursday, September 22. \nI’m Kathryn Riddell and I’m in the live blog chair this week to bring you regular updates on all the breaking business news from across the North East and beyond. \nThe business breakfast live blog covers the latest big stories from the region’s business community, as well as national news, FTSE updates and stock exchange announcements from the Journal region’s listed companies and national firms - anything and everything from the world of business basically. \nLet’s get started with Thursday’s business news.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-22T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-22T11:42:36.869+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
