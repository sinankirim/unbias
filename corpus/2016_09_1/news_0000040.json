Jane Barlow/PA Wire Owen Smith and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn \nIn practice, it would give Labour MPs more say over the way the party was run. \nThe NEC also considered proposals from Mr Watson to change the way in which the party elects its leader and put more power over the choice back into the hands of MPs and unions. \nBut Mr Corbyn was believed to be arguing that any changes to the party’s democratic structures should be part of a wider review to take place after the conference is over. \nAnd he was backed by Mr Lavery, who said any changes needed more consideration. \nMr Lavery said: “There should be more time for discussion. We are trying to rush this through too early. \nThe most important thing is the need for the arty to unite. There needs to be a commitment from all sides of the party. \n“Jeremy can’t really do any more than he’s doing in terms of holding the olive branch out to people who perhaps haven’t been supportive in the past.” \nMr Corbyn was willing to listen to advice from experienced Labour figures, Mr Lavery said. \n“Jeremy’s doing everything he possibly can to unite the party. He’s saying he wants the party to be united, he’s willing to learn from his mistakes and he wants to learn from senior politicians who have been in senior posts who can advise him on the best way forward.” MP Ian Lavery \nMr Lavery said Mr Corbyn would win the leadership election. \n“Jeremy will win this election probably by a bigger margin [than last time]. \n“People are going to have to come to terms with that. That’s what the members of the party want.” \nMeanwhile, in a letter to party members, Mr Smith said he would continue fighting for “a positive programme for a future Labour government” regardless of the outcome of the leadership election. \nHe said: “I entered this contest because I want to see a Labour government again. I want to see a radical, transformative government that can change our country for the better and bring an end to another generation of Tory rule.” \nMr Smith highlighted his proposals for a £200bn investment programme, an extra £60bn for our NHS and another Brexit referendum, adding: “These ideas will remain as relevant after this contest as they have been during this contest . . . whatever the outcome of this contest I will continue to make these arguments and do all I can to see us back in government.” Jane Barlow/PA Wire Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn Photo by Jane Barlow/PA Wire \nLabour Deputy Leader Tom Watson insisted Mr Corbyn could “very easily” be Labour’s next Prime Minister as long as the party unites concentrates on fighting the Tories, in an interview with BBC Radio 4. \nHe said: “I think Jeremy could easily be a Labour Prime Minister. \n“I think we’ve got change what we do, how we campaign . . . whoever wins that leadership we’ve got to swing in around that leader.” \nAnd he said he was “very concerned” by suggestions that some Labour MPs could be deselected. \nMr Watson said: “If energy is expended trying to undermine political opponents in your own party then obviously that’s time not spent characterising and attacking your opponents.” \nPredicting that Prime Minister Theresa May could call an early general election, he said: “Our sole focus after Saturday must be on taking on the Tory government.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-21T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-21T07:30:07.334+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
