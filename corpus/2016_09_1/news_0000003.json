A general election must also be held by 2020 at the latest, and Prime Minister Theresa May has indicated she is likely to wait until then before going to the polls. Stefan Rousseau/PA Wire MP Kevan Jones \nMr Jones told Mr Davis: “There is uncertainty, certainly in the North East of England, about the future of EU structural funds. Can he give a guarantee that, once we come out of the EU, those funds will be replaced by the Government?” \nMr Davis said: “I cannot speak for a future Government - that will be beyond the next election - but ... we will put in the Library the Chancellor’s letter underwriting many of the structural funds, research grants and common agricultural policy funds that are already in place.” \nNewcastle North MP Catherine McKinnell told the Government the North East needs answers on Brexit if the region is to work together “to make the best of this mess”. \nAnd she said the North East Combined Authority should be involved in the Brexit negotiations. \nThere are a series of “unanswered questions” about what Brexit means for the North East, she told MPs. Catherine McKinnell, MP for Newcastle upon Tyne North \nMrs McKinnell said: “Under what circumstances will North East firms be able to trade their goods and services to EU and non-EU countries in the future? \n“That knowledge is crucial to the only region in the UK that consistently exports more ​than it imports, with some 58% of North East exports currently going to the EU. \n“What will happen to EU nationals who have made a life for themselves in the North East, such as the 1,000 people who work in the NHS and the 600 university staff? Those are just two examples.” \nShe added: “To what extent will the North East be involved in the Brexit negotiations? Britain leaving the EU will clearly have a profound effect on my region and I share the determination of the North East Combined Authority that our voice is heard as loudly as anybody else’s throughout the process. \n“How will the Government be held accountable for any of this?” More on the EU Referendum", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-07T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-06T21:01:40.713+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
