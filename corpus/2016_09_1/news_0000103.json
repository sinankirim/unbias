Labour holds its conference in Liverpool next week, and the Conservatives meet in Birmingham the week after that. \nMr Farron will accuse politicians of being “complacent” about the NHS and highlight the Liberal Democrat review of health services, which the party calls a “new Beveridge Commission”. \nThe original Beveridge Report, published in 1942 by Liberal politician William Beveridge, helped lead to the creation of the modern welfare state. 2015 Getty Images Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron \nMr Farron will say: “We need to face the hard truth that the NHS needs more money – a lot more money – not just to stop it lurching from crisis to crisis but so that it can meet the needs and the challenges it will face in the years ahead. So that it can be the service we all need it to be for the long-term. To provide confidence in our health service for the next fifty years.” \nThe Lib Dem leader will say he was convinced that care services need improving after seeing how his grandfather was treated. \nHe will say: “In my Grandpa’s journey through Alzheimer’s, he had good care in the home he spent his last couple of years in. But when he first became ill after the death of my Grandma, the place he was put in was despicable. \n“Lonely, unclean, uncaring. It’s a few years back, but as I fought to get him out of that place and into somewhere better, it occurred to me that this was a standard experience for too many older people and their loved ones.” \nLocal health managers and council officials are currently working on plans for £22bn in NHS “efficiency savings”. \nGovernment Health Minister Philip Dunne told the House of Commons last week that the changes were “not about cuts” - but he also said that in some cases they involve “tough choices” and “reconfiguration of existing hospital services”. \nEngland was split into 44 regions, and each one was told to draw up a “Sustainability and Transformation Plan” setting out how money would be saved. \nThere’s a plan for Northumberland , Tyne and Wear and a separate plan for Durham, Darlington and Tees, Hambleton, Richmondshire and Whitby. Details of the planned changes are currently being kept under wraps. Ben Birchall/PA Wire Liberal Democrats leader Tim Farron \nMr Farron will also highlight his proposal for a second EU referendum , this time to ask voters whether or not they back the specific proposals for leaving the EU, once these become clear. \nAnd he will suggest some voters who backed Brexit did so out of a desire “to give the powerful a kicking”. \nMr Farron will say: “You see, if you base your political strategy on divide and rule, do not be surprised if the people you have divided decide to give you a kicking.” \nHe will add: “We see a London-centric, often Westminster-centric approach from politicians and the media. Treating the provinces as alien curiosities. \n“Those people in Preston and Sunderland and Wolverhampton see a divide between those who win and those who lose. When the country is booming, they don’t see the benefit. And when the economy is in decline they are the first to be hit.” \nThe speech will also include calls for the end of SAT tests in primary schools.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-20T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-20T08:03:01.260+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
