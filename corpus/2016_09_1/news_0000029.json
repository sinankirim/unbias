They must either admit it was a lie and apologise to their voters, or justify it and explain when it is coming.” \nIt comes as leading figures in the “leave” campaign launched a new group called “Change Britain” which is designed to ensure the Government accepts the verdict of June’s EU referendum and makes sure the UK leaves the European Union. \nChange Britain is backed by former Justice Secretary Michael Gove, former Foreign Secretary David Owen, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and former CBI chief Digby Jones among others. Stefan Rousseau/PA Wire Boris Johnson with the Vote Leave campaign bus \nAnd although not an official member, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has also backed the group, saying: “Brexit means Brexit and that means delivering on their instructions and restoring UK control over our laws, borders, money and trade.” \nDuring the referendum campaign the Leave campaign - which included many of the same people - said that the UK sends £350m a week to the EU, suggesting “let’s fund our NHS instead”. \nBut the Change Britain campaign doesn’t mention funding the NHS in its publicity material. \nMPs who supported staying in the European Union claim that many voters backed the “leave” campaign because they believed the NHS would get the money. \nThey said in an open letter: “Those who voted Leave, many of whom are in our constituencies, did so for a number of reasons. One was the promise that EU membership cost £350m a week and that this money should go to the NHS. This was the most prominent spending pledge of the Leave campaign - spelled out on their campaign bus so no one should be in any doubt - and constantly repeated.” \nThey added: “On behalf of the communities we represent, we will keep asking, where is the £350m for the NHS that was promised by the Leave campaign? Many will have voted to Leave based on this pledge. Those who made the pledge must now be held to account for the promise they made.” MP Catherine McKinnell \nThose signing the letter included Phil Wilson, Labour MP for Sedgefield; Tom Blenkinsop, Labour MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland; Bridget Phillipson, Labour MP for Houghton and Sunderland South; Jenny Chapman, Labour MP for Darlington; Julie Elliott, Labour MP for Sunderland Central; Anna Turley, Labour MP for Redcar, and Catherine McKinnell, Labour MP for Newcastle North. \nOthers who signed it included former Shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna. \nBut Mrs Stuart said everyone should accept the referendum result instead of trying to fight old battles. \nShe said: “Some on both sides seem attracted to fighting old ­battles, but the ­British people are impatient and expect us to roll up our sleeves and get down to work. \n“This isn’t a time for ­Leavers and Remainers — now is a time for Doers.” \nWriting in a newspaper she said: “Of course there are ­challenges ahead, but there is also a tremendous prize — a unique chance to change our country for the better, to make Britain stronger, fairer, better governed and more prosperous. \n“The challenge is not just ours. Our neighbours on the European continent need to find their own way forward in difficult circumstances for the eurozone. The stability of the ­European economy ­matters to us and it is important that they succeed.” \nAnd she said the referendum had forced politicians to acknowledge “that people in large sections of the UK have lost faith in political parties and the Westminster elite.” \nMrs Stuart said: “While millions in this country enjoy unprecedented prosperity and freedoms, many Leave voters felt their jobs under threat, their prospects and those of their children narrowing and the public services they rely on coming under growing strain. They still do. \n“They voted in the referendum for change and it is up to us in power to begin to make that happen.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-12T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-12T16:14:53.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
