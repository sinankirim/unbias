Read More Nissan's Wearside investments depend on Brexit talks, director says \nBut the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has admitted that the target was missed in Teesside. Instead, it said in a recent report that the target was “likely to be achieved before 2020.” A study into air quality in Tyneside reached the same conclusion. \nAnd a separate report by Public Health England has warned that in air pollution is responsible for an estimated 1,199 deaths each year in the North East, \nNow, a new report by MPs has warned that the problem is not being dealt with quickly enough. \nIn particular, they say that the Government is failing in its attempts to encourage people to start using low-pollution vehicles such as electric cars. \nAnd they say they are worried about the effect of leaving the EU, because at the moment it’s the European Union that imposes air pollution targets. Lauren Hurley/PA Wire EAC chair Mary Creagh \nMP Mary Creagh, chair of the Commons Environmental Audit Committee, said: “We need 9% of all new cars to be ultra-low emission vehicles by 2020 if we’re going to meet our climate change targets at the lowest cost to the public. \n“But the Department’s forecasts show it will get only around half way to this target.” \nAnd she called on the Government to encourage automotive manufacturers to invest in the UK. \nNissan Chairman and CEO Carlos Ghosn warned in August that decisions about future investment at the Sunderland plant would depend on the outcome of the UK’s negotiations about leaving the EU. \nMs Creagh said: “Ministers should also think about changes to vehicle taxation, including company cars, to make electric vehicles more attractive. \n“The Government needs to give manufacturers – such as Nissan, Honda, LTI, and Toyota - a reason to choose their UK car factories – in places like Sunderland, Swindon, Coventry, and Derby - to manufacture the next generation of low emission vehicles. This would encourage Nissan to manufacture the next generation of their electric car, the Leaf, in Sunderland, from 2018.” \nAnd she warned: “With the vote to leave the EU, there’s a material risk to our air quality targets. At the very least, the Government should commit to keeping existing European air quality standards.” Lewis Whyld/PA Wire A car exhaust \nMPs said regions where air pollution breaches legal air quality limits include Coventry and Bedworth; The Potteries; the West Midlands urban area, including Birmingham and the Black Country, and the wider West Midlands region. \nPublic Health England has previously revealed that air pollution is estimated to cause 1,199 excess deaths a year in the North East. \nThe pollution figures refer to levels of nitrogen dioxide in the air. This is a gas released when fuels are burned, including petrol or diesel in a car engine, and it can affect the way lungs work over long periods of time.

The EU target states that there should never be more than 200 micrograms of the gas per cubic metre of air even in the worst conditions. \nA government spokesman said: “The Government is firmly committed to improving the UK’s air quality and cutting harmful emissions. That’s why we have committed more than £2 billion to greener transport schemes since 2011 and set out a national plan to tackle pollution in our towns and cities. \n“We have some of the safest roads in the world and are committed to making sure that record continues.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-02T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-02T17:55:18.728+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
