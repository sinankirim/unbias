Who is to say that UKIP cannot do the same in England? 18:00, 28 Sep 2016 North East UKIP MEP Jonathan Arnott on the realignment that is on the cards in politics as Labour descends into madness Share Get daily news by email Jonathan Arnott, UKIP MEP for the North East \nUKIP has a new leader ; the Labour Party has simply recycled an old one. Labour’s 1983 Manifesto probably now has a challenger for the title of the ‘longest suicide note in history’. It’s telling that almost half of all Labour voters, according to a recent poll, think that the Labour Party will never again form a government. \nIf new UKIP Leader Diane James gets it right, then there’s a real opportunity for UKIP in the North of England to challenge Labour. We’ve seen a political realignment in Scotland where the Labour Party was replaced by the SNP; who is to say that there can’t be a similar realignment of the political magnetic poles here and that UKIP won’t be the party to replace Labour? I imagine that Conservatives and Liberal Democrats will be celebrating the result of Labour’s election too. \nAlbert Einstein once said that the definition of madness is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. The Labour Party is down in the opinion polls, and heading for a landslide defeat at the next General Election if it does nothing new. It’s harassed by the SNP in Scotland, UKIP in the North and in Wales, by the Conservatives in the South and the Liberal Democrats are scrambling around like vultures over the pickings of a carcass. \nThe Labour Party seems to be doubling down on calling its opponents racist rather than actually engaging with real issues which affect them. Hillary Clinton is making the same mistake in America at the moment; rather than deal with the odious Trump directly, she chose to insult his supporters as ‘a basket of deplorables’. Trump went up in the polls. \nDiane Abbott claimed that those who want controlled immigration rather than ‘free movement’ (read: unrestricted borders) don’t like foreign-looking people on the streets. \nWhat a completely unnecessary insult to working-class people who voted to leave the European Union. Does she really think this will really endear Labour to their own supporters who voted Leave? \nNeither is it a good look when a shadow government minister reportedly has to be told not to give a Communist salute to the Red Flag at the Labour Conference. I believe Stalinist ideology should be every bit as unacceptable as Hitler’s; both killed millions – tens of millions – of innocents. But then, a Shadow Chancellor who brought Chairman Mao’s Little Red Book into the House of Commons clearly has a thing or two to learn about the unacceptable nature of extremist dictatorships. \nAt a Labour Party fringe event, Hope Not Hate told Labour supporters that they need to engage with racists who are voting for UKIP. Well, I’ll venture to suggest that a good start would be actually listening to their concerns rather than accuse them of racism. \nI’m a UKIP MEP. I didn’t agree with some of what happened in the referendum campaign (though remember Remain’s threats of World War Three and the end of Western political civilisation were a hell of a lot worse, and I’ve not heard any of them apologising), and I won’t be defending that awful poster. \nI believe in the unity of our nation, and that means that we all – of whatever race, ethnicity or background – need to come together to make Brexit work. In that spirit I have praised my Labour MEP colleagues Paul Brannen and Jude Kirton-Darling, who at least are doing what they should be: trying to ensure that we get the best possible deal for working people, for farmers, and so on. \nIt’s a much better approach than that being taken by a Labour Party nationally which should take the plank out of its own eye before dealing with the speck in someone else’s. I refer of course to the current antisemitism storm within the Labour Party, which frankly I’m astonished could be countenanced by any political party in the 21st century. \nThen new Labour peer Shami Chakrabarti issued a plea to Jewish Labour members not to leave. One good way of achieving that would be to stop sweeping antisemitism under the carpet. ”Don’t leave me here in a room with Essex Man”, she begged, in a move reminiscent of Emily Thornberry’s mocking of white van man. \nAs for the Labour members crying ‘racism’ more often than a little boy might cry ‘wolf’, I’ll challenge anyone in Labour to point to anything that I’ve ever said that’s racist. No? Didn’t think so. \nJonathan Arnott is UKIP MEP for the North East", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-29T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-28T21:34:40.061+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
