The morning rush hour traffic builds up on St James Boulevard \nAnd a consultation carried out by the mayor’s officer found that the charge was popular. It found eight out of ten Londoners wanted the charge introduced a year earlier, in 2019 - while seven out of ten believed it should be expanded to cover a wider area. \nBut other major towns and cities across the country have also struggled to cut air pollution, which experts say leads to hundreds of early deaths. \nEarlier this month a House of Commons report named 38 out of 43 areas across the UK that are in breach of legal air pollution limits, including both the Teesside Urban Area and Tyneside. \nA motion which Liberal Democrats are expected to approve at their conference in Brighton calls for the Government to give councils across the country the ability to introduce schemes similar to the one operating in London. \nIt warns: “Current levels of road congestion are at crisis point and local authorities need greater powers to deal with traffic offences and to create Ultra Low Emission Zones.” \nThe European Union set limits for the level of air pollution which were supposed to be met by 2010. \nBut the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has admitted that the target was missed in Teesside. Instead, it said in a recent report that the target was “likely to be achieved before 2020.” A study into air quality in Tyneside reached the same conclusion. \nAnd a separate report by Public Health England has warned that air pollution is responsible for an estimated 1,199 deaths each year in the North East. \nThe Commons Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee also said councils should have more powers to bring in road pricing in a report earlier this year. \nSome critics of congestion charging would argue that it is more appropriate to London than elsewhere because the capital has a more comprehensive public transport network than other parts of the country. matthew.walker@nissan-nmuk.co.uk Colin Lawther, Senior Vice President Manufacturing, purchasing and Supply Chain Management next to the 100% electric Nissan Leaf \nOther proposals in the Liberal Democrat document include measures to encourage more people to buy ultra-low pollution vehicles, which could provide a boost to manufacturers such as Nissan , in Sunderland, which have led the way in producing electric cars. \nThe Nissan Leaf is the world’s best-selling electric car and is already a huge success. Earlier this year the Sunderland plant reached a significant milestone, building its 50,000th Leaf electric car. \nLiberal Democrats say there should be more charging points for electric cars, making them more attractive to motorists. \nThe Liberal Democrat motion also calls for “smart ticketing” schemes to be rolled out across public transport networks across the country to provide faster, cheaper and improved integrated transportation options across all regions. \nSmart ticketing already operates in London, where a single “Oyster” card can be used on bus, underground, rail and ferry services. \nThe North East is more advanced than other regions in developing a similar scheme, and the ‘Pop’ Pay As You Go card can be used on the Metro , almost all buses and the Shields Ferry, although not rail services. Pop card launch at Haymarket metro with Transport minister Andrew Jones \nLib Dems are calling for smart travel cards to cover all all forms of public transport and say it should be expanded through the Bus Services Bill, currently going through the House of Lords. \nLiberal Democrat Transport spokesperson Baroness Jenny Randerson said: “Smart tickets have revolutionised passenger journeys in the capital. It is about time this technology was used to improve public transport across the UK. \n“Introducing smart cards will mean easier transfers, cheaper fares and simpler journeys for millions of passengers in major cities like Newcastle or Birmingham. \n“This must form part of a broader government strategy to invest in public transport and reduce congestion on our roads.” \nAnd the transport motion calls for more investment in cycling and walking facilities, as well as measures to make rail operators listen to passengers - including bigger penalties if they fail to provide a good service. \nLib Dems say their party is making gains following last year’s general election which saw it reduced to just eight seats in the House of Commons, and has won a series of local council by-elections. \nBut there was evidence of a split in the party after a former minister said plans to campaign for a second EU referendum were “seriously disrespectful and utterly counterproductive”. Pop card launch at Haymarket Metro with Transport minister Andrew Jones and Newcastle City Council leader Nick Forbes \nFormer business secretary Sir Vince Cable has come out strongly against his party’s bid to reject the June 23 vote. \nLeader Tim Farron, backed by his predecessors Nick Clegg and Lord Campbell, said he will campaign for the public to be given a vote on the final Brexit deal - including an option to remain in the EU. \nSpeaking at a fringe event on the third day of the conference, Sir Vince said: “There are people in the party who don’t accept the outcome, who feel incredibly angry and feel it’s reversible, that somehow we can undo it. \n“The public have voted and I do think it’s seriously disrespectful and politically utterly counterproductive to say ‘sorry guys, you’ve got it wrong, we’re going to try again’, I don’t think we can do that. \n“That’s a personal view, and a lot of people won’t share that view.” \nJulie Pörksen, Lib Dem Parliamentary Spokesperson for the Berwick-Upon-Tweed Constituency, said: “During these uncertain times for Britain post-Brexit, it has been important that the Lib Dem Conference has a focus on making the future fairer for everyone, from small businesses to refugee children. \n“Committing to investing in Britain, from much needed housing to schools and the NHS provides a strong direction for the future well-being of our country. \n“I am particularly pleased by Norman Lamb’s announcement that we are investigating innovative ways to secure and increase support for the NHS, on the doorstep I have had many conversations with residents from Rothbury to Newcastle who really value our local NHS and would be pleased to support greater funds to ensure a quality service is maintained in local areas. \n“It is critical that new thinking is brought in to address the future of our NHS, under threat in areas such as the Coquet Valley, and I am pleased the Lib Dems are leading the way.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-20T04:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-19T23:25:49.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
