Like-for-like sales, which exclude income from newly opened stores, rose by 2.5 per cent and full-year profits came in at £128.9 million, a rise of 6.2 per cent compared to the same time last year. \nChief executive John Browett said: \"The business has performed well over the year. Shoppers tell us that they genuinely appreciate the unrivalled depth and value of the Dunelm homewares offer. This has meant we have further cemented our leading position through market share gains, driving sales and profits growth, and increasing returns to shareholders, including a 16.7% increase in total ordinary dividends and a special distribution of 31.5p per share. \n\"My first year as chief executive has been extremely busy and we're working hard on initiatives across the business. Not least, we are investing in our stores to make them much easier to shop, whilst making sure our vast range of product maintains the value for money proposition which lies at the very heart of the Dunelm offer. \n\"We remain particularly focused on extending the Dunelm offer to more customers and have opened six new superstores in the year. This will be ramped up in the current year with nine planned openings, three of which are in the London area where we are excited by the clear opportunity for growth. \n\"We continue to outperform the homewares market, and despite potential challenges to the economy over the coming months and the dampening effect on footfall of recent hot weather, we believe that Dunelm's competitive position can come into its own, and are confident of continuing to deliver our growth ambitions.\" \nShares in Dunelm, which have been steadily rising after an initial post-Brexit shock, were changing hands for 915.5p in early trading.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-14T16:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-14T13:38:00.331+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
