We are proud to be consistently ranked as a world top 100 university. \n“Overall Durham is performing extremely well globally and is placed as the 12th highest UK university out of 91 UK universities in total in the global list of almost a thousand. \n“In addition, in national league tables we are also consistently ranked as one of the top universities in the UK and top in North East England. \n“Our strategy is to build on our position and make sure we are amongst the best in world for research, education and the wider student experience.” Newcastle University \nProfessor Chris Brink, Vice Chancellor of Newcastle University , welcomed the rating boost. \nHe added: “It is particularly encouraging that this latest ranking recognises Newcastle’s strengths in research citations and also in our International Outlook which assesses the global nature of our staff and student community and the links we have with global partners.” \nThe University of Oxford was named the best in the world, with two other UK institutions — Cambridge and Imperial College London — making the top ten. \nWith 88 universities in the top 800, up from 78 last year, the UK is second only to the US for the number institutions in the world’s best 800. \nBut as the rankings were released, higher education experts warned that the vote to leave the European Union could pose a “big threat” to higher education in the UK, as it may make it more difficult for academics from working with colleagues on the continent. \nAnd there are fears Brexit might also discourage overseas students from applying to British universities. \nPhil Baty, editor of the THE world university rankings, said: “The UK must ensure that it limits the damage to academics, students, universities and science during its Brexit negotiations to ensure that the UK remains one of the world leaders in higher education.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-22T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-22T07:17:22.699+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
