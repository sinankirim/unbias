Stuart Birkett. \nWe're delighted to formally launch the Journal & Gazette North East Business Awards 2017, the premier business event in our region. \nWe are living in interesting times, and recent events make the job of forecasting more challenging than ever. Brexit, Devolution, Combined Local Authorities, the Northern Powerhouse, political leadership the list goes on. \nAs you know, The Journal and Gazette have at their very core the absolute commitment to championing our business community, its successes, great leaders, and ambitions. You, the wealth creators, are the most important community in the region, and we’re here to articulate your agenda for growth, your ambitions, needs and concerns. \nPut simply, The Journal and The Gazette ensure the voice of North East business is heard across the region, nationally, and specifically in government. Together, our partnership with yourselves makes a positive difference for the region- local business supported by local media. \nWe’re on your side. We’re not here just to report events, but to influence outcomes – a growing North East economy, healthier, wealthier and underpinned by a skilled workforce. \nA notable example of The Journal and Gazette being in partnership with North East business is the Let’s Grow campaign, which has already created or safeguarded more than 4,000 jobs in the region and, working with our friends at BE Group and UNW, we are now administering a second tranche of a further £30m of RGF funding to carry on the excellent work. Both brands continue to address the growing skills gap and the ongoing need for a robust apprenticeships programme throughout the region. \nWe showcase businesses large and small – from our Top 200 Companies through to start ups, and throughout we provide regional business leaders with a platform to discuss and form our future policies and priorities through a series of themed business breakfasts. This year we’ve held European and Northern Powerhouse breakfast events. \nAs always we’re eager to publish business success stories, and these awards are a critically important part of that. They enable us to showcase the region and to raise the profile of the North East nationally and globally as a great place to do business. You don’t have to look too far for examples of this excellence, of course. Bob Cuffe Northern Powerhouse Breakfast 2016 held at Hardwick Hall \nThe business platforms of The Journal and The Gazette are full of such positive stories on a daily basis both online and in print - and we want more. Make sure you let us know your good news! The North East Business Awards are the biggest and best of their kind in the UK with almost 2,000 people attending the four events earlier this year. \nThis is the 17th year of the current format, with sub-regional events for Teesside, Durham, Sunderland & South Tyneside, and Tyneside & Northumberland culminating in the regional final which takes place on April 27, 2017, at Hardwick Hall, Sedgefield. \nBut we are not standing still and continue to listen to your feedback as to how we can keep the awards fresh, relevant and engaging. On this theme, in recent years we’ve added new categories – Let’s Grow, and Digital & Social Media to the list of honours, and we continue to look at innovative changes to the format of the events themselves. \nWe’d like to pay special tribute to our headline sponsor, the North East England Chamber of Commerce who for 200 years have championed the business community, and thank them for their longstanding support to these awards. \nTo succeed in our shared ambitions for, and belief in our region, we need you, the businesses of the region to get actively engaged. \nWe’re looking for as many nominations as possible to ensure the competition remains as truly representative of what is happening in our business community as ever. Entries last year were more than 20% up on the previous levels – but we want more. We want to hear of and from companies who have achieved and are achieving great things during 2016. \nEvery year we are delighted by the support the awards receive both from our sponsors and from companies taking part. This says a huge amount about the attitude, talent, spirit and enterprise we have here in the North East. Please get involved. There are a number of ways that you can do this – by entering the awards, by telling us about companies you know of or have worked with that you believe should enter, by becoming a sponsor, by attending the events and/or any combination of the above. \nStuart Birkett, Managing Director, ncjmedia, and Bob Cuffe, Regional Managing Director, Trinity Mirror North East.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-07T17:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-07T13:00:34.985+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
