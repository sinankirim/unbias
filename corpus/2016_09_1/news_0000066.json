The proposed changes explained 15:30, 12 Sep 2016 By Charles White New rules being considered by the European Commission could see Brits having to fork out for visas on top of regular holiday costs Shares Get daily news by email Alex Wong/Getty Images British biometric European Union passport with an embedded with a microchip \nNew rules could see a visa charge introduced for Brits travelling to Europe . \nTop Tories have been forced to admit that Brexit may cause holidaymakers visiting the continent a real headache. \nIn the build up to June’s EU Referendum , voters were told they wouldn’t need a visa to visit Europe - but now the EU says they might. \nAccording to the Office for National Statistics, British residents made more than 30 million holiday trips to EU countries last year, with Spain (13 million visits) and France (8.8 million visits) the most popular destinations. \nSo how much will these new plans cost you and will it ever happen? Here is what we know so far. What are the plans? \nCurrently you can get to Europe and you only need to show your passport. \nHowever, the European Commission is considering a visa system similar to the ESTA travel permits we need to visit America. \nThat would mean Brits would fill in an online form to visit our neighbouring countries. What do these plans actually mean? Joe Raedle/Getty Images Leonel Cordova (L) and Noris Cordova speak to a CBP officer as they try to use their new mobile app at an entry point as the program is unveiled for international travellers arriving at Miami International Airport \nThe ESTA - or the Electronic System for Travel Authorisation - is a requirement that could be a model for any European travel. \nBrits have a special status for getting into the US and so only need to fill in the ESTA form before travel. \nCosting $14, it is required for entering the country. But some third-party agents can charge more to fill in the online forms. \nESTAs can be refused by the US and travellers have to apply for an actual visa. \nIt is not known if Brits would face the same situation to visit Europe. What is the Government doing about this? \nSome Conservative MPs have admitted that this system could happen. \nHome Secretary, Amber Rudd, said on the Andrew Marr show: “It is a reminder that this a two-way negotiation. \n“The EU and the commissioner may be considering issues, alternatives, they’ll be considering their negotiation with us. Just as we’re considering it with them. \nShe added that people would be “surprised” if they had to get a visa to go to France. However, Ms Rudd made a point of not ruling out this possibility. \nThe Home Secretary said that all options had to be on the table when negotiating. Will I need a visa to go see family? AP Photo/Manu Fernandez People sunbathe on a beach in Barcelona, Spain, Sunday \nYes. The same goes for other leisure or business trips. That’s the plan at least. \nIf the European Commission does enact an ESTA system, then any travel into EU countries would require you to fill in an online form before travel. When could this happen? \nThis is part of the negotiations to end our relationship with the European Union. \nArticle 50, which is the official mechanism to leave the EU, has not yet been triggered but could be by the end of the year. \nThat would mean plans like this could affect summer holidays in two years time. And what about cost? \nUnder current rules, a visa for non-EU residents who wish to visit the Schengen zone costs £50. It is thought a similar cost could be implemented for British tourists. \nThe Schengen zone is a passport-free area made up of 26 European countries.
