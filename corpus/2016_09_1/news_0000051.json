Views from the Tyne Cruise, Port of Tyne \nIt follows the launch of a report by think tank IPPR North in June, which highlighted the dominance of southern ports and the problems this creates in transporting imports and exports across the UK. \nAt the moment, 60% of freight destined for the North is delivered to southern ports - leading to unnecessary motorway traffic, delays, pollution and inefficiency. \nBut IPPR North and the new association says that the North can act as a genuine gateway to the world, connecting Atlantic shipping in Liverpool in the west to the east’s links with the Continent.

The Journal and Ward Hadaway's 2015 Fastest 50 Business Awards held at the Baltic, Gateshead. \n“For just £100m, the Government could open-up east-west port connections and create a genuine gateway to a global North. \n“This is exactly the kind of ‘shovel-ready’ project HM Treasury looks to be eyeing-up ahead of the Autumn Statement.” \nThe Port of Tyne, which manages the Tyne port, is a statutory body governed by legislation and controlled by an independent board. It has no shareholders, and any profit is invested into the organisation and its work. \nIt’s responsible for a 19-mile stretch of the River Tyne, and three miles of sea outside of the piers. \nThe port’s turnover in 2015 was £58.8m. It handled five million tonnes of cargo in the same year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-14T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-13T21:12:27.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
