Given that last year’s result was in itself a record for our group then to increase this by a further 66% has exceeded reasonable expectations. \n“The favourable trends for athletic inspired footwear and apparel in Europe have continued into this year. We are very much at the centre of this market with our success being a positive consequence of the investments we have made over a number of years to develop the JD retail concept. \n“Notwithstanding the demanding comparatives going forward following the strong revenue growth in the previous three years, the positive nature of trading in the second half to date is encouraging.” 08:20 Daniel Milligan \nThe FTSE-100 index opened at 6700.90. \nThe pound at 8am was 1.3317 dollars compared to 1.3312 dollars at the previous close. \nThe euro at 8am was 0.8431 pounds compared to 0.8434 pounds at the previous close. 08:15 Daniel Milligan Good morning \nGood morning and welcome to the Journal Business team’s morning live blog for Monday, September 12. \nI’m Dan Milligan and I’m in the live blog chair this week to bring you regular updates on all the breaking business news from across the North East and beyond. \nThe business breakfast live blog covers the latest big stories from the region’s business community, as well as national news, FTSE updates and stock exchange announcements from the Journal region’s listed companies and national firms - anything and everything from the world of business basically. \nI’ll also remind you of some of our latest regional stories in case you missed them. \nIf you’d like to contribute tweet at @jnlbusiness to share your opinions, drop me a line at coreena.ford@ncjmedia.co.uk or tweet me here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-13T15:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-13T10:51:38.149+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
