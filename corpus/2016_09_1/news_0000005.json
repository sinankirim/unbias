The factory now produces more than 500,000 vehicles a year and exports to more than 130 different countries. \n“The impact has been massive - not just locally but nationally,” said MD Kevin Fitzpatrick, one of 115 members of staff who have been at the plant for its entire history (starting as supervisor of its paint shop). PA Wire An aerial view of cars at Nissan \n“There wasn’t a supply base in the North East when we started, but through the local contract requirement with the Government, we started getting parts in Europe and the UK and set the local supply base up. \n“At first that was pretty poor in terms of meeting delivery and quality standards, but Nissan worked by itself and through a Government agency to train the supply base in modern manufacturing.” \nWithout the company’s lead, Mr Fitzpatrick said, it was unlikely UK manufacturing would be as competitive as it now. \n“We opened the door for the likes of Toyota and Honda to come here,” he said. “I don’t know if they would have done otherwise.” \nIn the factory’s early days, he said, there was a “cynical view” in some quarters that the company would likely disappear from the North East within five years. \nAt the same time, it was “very exciting” for the new recruits, many of whom were eager to leave traditional industries behind them and embrace the “great opportunities to learn” that Nissan represented. \nOne of the of biggest changes to take place over the years, he added, has been the increased use of robotics, with the plant now 95% automated. \nAs far as output is concerned, a Qashqai can built in 8.5 hours, compared to 22 hours for the Bluebird, the first car to come from the site, \nNMUK Sunderland has also become a leader in pioneering green technology, producing the Nissan Leaf, and committing to a £26.5m investment to produce the future generation of electric vehicle batteries. \nThe site is likewise embracing the latest developments in autonomous driving technology, which will next year make its way into the Qashqai. \nAs Mr Fitzpatrick pointed out, however, it hasn’t always been plain sailing; in the late ‘90s, for example, poor sales of models such as the Primera caused significant upheaval, leading to the signing of the Renault-Nissan Alliance. \n“We knew we were good, but we had to demonstrate to Renault that we were good,” he said. \n“We spent a lot of time doing that and on improving ourselves, which led to a step-change in our competitiveness.” \nA decade on, then, there was the economic crash to contend with. \n“We were still doing what we normally do, then pretty much overnight, people stopped buying cars,” Mr Fitzpatrick said. \n“It was pretty scary and we didn’t know how to combat it. There had been uncertainty before, but we had never had that kind of crisis.” \nIn the end, around 800 employees were lost their jobs. Aerial view of Nissan in 1986 \nNissan, however, bounced back swiftly and many were re-hired, benefiting from the “turning point” that was the success of the Qashqai and the Juke. \nToday, the company continues to place significant emphasis on its skilled workforce, offering career development programmes, graduate schemes, initiatives with schools and, of course, apprenticeships. \n“I’ve always thought apprenticeships were a good way of developing people within manufacturing and engineering,” Mr Fitzpatrick said. \n“When I was 16, I couldn’t face another two years in the classroom; I wanted to learn and gain qualifications, but I also wanted to get out and make money. It’s the same for lots of people, but I think many are denied that opportunity.” \nAs it looks to the future, Nissan will be paying close attention to discussions surrounding Brexit. \nMr Fitzpatrick would not be drawn on the implications of the EU referendum vote on the Sunderland site, though comments from Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe earlier this week highlighted concerns among Japanese companies about Brexit. \nThe company’s global CEO Carlos Ghosn had called for a Remain vote before June’s referendum, and has made it clear since then that the company hopes the UK will retain its ability to export easily into the European Union. 30 years of Nissan \nNissan announces that the plant will be located in Sunderland. \nGround breaking ceremony takes place. \nA ceremony is held to lay the foundation stone.
