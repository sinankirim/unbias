Labour says when the announcement is made it will be possible to calculate how much the UK - and very region - would have received if we were still EU members. \nIn her speech to the Labour Party Conference in Liverpool , Ms Thornberry is expected to say: “For the period 2014 to 2020, the UK was allocated €10.8 billion in structural funding for our most deprived regions and communities. The Tories have given an undertaking hedged in conditions that funding up to 2020 will be protected. \n“For the period after, they have said nothing. \n“That is not good enough. Without long-term certainty over funding, our most deprived regions and communities cannot plan ahead. They cannot attract other investment. They cannot make progress. \n“So thanks to John McDonnell, Labour’s Shadow Chancellor , we can guarantee that a future Labour government will make up any shortfall in structural funding into the 2020s and beyond. And the same will go for the funding of peace and reconciliation projects in Northern Ireland.” \nLabour’s commitment comes as the party publishes a new document entitled ‘Protecting rights and investment for our communities’, which analyses all the legal rights and funding programmes which currently derive from Britain’s membership of the EU, and says Labour will fight to stop these being scrapped by the Tory Government after Brexit. \nIn the section on regional funding, the document says: “It could not be clearer that – of all the rights and investment protected by Britain’s membership of the EU – one of the most significant, regional funding, is also one of the most directly and imminently under threat from the Tory Government. \n“The Labour Party therefore commits that – as a central plank of our future manifesto and budget plans – we will establish a properly managed domestic fund for less prosperous regions currently in receipt of EU structural funds, and we will ensure that level of funding is protected in full, into the 2020s and beyond. \n“Funding this commitment will be our top priority for allocating the estimated net savings deriving from Britain’s withdrawal from the EU. Those communities who stand to lose out most from Brexit must be looked after first.” \nThe money will come from savings the UK will make on contributions to the EU budget which it will no longer have to pay. \nSpeaking to the Chronicle, Ms Thornberry said that Labour would accept the result of the June referendum in which voters backed Brexit \nShe said: “We’ve got our instructions. We are democrats.” \nBut she also raised the possibility that voters could demand another referendum. \n“Given the promises that were made to people who voted for Brexit, and given that they are so contradictory and that they can’t fulfil all those promises, there may come a time when people who voted for Brexit, when they see that it doesn’t deliver everything that they want, will be demanding a referendum. Who knows.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-26T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-26T10:13:58.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
