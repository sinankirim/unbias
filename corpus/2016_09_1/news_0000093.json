A Northumbria University project that helped its graduates start their own businesses; Work at Sunderland University to improve the performance of small and medium-sized businesses by providing skilled graduates to do internships. Lucy Winskell OBE is pro vice-chancellor for business and engagement with Northumbria University \nLucy Winskell, pro vice-chancellor for business and law at Northumbria University , said: “This report shows the far reaching contribution business schools like Newcastle Business School at Northumbria University make to the performance of small and medium firms, major multinationals and key parts of the public sector. \n“Northumbria University has a proven track record in working with commercial partners, where the university has added real value to these companies. Through excellent research, teaching and innovation we make a powerful contribution to economic development and regeneration, locally, nationally and globally. \n“Naturally we can prepare for if and when the availability of funding is less certain. But we will continue to increase the number of quality collaborations and build on existing partnerships such as those with Unilever, Nike, IBM, Nissan and Procter & Gamble from a real position of strength as the UK’s Business School of the Year.” \nThe report calls on the Government to replace the European funds that will be lost to business schools after Brexit. \nIt also highlights the value of collaboration between academics and businesses to improve the economy.
