We are a powerhouse of innovation and excel in so many areas of business, from subsea to manufacturing. These awards give us all a chance to reward our industry leaders. \nLast year, we took winners of the NEBA to the national British Chambers of Commerce final and, if you ever need to know how our region rates against stiff competition, remember that Hodgson Sayers won the national Business of the Year award. They say the profile-raising honour has been extremely beneficial to their business. \nWe also had six other successes that evening in London, after competing with 70 firms from around the UK. Businesses can read the roll call of achievements here and perhaps imagine their own name on this list in 2017. \nPeople Development Award and UK Business of the Year 2015 – Hodgson Sayers. \nBusiness in the Community Award – Gus Robinson Developments. \nHigh Growth Business of the Year – PJA Distribution. \nExporting Business of the Year – Advanced Industrial Solutions (AIS). \nBusiness & Education Partnership – Gateshead College (finalist). \nSmall Business of the Year – Tomlinson Hall (finalist). \nBut first you need to enter these regional awards, which we are delighted to support. We may have many uncertainties in our national economy at present, with Brexit in particular, but our last Quarterly Economic Survey, which although taken before the referendum, showed signs of steady growth. \nThe North East business community will succeed and build on our proud industrial and pioneering heritage with cutting-edge businesses and global contracts. \nTogether, we grow stronger. These award winners will prove it. \nJames Ramsbotham, chief executive, North East England Chamber of Commerce", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-07T17:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-07T13:00:48.246+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
