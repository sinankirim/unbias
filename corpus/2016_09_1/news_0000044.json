Cameron resigned, markets went into meltdown and political instability reigned as people tried to understand the impact of Britain’s EU exit – or Brexit – on their jobs, communities and lives. \nAlready it has had an effect on the business community in the North East, which has previously benefited from millions of pounds of European funding. \nAccording to the latest Lloyds Bank Regional Purchasing Managers Index, the region experienced the sharpest decline in business activity for four years in July as the referendum result increased cost pressures and sparked a slowdown in orders. \nA major factor in the reduced activity was the dip in incoming orders, which fell at the fastest pace in almost seven-and-a-half years and caused companies to scale back and shed jobs. \nEven price cuts failed to stimulate demand during the period, with the North East seeing the quickest decline in new incoming business of all UK regions. \nA separate survey by manufacturers’ organisation EEF painted an equally gloomy picture, claiming that Brexit would lead to lower levels of investment in the sector with manufacturing firms shunning bank funding in favour of self-financing projects themselves. \nLiz Mayes, EEF regional director for the North East, said: “These findings echo what we hear in the North East. While on the whole, our members in this region do maintain strong relationships with their banks, we also know that access to long-term finance is key. \n“Many local manufacturers, particularly those that are internationally owned, will often seek this from their parent company rather than banks and this could mean that important investment plans are shelved if the internal funding is not available.” \nOthers, however, are more upbeat. Sunderland-based ScS, one of the UK’s largest retailers of upholstered furniture and floorings, said sales were still buoyant in the wake of the Brexit vote. Liz Mayes \nMeanwhile John Elliott, chairman of water cooler maker Ebac and a fervent anti-EU campaigner, said Brexit should be used as a catalyst to get behind UK manufacturing. \nHe said: “Tariffs are a double-edged sword and because we import more from the EU than we export to it, the effect of tariffs will favour UK manufacturers over EU manufacturers. \n“The tariffs that are added to EU-made goods will mean that the UK consumer will have to pay more but the effect on the overall economy is neutralised because the tariffs are paid to the UK exchequer. This revenue could be used to reduce VAT, for example. The effect of this tariff will make UK manufactured goods more attractive and should help to kick- start the growth of UK manufacturing.” \nIn the North East there appears to be a steely determination among business owners to brave whatever conditions the post-Brexit era throws at them. \nDean Benson, MD of Stockton e-commerce specialist Visualsoft, said businesses should continue to improve the local skills base regardless of Britain’s status within Europe. In our industry there’s no shortage of people, there’s just a shortage of skills in the area,” he said. \n“Staying in the EU won’t fix it, we have to take control of our own destiny. I’m of the opinion that in chaos lies opportunity. We need to continue to work with education providers to develop skills and bring on the next generation of talent. \n“There has been no impact of Brexit on our business. We’re fortunate that we’re operating in a fast-moving tech market where things carry on regardless of politics. People use Brexit as a bit of an excuse. I’ve never been big into politics and I think there’s too much talking and not enough action.” Read More EU Referendum: Report reveals why the North East backed Brexit \nOthers are less optimistic. Dr Nick Dalton, senior lecturer in computing at Northumbria University and a researcher in human-computer interaction, said the North East could lose out in the post-Brexit era under a “UK-only research funding model”. He said: “UK science was a big beneficiary of European funding. Between 2007 and 2013 the UK received €8.8bn (£7.5bn) in EU research money, second only behind Germany. Most UK funding goes to London, Oxford and Cambridge so places like the North East will suffer greatly.” \nDr Dalton believes Brexit could threaten the North East’s status as a leading light in the field of computer technology. He said: “The Newcastle is the number one city in the UK and third worldwide in terms of research on human-computer interaction – how to design computers to work with people. The issue is that things change so quickly in our industry. Computing can change a huge amount in the two or three years it will take to negotiate Brexit. \n“The Apple Watch is a year old, the smart phone is seven years old, the internet is 17 years old and computers will be about four times faster or cheaper by the time the uncertainty over Brexit is negotiated. Imagine what it would be like if cars could go from 70mph to 280mph by the time the decision about the people you work with is made. \n“People come to the NE because we have strong research-led expertise. They want to learn from the best and learn from the innovators in a field. The decline in EU funding means that research is going struggle and so teaching – and skills – has a new struggle.” \nNorthumbria University currently works with several overseas partners on an exciting mix of research projects. Dr Dalton teamed up with a German-based research partner to explore how people interact with ambient advertising, where adverts are placed in unusual locations to generate a response from potential customers. John Elliott \n“Post-Brexit it’s going to be more difficult to do projects like this,” he said. “Whilst we have the skills in this region, the UK is not being invited to early-stage discussions on research projects so we’re already seeing the impact of Brexit. \n“It’s the uncertainty that’s the problem. We [Northumbria University] want to hire the best people possible but now no-one from abroad will be looking to apply for a UK job over the next couple of years until Britain’s position in Europe becomes clearer. Equally, people in the UK are not making any long-term plans for working in the EU. \n“It’s like the Premier League; if you lose all of the best players from abroad you’re obviously going to be affected.” \nWhile some organisations have successfully braved the post-referendum turbulence, others have not been so lucky. One of the region’s best known architecture practices went out of business after the Brexit vote sent shockwaves through the construction industry. Redbox Design, which was formed in 1985 and worked on some of the region’s most iconic developments, saw five major projects either delayed or cancelled following June’s vote for Britain to leave the EU. The result was the closure of the company and the loss of 18 jobs. \nDespite setbacks such as this, business leaders are determined that Brexit won’t derail the drive to improve skills in the region. \nSerial entrepreneur Jeremy Middleton said having an enterprise adviser in every school and extending work experience placements from two weeks to 12 weeks would give young people a better chance of acquiring industry-ready skills. \nHe said: “Skills has been a weakness in the North East for a very long time. We were told in the [Tony] Blair years that we needed to improve skills and we can’t go on not addressing this issue. \n“Brexit takes away any excuses because the North East will become responsible for regional aid, not the EU. It’s very clear that we will have a substantial amount of money in our control. We have to be more self-reliant; we can’t just rely on Brussels.” Jeremy Middleton \nMr Middleton said he was putting skills development at the forefront of his campaign to become North East mayor. A few weeks ago the campaign looked as though it could be derailed by new Prime Minister Theresa May, who was thought to be ready to ditch plans for directly elected mayors. But since then Sajid Javid, the new communities and local government secretary, has confirmed that the mayoral model will be retained as part of any devolution deal. \nThe nature of this deal is still very much up in the air. But the feeling in the region is that skills development is vital regardless of whether devolution eventually happens or not. Mike Overfield, managing director of Geonet Solutions in Darlington, said: “We’ve ot to take control of our own destiny by bringing young people through and encouraging them to stay in the region. We’ll also still get skills imported from abroad. \n“The NHS and other services rely on people coming from further afield. There will be more restrictions, more checks carried out and more control over borders but that doesn’t mean that everyone will stop coming to the UK to work here.” \nMr Overfield said the growing impact of technology made the movement of free labour less important to industries such as IT and web design. \n“Providing you have a PC in front of you it doesn’t matter where you are in the world,” he said. “It’s very easy to produce a website, for example, without having to physically be in the office. \n“I think that things will carry on as normal. Europe and the rest of the world has pretty much taken it [Brexit] in their stride. All of the turmoil and the change of Prime Minister doesn’t seem to have had an effect. It has not spiralled out of control and there’s a feeling that things could be even better than they were before.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-02T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-02T09:32:28.676+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
