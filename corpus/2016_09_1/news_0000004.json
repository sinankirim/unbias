It doesn’t explain anything at all. Little wonder the public is growing increasingly impatient. \nThe EU Referendum was not an election campaign. Last year, our political parties ran on manifestos. If they won the election, they had a programme their government would attempt to make happen. \nWhen David Cameron won a surprise majority, his Conservative government moved swiftly to implement a manifesto commitment to holding a referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union. We all know now what happened next. \nBut few realise what the future holds. The government’s commitment to holding a referendum was only that – there would be a public vote, but there is no manifesto pledge to do anything about the result. \nIn law, a referendum result is advisory on Parliament but not binding. Parliament need do nothing at all legally. But, of course, there will be real political pressure – manifesto or not – to act on behalf of how the public had voted. And this is where Theresa May is beginning the test the public’s patience. \nThere is nothing new about campaign promises that are hard to believe or don’t happen. This problem of promising more than will be delivered has damaged public trust. \nI do not doubt that both Remain and Leave made promises that are problematic. It would have been much better if we had some clear picture about what Brexit would be – like in the referendum over Scotland’s independence. In that vote, the public could see a plan for what independence would look like. Each side could contest whether this plan was worth having, but at least there was something on the table. \nA leading figure in the students for Leave campaign made clear to me that Leave learned its lessons from Scotland’s vote. There would be no manifesto or plan so that criticisms would have no substance to pick apart. Better to keep the conversation about whether or not the public wants more control than actually specify what this really look like. \nWe were all sold bottles of bitter snake oil by pipedream, pro-Brexit merchants. \nRemember the pledge of an extra £350m each week to the NHS? Not £3.50 extra has been promised since. It didn’t take Nigel Farage 24 hours to say this big investment was not going to happen after all. Then again he also conceded defeat before Leave was in fact declared the winner. Yes, this is the kind of political ‘judgement’ we’ve come to expect from the twice former UKIP leader. \nBut let’s not focus on the made up number of £350m for the NHS. If there will be any savings – and it looks like a big ‘if’ – from leaving the European Union, then where will be this new investment? Thus far much has been said and nothing delivered. If this is the Brexit recipe for success, it won’t get far on the Great British Bake-off any time soon with these damp cakes. \nSome Leave campaigners promised us ‘more’ control on immigration. We never knew much about how this would happen beyond bringing to Britain an Australia-inspired points based system. \nYet there are more problems here. Points-based systems are designed to increase immigration – and this is why Australia started one. They award points for qualifications, salary, language fluency and other desirable factors. You add them up and if you have the right total or more then you can get a visa to work and live in the country easily. And that’s why Migration Watch has long opposed this system: it encourages immigration from those who can qualify rather than deter migrants from coming over. \nNow points-based immigration does not have to lead to more immigrants. You can limit the numbers that can qualify by capping the number of visas. Sound like an obvious compromise? Well, that is what Britain already does. \nYou read that here first: all those Brexit campaigners arguing for a points-based system didn’t know (or didn’t care) that Britain already has a points-based system – that caps the number of visas available. You can thank Tony Blair’s Labour Party for launching the system. Whoever knew Boris, Gove and Farage were pinching ideas on immigration from Blair that have been in place for years? (I know – I had to pass the points-based test to stay here.) \nIf this looks like Brexit campaigners don’t actually know how Britain’s immigration system has been working for years – why else promote a ‘new’ policy already in place? – then you’re catching on to how little substance is behind ‘Brexit means Brexit’. \nAnd that’s what we thought we knew. Now we learn from May that her government won’t support a points-based immigration post-Brexit. Somehow Brexit seems to actually mean something less ‘Brexit’. \nIf anything shouts danger ahead, it must be a Cabinet meeting for a ‘Brexit Brainstorm’ without any visible agreement about what will be different for Brexit Britain. \nSome believe that Brexit is simple: All we need do is leave and the future is ours. But the question is not only about what deal we’ll have for trade with the EU. This should be difficult enough – and the evidence suggests forging a deal outside the EU and EEA will take more than the two years available. That means we’ll be trading on similar terms as North Korea. Is that what getting freedom is going to look like? Doesn’t appear like a great leap forward to me. \nFinally, Britain must do much more than leave – it must figure out what it will be. Not every EU law is bad. No Brexit campaigner thinks maternity rights should end, or many other rights and protections guaranteed to EU citizens. We’ve been promised the good laws will stay – but be made British – and the bad ones will go. But no one made a list beyond a few soundbites about which of the 17,000 or more regulations we want to keep, amend or bin. This must all be agreed before Brexit happens – otherwise, we’re walking into chaos on purpose. \nAnd so the more May’s government looks at Brexit, the more complicated and thorny this path looks – and the less likely it will ever really happen. Already Brexit doesn’t mean what its supporters promised. \nIt’s unfortunate enough that Remainers feel let down. Soon we all will. \nThom Brooks is Head of Durham Law School and author of Becoming British: UK Citizenship Examined (Biteback 2016) @thom_brooks", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-09T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-08T21:05:29.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
