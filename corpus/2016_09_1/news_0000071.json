Study after study shows how London’s attention for – and investment in – her hinterlands stops at the commuter belt’s edge. \nThe Merseyside riots of 1981 made it clear how national policy completely failed Liverpool. It took Michael Heseltine flying in on his helicopter to kick-start regional leaders to turn around Merseyside’s fortunes and drive its reinvention as a European ‘Capital of Culture’. \nI was devastated in 2004 when the north east overwhelmingly rejected John Prescott’s devolution proposals. His plans for a light-touch assembly could never escape its portrayal as a talking shop and gravy train for pen-pushers and failed party hacks. \nThe idea of the assembly being a step on a journey lacks a populist unique selling point to match slashing red tape. The mirage of yet more politicians with their snouts in the trough persuaded the floating voter that an assembly would be yet another waste of public cash. \nScotland and Wales got their assemblies, and the north east was left behind. In Scotland, the Government was so powerful that it satisfied longstanding demands allowing a successful No campaign against independence. \nWales first got little more than the north east was offered, a glorified talking shop. But it proved its seriousness and evolved into a full Government giving direct Welsh control over important decisions affecting Wales’ future. Christopher Furlong/Getty Images Protesters gather in front of the Houses of Parliament as they demonstrate against the EU referendum result \nThe Welsh Government’ successfully distanced itself from the Tories’ junior doctors fiasco currently consuming England’s NHS . And all the devolved assemblies have an important seat at the table in national Brexit discussions. \nScotland is clear that it will never support a Brexit deal that weakens Scotland. In England by contrast, all the talk is of ‘passporting’ financial services, not retaining Nissan. \nNick Clegg’s recent autobiography revealed George Osborne ruthlessly slashing spending anywhere where there were no Tory votes to win.. The Conservative government looks out for the Home Counties, leaving us provincials to fend for themselves. \nAnd without serious regional leaders, the north east is vulnerable. So you might expect me to be disappointed by the recent collapse of plans for a City-Region mayor for ‘Tyne-Tees & Wear. \nBut I am not. An ex Newcastle University professor, John Tomaney, did great work teasing out the real meaning of Osborne’s Tory City-Mayor plans. He concludes that it’s basically about getting cities to compete aggressively and become “business friendly”, cutting taxes, public services and public wellbeing. \nHis analysis demonstrates how the City Mayor leadership model lacks any solid scientific base: Ken & Boris both show all to clearly the weaknesses of a strong single leader. 2012 Getty Images A commuter swipes his Oyster card at a London Underground station \nFor every sensible Oyster card or congestion charge scheme, you get the New Routemaster debacle, or public money thrown at private bridges or controversial Islamists. \nResearch shows strong city-regions have many partners who use their individual resources to make things collectively better. Effective regional leadership is a real team effort with no one individual calling the shots. \nOsborne’s devolution forces cuts on us and leaves to the new strong leader to decide where the axe falls. Its much vaunted £30m price tag is a con, a simple bait-and-switch. \nThat £30m is enough to realise a few megalomaniac prestige projects to secure an individual’s ‘legacy’. But it’s peanuts compared to the £400m the Government hacked from the north east’s late lamented Regional Development Agency. \nWe urgently need investment in schools, hospitals, public transport and the road infrastructure if the region is not to grind to a halt in coming decades. It’s not Mayors we need, but real leaders to step up, get us working together, to stake our claim in as London as a proud and self-reliant north east of England.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-24T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-23T20:06:02.689+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
