It has to count the pennies more carefully these days and so was only prepared to offer £15m. \nI’m a fan of the show myself and when it makes the switch I’ll carry on watching it. I like Channel 4, however I seem to be in a minority of fans with that view. \nI love Mel and Sue but can’t understand why they announced they were leaving it so soon after the decision was made public. Were their noses put out because they weren’t consulted, or have they got something against Channel 4? Ian West/PA Wire The Breat British Bake Off presenters Mel Giedroyc (left) and Sue Perkins \nThe ironic thing is I suspect many of the ‘how very dare they?’ brigade have at some time grumbled about the sprendthrift BBC and were keen to see it tighten its purse strings. \nNow it has agreed to take on the £750m cost of the subsidy for over-75s license fees after pressure from the Tories, it has had to, the result being bye bye to the GBBO . \nSome other popular shows might follow, what with this and the Beeb having to reveal how much it pays to its stars, another Tory brainwave. If only it was so full and frank about who its donors are and how much they hand over. All in good time, no doubt. \nPaul Hollywood has, according to some reports, intimated he will stay on after the Channel 4 move, but no white smoke so far from the Mary Berry hut to indicate what she’ll do. \nMary is the Tory poster girl of Middle England and might be uncomfortable being on the same station as ‘pinkos’ like Channel 4’s Jon Snow so I suspect she won’t follow Hollywood. \nAnd if she quits, who will the Tories blame that on? The last Labour government no doubt.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-18T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-17T20:34:38.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
