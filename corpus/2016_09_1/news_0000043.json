After a couple of months, the grind of the daily commute in the capital city meant that the novelty wore off, and Mr Harrold, who is now North East chair of insolvency trade body R3, began to look at other options. \nHe said: “London is in many respects a fantastic city but it’s very intense, so when an opportunity in Newcastle came up, I thought I’d take a look.” \nHe arrived by the Tyne on 14 July 1989 - “I remember the day very well” - and after being interviewed by Bill Flett and Graham Wright at Dickinson Dees, he was sent off round the city to see what he thought of it. \n“I had no preconceptions of what Newcastle might be like, but was instantly made to feel welcome by Bill and Graham. As I walked down Grey Street on what was a sunny summer’s day, I was impressed by what I saw and was sold on the quality of life on offer here.” \nMr Harrold spent the next three years with Dickinson Dees, requalifying as an English solicitor in the process, and also started to get his first experience of dealing with the insolvency sector in which he has gone on to specialise. \nHe said: “The North East proved to be very friendly and welcoming, and there were always plenty of social and sporting activities happening, especially between the various professional services firms around the region, so it was an ideal place to be for a young man who didn’t yet have any family responsibilities. \n“There was a lot of fallout in the early 1990s from the severe recession, with many companies being forced into insolvency by the high level of interest rates that are barely imaginable in today’s climate. I started to see how the business insolvency process worked, and also what tools insolvency practitioners used to try and help businesses get back on an even keel.” \nBy 1992, Mr Harrold decided that his working holiday ought to come to an end and he headed back to his home city, working for the major law firm that represented well-known Australian tycoon Alan Bond when he went bankrupt. After his now-wife Deborah came out to Perth for a holiday, however, he decided that coming back to the North East was the right option and he returned in September 1993. \n“Coming back was the biggest decision of my life, but one that I’ve never regretted,” he said. “The substantial commercial sector meant I could also fulfill my career ambitions here, but second time around, things were a bit different - it was going to be much more than a working holiday, it was for real.” \nMr Harrold joined Hay & Kilner Solicitors on his return, and has been with the firm ever since, working across every aspect of legal work surrounding personal and corporate insolvency within its commercial department. \nHe was also the first solicitor in the North East to pass the Joint Insolvency Examination Board exams which are required to qualify as a licensed insolvency practitioner. Neil Harrold of Hay and Kilner \n“It was a small North East insolvency community in the early 1990s, but a very active one, and many of those who were just starting out back then too have gone on to be the region’s leading practitioners today. \n“The physical, industrial and economic changes to the regional landscape have been quite dramatic since I first arrived in 1989, and have in essence made the story of the North East one of constant challenges, resilience and renewal while I’ve been here. \n“Hay & Kilner is a well-established North East business founded in 1946, and we work with a lot of SMEs based around the region, so we’ve seen first-hand the ups and downs of the regional economy and how the economic development questions that have been asked of us all have always been answered creatively and robustly. \n“The decline of the traditional heavy industries in the 1980s left a huge question hanging over the North East - what happens now? - but the transformation that followed has been remarkable, and can give us confidence, I think, in our ability to meet the future challenges that will be brought about by Brexit and everything that goes with it. \n“The Newcastle and Gateshead Quaysides have changed almost beyond recognition from when I first arrived into a vibrant place to live, work and play, with the Sage and the Baltic Arts Centre being world-class facilities that sit in a fantastic location overlooking the iconic bridges of the Tyne. \n“Our transport links, universities, skills base and infrastructure have also been improved markedly. What I particularly appreciate is that the Emirates link to Dubai means that it is no longer necessary to go via London in order to fly to Australia to visit family and friends, as well as opening up the region to them coming here for a holiday. It has also been a boon for North East businesses in expanding export markets and attracting inward investment from Asia and Australasia. \n“There’s a can-do attitude in the North East, and an optimism that’s based on realism - we tend not to go to the extremes of economic joy and despair that are sometimes seen elsewhere, and deal with the challenges that confront us with a level-headed belief that they can be overcome.” Neil Harrold of Hay and Kilner \nIn 2012, Mr Harrold joined the regional committee of R3, which is the UK’s insolvency and restructuring trade body, and took over as chair earlier this year. \nR3 promotes best practice for professionals working with financially-troubled individuals and businesses, and draws its North East members from many of the region’s best-known professional services firms. \n“The insolvency and restructuring profession has also evolved massively during my time working in it, and a great deal of lessons have been learned over the years. There’s now a much more planned and professional approach to dealing with distress, effecting rescue and saving the jobs that troubled companies support, with the emphasis often being on actions that happen well away from the spotlight. \n“While the general public’s perception of insolvency practitioners is most likely still based on those that are left to clear up the mess of high-profile businesses in distress, such as Woolworths or BHS, much of our best work goes ‘under the radar’ and happens without an insolvency process ever being launched. \n“If we can work with a management team to find new investors, generate cash flow by disposing of non-essential assets or find other solutions to a company’s problems without having to resort to formal processes, then it’s clearly far better for everyone involved. \n“The regularity with which this happens is testament to the quality of the North East’s insolvency community and the work that practitioners do, and even if it doesn’t always make the headlines, the tangible impact that this work has is quite striking. \n“Recent R3 research found that, in 2013/14, more than two in five insolvent firms across the north of England had been rescued with the direct involvement of an insolvency practitioner, which equates to well over 2,000 companies and 90,000 jobs being saved.” \nAs chair of R3 North East, Mr Harrold is responsible for leading campaigns which highlight the benefits of accessing services provided by insolvency practitioners across the region for both individuals and businesses with financial concerns. \nHe and other North East practitioners are also directly involved in campaigning work at national governmental level which aims to ensure for the UK’s insolvency regime remains flexible and efficient at saving struggling businesses and helping indebted individuals. \n“Proactively tackling financial problems as soon as they become apparent, whether corporate or personal, is crucial in maximising the chances of solving them, and there are a wide range of tools and procedures that can be put in place to find a positive way forward. \n“Our biggest message is that the earlier a company or person looks for help, the more likely it is that they can find a positive outcome, so if you can see financial storm clouds starting to gather around your business or yourself, proactively looking to do something about them is always the best course of action. \n“The insolvency regime is a fundamental part of the business cycle, helping to ensure that talent, assets and ideas are put to productive use and that creditors are repaid money wherever possible, and the regional knowledge that the North East insolvency profession has is absolutely crucial in making it work as efficiently as possible. \n“Having this presence on the ground means there is a wealth of local and specialist knowledge available. We know which contacts we might approach to invest in or buy a particular business, or can see other opportunities for helping it overcome its problems.” Neil Harrold of Hay and Kilner \nThe business and insolvency implications of the Brexit vote are still far from clear, but Mr Harrold believes that the North East is equipped to manage whatever the future holds, and to take advantage of new opportunities that will arise. \n“It’s a big world out there, and the export success that the North East already enjoys provides a terrific platform from which businesses here can target any number of new markets in the post-Brexit era. \n“There will always be bumps in the road, both for individual companies and the regional economy as a whole. They may well be felt strongly in the coming years, which makes sustaining our drive towards building a clearer understanding of how insolvency practitioners work, more important than ever.” What car do you drive? \nJaguar XF What’s your favourite restaurant? \nCafé de Turin in Nice – great seafood, simply served.
