We have to ask whether the deal that’s agreed with Europe suits people.\n“This will be the biggest decision since the second world war and we’ve got to get it right.”\nIn a sign of her weakened position, Prime Minister Theresa May was forced to back down in the face of pressure from Tory rebels as the Government pushed Brexit legislation through Parliament. An activist waves European Union and Union flags outside the Houses of Parliament in Westminster (Image: PA)\nShe agreed to accept amendments supported by arch-Eurosceptics including Jacob Rees-Mogg.\nDonald Trump would not be welcome in the UK under a Labour government, says John McDonnell\nThe compromise was designed to avoid a rebellion by Conservatives opposed to her proposed Brexit deal.\nAs the mutiny within the party continued, another ministerial aide quit over the Prime Minister’s “watered down” Brexit plan.\nNorth Cornwall MP Scott Mann resigned as parliamentary private secretary to the Treasury, saying he was not willing to “compromise” the wishes of consttuents by delivering “a watered down Brexit.”\nSo far, nine Conservatives have resigned from various roles in protest at the Chequers deal.\nThey include Brexit Secretary David Davis, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Minister Steve Barker.\nCabinet minister Greg Clark pleaded with Tory Eurosceptics to support the Government’s customs bill.\nHe urged Tory colleagues who “want to get on with Brexit” to acknowledge that the Bill was “essential” and should not be impeded. European Union and Union flags outside the Houses of Parliament in Westminster (Image: PA)\nBut Brexiteer Tory MP Sir Bernard Jenkin said the Chequers plan was “dead”, telling BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I’m afraid it is neither beloved by Remainers or Leavers.\n“It’s also quite likely to be either rejected by the EU or more demands will be made upon it so it will be even less acceptable.”\nWith the Prime Minister under fire from all sides, the imminent summer break may provide her with a temporary respite.\nThe House of Commons breaks up for the summer recess on Tuesday July 24. With MPs back in their constituencies, there will be no Commons votes providing an opportunity to challenge her authority.\nHowever, things could come to a head at the party conference in Birmingham at the beginning of October.\nAnd, if she survives that long, Mrs May will attend a summit of European leaders on October 18 in Brussels, where she hopes the details of Brexit will be agreed.\nThe PM has mounted a diplomatic charm offensive over recent days to sell the plan to EU leaders like German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\nBut the Brussels establishment is still likely to baulk at provisions which it regards as “cherry-picking” the advantages of EU membership while dodging obligations.
