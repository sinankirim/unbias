So I say this to the Tory party, our jobs are not yours to play Russian roulette with. Drop your red lines and secure a decent deal, one that is to the benefit of the working people of this country.\n“And if you cannot agree to put people before your ideology then move over and let a party that will get on with it.”\nDr Ralf Speth, chief executive of JLR, said the company’s “heart and soul” is in the UK.\nHe said:\nHowever, we and our partners in the supply chain face an unpredictable future if the Brexit negotiations do not maintain free and frictionless trade with the EU and unrestricted access to the single market.\nWe urgently need greater certainty to continue to invest heavily in the UK and safeguard our suppliers, customers and 40,000 British-based employees.\nA bad Brexit deal would cost Jaguar Land Rover more than £1.2bn profit each year.
