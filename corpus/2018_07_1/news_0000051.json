This is one of them. An anti Brexit rally at the Monument attended by a large crowd.

One option in the vote would be to reject the deal and stay im the EU instead.\nCritics say it’s simply calling for a second EU referendum. Supporters of the People’s Vote campaign say the public can only know what the future holds for the UK once the deal has been published, and they should then be allowed to vote on whether they back it or not.\nRallies and marches are also taking place in Bristol, Cambridge, Birmingham, Liverpool, Edinburgh and Cardiff.\nCampaigners say they are shifting their focus from politicians in Westminster to people across the country.\nMr Lineker said: “I spent most of the last few weeks totally focused on a fantastic World Cup. But it was impossible to avoid what was happening in the Brexit debate back home. Now I’m back I find the whole thing more bewildering and worrying than ever.

That is why I think there should be a People’s Vote on the final deal, and why I am sending best wishes and good luck to the campaigners who will be stepping up the pressure over the summer.”\nCampaigners also plan another march through central London, on October 20, and they say this promises to be the biggest Brexit protest yet.\nThere will also be a series of national Action Days staged by People’s Vote’s 130 local volunteer groups, and the ambitious target has been set of increasing those to 200 local groups by the end of this period.\nAhead of each march and rally, the campaign will publish authoritative new research showing the impact of Brexit on communities and industries across the country - drilling into data, local institutions and local people’s stories.\nThe People’s Vote campaign is also commissioning detailed opinion polling of specific areas and groups to show how, where and why public opinion is moving.\nThe summer of action is designed to pile pressure on MPs ahead of any meaningful vote on Brexit later this year.
