It’s lower than the lowest of gutter politics.\n“You’re both a total disgrace & puts to shame the integrity of the mother of all parliaments.”\nConservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis had been “paired” with Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson, who is on maternity leave following the birth of her second son.\nBut the Tory MP then took part in two crunch Commons votes on Tuesday night and helped Prime Minister Theresa May narrowly avoid a damaging defeat on Brexit trade plans.\nMrs May has said Mr Lewis voted by mistake. She told MPs: “The breaking of the pair was done in error. It wasn’t good enough and will not be repeated.”\nBut the Times reported that Mr Smith, the chief whip, urged Mr Lewis and two other Tory MPs to vote despite being paired.\nThe Times said it has been told that the two other Conservative MPs ignored Mr Smith’s instruction.

If true, Julian Smith must resign, or be sacked.” Read More Leave campaign 'cheated' to win EU referendum - now North East MP wants Brexit to be scrapped\nIf Mr Smith does resign, he would be the third Cabinet Minister to quit Theresa May’s Government in recent weeks.\nFormer Brexit Secretary Davis Davis and former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson both resigned in protest at the Government’s proposed Brexit deal.\nHowever, the Prime Minister’s spokesman insisted she still had full confidence in both Mr Smith and Mr Lewis.\nSome Tories have also raised concerns about the claims.\nThey include MP Heidi Allen, who said: “I sincerely hope this isn’t true. No matter how tough the going gets, principle, integrity and standards matter. Without those, what’s left?” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": ["https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/nechronicle/subscriptions/&quot;}"], "published": "2018-07-19T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-07-19T18:30:27.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
