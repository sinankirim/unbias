If they win, they'll face France in Sunday's final.\nThe petition points out that not much work will get done on Monday should the Three Lions lift the World Cup in Moscow on Sunday.\nIt says: \"If England win the world cup, the Monday should be made a bank holiday for 2018.\n\"We need this for all those supporting England as the next day will not be pleasant for all fans.\" There is strong support from the North East for a World Cup win Bank Holiday (Image: Parliament.uk)\nEngland fans in the North East are among those backing the petition the most. Its map shows North East constituencies shaded in dark red tones, indicating many people in the region support the idea.\nIf a Government petition is signed by more then 100,000, then it will be considered for a debate in Parliament.\nHowever, its author Liam Betson is yet to receive an official response to his campaign.

As you may have heard, there is is quite a lot on the Government's plate at the moment, with cabinet ministers resigning in a Brexit row and the possibility of Prime Minister Theresa May facing a vote of no confidence .\nHowever, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had previously backed calls for a celebration if Kane and co. lift the cup on Sunday.
