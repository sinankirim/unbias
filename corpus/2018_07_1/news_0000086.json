As part of this, the company is looking grow its number of SME customers from 30,000 to 130,000.\nIt will also attempt to win a 5% share of the UK and Ireland corporate controls market by July 2021. Utilitywise CEO, Brendan Flattery\nBrendan Flattery, chief executive officer of Utilitywise, said: “Utilitywise is firmly focused on significantly increasing its market share by broadening its target market and the services it provides its customers, in order to drive returns for shareholders. That means the company will have to evolve its proposition and channel strategy, as detailed above, while optimising operational productivity.\n“The strategy update outlined today will enable Utilitywise to meet its two new financial targets, as well as maximising the medium term potential from the business.”\nUtilitywise’s enterprise division’s strategy comprises four key points, with the most noticeable focusing on the use of a price comparison website.\nThe website already exists but is working at, what the firm describes as, “a relatively modest scale”. However, the company is planning to increase its investment in the service during the 2018/19 financial year.

Turnover during the period also grew by 3.5% from £38.4m to £39.7m.
