It made me proud of the city I was born in and grateful for the working-class roots which are instilled in me and so many hard-working people whose lives we get a little insight into during the series.\nHaving attended the premiere at Sunderland Empire last week, a friend of mine asked: \"Is it strange that I felt a little emotional after watching that?\"\nAbsolutely not. The series is shrouded in passion and emotion throughout. It's one of the many fantastic ways that producers Fulwell73 have captured Sunderland AFC and what it is like to support the club. The passion, the love, the significance. It is deeply moving.\nIt's so much more than just a football documentary.\nExplaining why fans feature so heavily throughout, as does the history and culture of the city, executive producer Ben Turner told me: \"Reflecting the passionate fans and the city and its history and culture was always going to be a big part of the documentary. That was important for us.\n“When you start a project like this you think about what the relevance is going to be to elevate it beyond just a club shop DVD.\n“To get it on Netflix we need to reach an international audience, and the opportunity for us was to put on screen what it is that we really love about the football club that we’ve followed all of our lives.\n“I think there’s a residence in the modern world, with politics with Brexit and Trump and all that, these communities that seem to be a little left behind and forgotten about. Sunderland can definitely fall into that. Sunderland Netflix documentary\n“So what the club represents to that city goes way beyond winning on a football pitch. Partly because sadly they don’t win on the football pitch very often, but also partly because of the way that the community is.\n“So the opportunity for us across the eight episodes was to really try and give the sense of what that football club is to the people because that’s more interesting to people than what tactics are they going to be playing week in, week out, I think.”\nFulwell73 capture that excellently througout. It should be noted that they are Sunderland supporters - as their name suggests. They've worked on documentaries with sporting legends such as David Beckham, Usain Bolt and Sir Mo Farah, but Sunderland Til I Die was an altogether more personal project for them.

Fulwell73 hope so\nThat is reflected in what unfolds.\nSure, there will be plenty to be embarrassed, sad and even angry about. In the most part all of those emotions are drawn up from the action on the pitch, or the lack of it in the boardroom.\nBut in general, the production captures life as a Sunderland supporter perfectly, and will serve as a representation to a global audience of what makes Sunderland AFC such a special football club. Sunderland fans celebrate on the final whistle (Image: Sunderland AFC)\nThey have access to so much too. From interviewing chief executive Martin Bain often, to also highlighting the hard work of people behind the scenes who work for the club but are Sunderland born and bred and genuinely care, the access is unique and unlike anything you would usually get to see.\nOne thing they do lack though, for anybody who watched the recent Manchester City Amazon Prime documentary, is dressing room footage. It's notable that cameras obviously weren't allowed everywhere like they were for Pep Guardiola's team talks. But in truth, they were very sanitised and likely set-up for the cameras so we probably don't miss much for not having that access, as nice as it would have been if genuine.\nIf nothing else, the many, many mistakes and bad fortune you will see throughout the documentary will just serve to make you even more thankful for new owner Stewart Donald, who makes a brief appearance in episode eight to give the series its brighter, hopeful conclusion.

But Sunderland documentary was always Fulwell73's dream\nSunderland Til I Die might follow the club during one of its toughest seasons in recent history, but somehow you emerge from it feeling prouder than ever to be part of the red-and-white army. I'd encourage every Sunderland fan to watch it.
