The frame of the firm’s new factory – which is being constructed by North East based Howard Russell - is now fully in place, with work set to complete in spring.\nSnop will take more than 17 acres of the first phase of IAMP, opening a factory and office space with the potential to expand to 331,000 sq ft.

We know that we can enjoy direct access to a fantastic talent pool, as well as benefiting from the other excellent assets this site offers, including outstanding connectivity to road, sea, air and rail links.”\nHe added: “We really are confident about our future here and this investment shows that. We look forward to a successful future at IAMP.”\nSnop will relocate from its existing premises nearby, taking on more people and significantly increasing its floorspace.\nWith the additional capacity created, the company expects to see turnover grow from 54m Euros to 90m, with an additional 100 to 150 jobs created in the process, on top of the firm’s existing 250-strong team.

It’s a hugely significant step forward for IAMP, and we are certain this is the first of a number of exciting developments on this special site.”\nAs sell as investing more than £15m in the new building Snop will spend an additional 15m Euros on new machinery. It is working with Silverstone Building Consultancy to project manage the construction project, with the building expected to fully handed-over in May 2019.\nCramlington-headquartered construction firm Howard Russell is building the new facility on behalf of Snop UK.\nAs a result, the firm has been able to recruit two new apprentices as well as creating three new permanent jobs including an engineer, a contracts manager and a pre-construction manager, with the need for a number of additional roles in the near future.\nCraig Muldoon, technical and sales director at Howard Russell, added: “It is fantastic for Howard Russell to have won such a high-profile North East project. We were up against strong competition from five other major players in the construction sector, so we are delighted to have been awarded the contract and it gives us a strong platform to show the industry that regional SMEs are capable of delivering these projects to the same standard as large national contractors, while still offering a personal service.” Read More Automotive sector warns of 'catastrophic' no-deal Brexit for North East\n“Since the recession we have had to work nationally to secure large industrial projects of this nature and we have grown our business with projects in London and the South. To see this level of investment in the North East is fantastic for the construction industry. We hope that this investment and recognition of what the North East has to offer continues.”\nAt the heart of the North East, IAMP is located next to the UK’s largest car manufacturing plant, Nissan, and will provide a world-class environment for the automotive supply chain and related advanced manufacturing businesses. The park is being delivered in partnership by Sunderland City Council and South Tyneside Council.\nCouncillor Iain Malcolm, Leader of South Tyneside Council, said: “IAMP is a special site and we always had a great deal of confidence that it would prove to be attractive to businesses in the manufacturing sector, because of its natural assets.\n“The announcement that Snop will become our first occupier on site is great news, and we are looking forward to welcoming more businesses to IAMP over the coming weeks, months and years. This is a site that – both in the short and long term – will deliver a significant number of jobs for people in this region and positively contribute to UK Plc.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": ["https://communicatoremail.com/IN/DCF/wo13VulRxfnD9_IKKGjv78/", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/nechronicle/subscriptions/&quot;}"], "published": "2018-12-05T17:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-12-05T21:42:20.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
