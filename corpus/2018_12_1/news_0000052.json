He then worked on the project in collaboration with well-known artist Jo Mortimer who produced a series of artworks to illustrate the book.\nAndrew said the inspiration for the poems came from a lifetime of working with children as well as keeping five grandchildren entertained.\n“I aim to make my poems fun with lots of rhythm and rhyme, he said. “Hopefully in this way they have a musical appeal when read out loud.\n“Most of the ideas seem quite silly, but children appear to enjoy the fun and nonsense.” Read More Campaigners head to Tiverton calling for a People's Vote on Brexit\nJo’s whose iconic paintings of Tiverton have proved immensely popular has designed the town’s official Christmas card for the last six years and has also organised several people participation artworks, some of which are now on display around Tiverton.\n“I loved the idea of illustrating Andrew’s poems and found them quite inspirational. The whole project was a lot of fun, and I enjoyed teasing out ideas from the words.”\nThe book is now available at Tiverton’s independent bookstore, Liznojan, in Gold Street.
