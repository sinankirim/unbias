It compares the cost of several festive items, including ingredients for a Christmas dinner, a 6ft Christmas tree and the best-selling present from that year. It also includes traditional items, like a lump of coal.\nResults have revealed that 2018 will be the cheapest year to buy a Christmas dinner for a family of four, with the bill coming in at just £25.35. In comparison, the most expensive year was 1975, which works out at an eye-watering £57.92 in today’s money, taking inflation into account.\nCost of Christmas Past also allows users to view which years have been the most and least expensive for buying presents. For example, taking inflation into account, the best-selling toy in 1995 was POGs at just 93p each, while in 2005 it was an Xbox 360 that set parents back £436.54.
