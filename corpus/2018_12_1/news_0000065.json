We’ve heard Mark Carney say if we gave a no deal our economy will shrink by 9.3 per cent.\n“That will affect your customers, your staff, who may not be on big incomes.\n“It’ll hit them in the pocket directly. Won’t that then hit you in the pocket?”\nTM : “We are used to the bad and inaccurate forecasts from Mark Carnage….”\nLL : “I’m sorry, did you say Mark Carnage?”\nTM : “Yes. He said in the immediate aftermath of the vote in 2016, along with George Osborne and others, that unemployment would rise over 18 months by half a million and that interest rates would go up and we would be £4,300 worse off eventually.\n“None of it has come to pass.\n“We take what he says with an enormous pinch of salt.\n“I’m asking for people to look at the maths.\n“The UK public is sensible, so if you don’t pay £39 billion they know that’s a big plus for the country.\n“If you eliminate tariffs on oranges and coffee, which at the moment are collected by the UK Government and sent to Brussels, you can reduce prices without the Government losing any money.” poll loading What do you think of May's Brexit deal? 0+ VOTES SO FAR It's the only sensible way to leave the EU #BRINO Put it to a People's Vote Let's just stay in the EU\nLL : “But, and I’m just being Devil’s advocate, there’s no guarantee we’ll get all these free trade agreements is there?\n“A lot of people are worried about breaking away from our biggest trading partner.”\nTM : “You don’t need free trade agreements.\n\"What I’m suggesting is the so-called free trade EU is really just imposing protectionist tariffs on the 93 per cent of the world outside the EU.\n“We can get rid of those tariffs and opt for free trade and be much more of a free trading nation outside the EU.\n“There has been a smokescreen cast over that by Carney, Osborne and others who want us to remain in the EU and they are just misleading the public.”\n*Mr Martin bangs the table*\n“We are better off on Day 1 – 29 March - to leave without a deal because we can adopt free trade.\n“I’m going round the country because there has been a big campaign of disinformation by the FT, the CBI and others to persuade the public that food prices will go up…\" Tim Martin setting out his best Brexit in The High Cross (Image: Peter Fothergill)\nLL : “By 10 per cent according to the Governor of the Bank of England…\"\nTM : “It’s not true because you can eliminate tariffs and the public get it.\n\"Mark carnage can say that but people understand that without tariffs food prices will go down.”\nLL : “But with respect, and I appreciate when you say that a disrespectful question normally then follows….\"\nTM (smiling) : “Of course, go on….\"\nLL : “Well, why should people believe the boss of Wetherspoons over the Governor of the Bank of England?”\nTM : “Because the Governor of the Bank of England got it wrong in 2016.\n\"He said we were going to end up in recession and that interest rates would go up.\n“He said house prices were going to go down. He was wrong on all those things. He’s got a record of being wrong.\n“He’s not good at forecasts and the public rejected what he and the Treasury said in 2016.\n“You have to have faith in the public and they think Carney is not making economic sense but he’s making political statements because he wants to stay in the EU.”\nLL : “So you’ve come to Leicester. It’s a city that voted to Remain – just, by 51 per cent to 49 per cent – have any of your customers told you they disagree with you?”\nTM : “A lot of people have seen the way the EU has behaved and can see tremendous and unjustified pressure has been put on the UK to accept a deal that ties our hands in the future.\n“They are sympathetic to the argument we will be more prosperous and democratic outside the EU.\n“Obviously not everyone here says that but that is the way the wind is blowing.” Read More ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-12-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-12-05T20:09:12.060+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
