Theresa May would stay on as Prime Minister for a while even if she loses\nBut losing this vote wouldn't mean she has to resign as Prime Minister immediately.\nIn the UK system of Government, the country always has a Prime Minister. Read More What is a vote of no confidence? Theresa May clings on to power amid Brexit deal chaos\nAnd that means Mrs May will carry on until somebody else is ready to replace her.\nIn practice, that means that she stays in Number 10 until the Conservatives have chosen a new leader. Prime Minister Theresa May makes a statement outside 10 Downing Street, London, after the 1922 Committee announced that enough Conservative MPs have requested a vote of confidence in Mrs May to trigger a leadership contest.\nIf she insisted in resigning early then nobody can stop her. The Queen would probably need to appoint her deputy, the Cabinet Office Minister David Liddington, as a temporary Prime Minister while the leadership election is underway.\nBut there's no reason to think Theresa May would do this. How long would a Conservative leadership contest take?\nIt's thought that the contest could be held over the Christmas break.\nHowever, Theresa May said a new leader would not be in place by the January 21, the deadline for a Commons vote on the Brexit deal.\nThere are two stages to a Conservative leadership election. Read More Theresa May statement IN FULL: Prime Minister vows to survive vote of no confidence in leadership\nFirst, MPs choose their two top candidates.\nThen, Conservative Party members hold a vote to decide who out of those two contenders becomes their leader. The new leader will then become Prime Minister\nOnce a new Conservative leader is in place, they become Prime Minister.\nThat's because they would be able to command the support of a majority of MPs in the House of Commons.\nThe Conservatives don't have a majority on their own. They depend on the support of 10 MPs from the DUP, a Northern Ireland party.\nBut the DUP have already said they will continue to support the Tories regardless of who the party leader is.\nThe one thing that would change their minds is if a Conservative government succeeded in getting the House of Commons to approve plans for the \"backstop\" - part of the proposed Brexit withdrawal agreement, which the DUP firmly oppose. Read More\nHowever, it looks very unlikely that the Commons will ever support the backstop as it currently stands. Theresa May could resign even if she wins the confidence vote\nIf Theresa May wins the confidence vote than she can continue as party leader. Under Conservative party rules, a new vote can't be held for 12 months.\nBut it's possible she might feel obliged to resign anyway.\nFor example, if 100 Tory MPs vote against her then, according to the rules, she can carry on - but she might feel that so many of her own MPs oppose her that she can't really get anything done.
