For example, often we see smaller businesses wanting to work within manufacturing or automotive but don’t know how to penetrate the market.\n“Through this programme and the partners’ vast networks, we can give valuable advice delivered both at events and via one to one support to help them on that journey.\n“A key benefit that businesses will gain is that they will build more diverse revenue streams, reducing reliance on a few customers and markets, which is particularly important with Brexit on the horizon.
