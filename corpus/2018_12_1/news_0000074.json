The coastal towns will be better off and that will have spin-off effects for the residents.\"\n4) “We’ll regain more democracy - and democracy is economic steroids.”\n5) “Finally, it’s going to help the Leicester Tigers rugby team because with more democracy it will do even better than they did in the past.\n\"I played one game for them in 1976 – in the second row.\n“I actually switched from Nottingham where I played a few games for Nottingham 1sts and I though I’d go to Leicester who were the better team – but I injured my back so I didn’t get on to the pitch.” poll loading Do you agree with Tim Martin on Brexit? 0+ VOTES SO FAR Yes - it's best for Britain (and Tigers as well) No - I prefer French wine to Australian, to be honest Like us on Facebook ", "external_links": ["https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/leicestermercury/subscriptions/&quot;}", "https://communicatoremail.com/IN/DCF/Ad9Bw6ZcmPSmMwDi7On4yR/", "https://mab.data.tm-awx.com/rhs&quot;,&quot;modularCss&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;nativeAppBanner&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;newslettersURL&quot;:&quot;https://communicatoremail.com/IN/DCF/Ad9Bw6ZcmPSmMwDi7On4yR/&quot;,&quot;GDPRConsentEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;PWA&quot;:&quot;{\\&quot;trackOffline\\&quot;:true}&quot;,&quot;bundledCss&quot;:&quot;false&quot;}}}"], "published": "2018-12-05T19:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-12-05T20:27:55.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
