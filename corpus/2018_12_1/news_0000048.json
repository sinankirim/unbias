Jonathan Bullock, UKIP’s energy spokesman, says he is concerned about Mr Batten’s links with the founder of the English Defence League and his decision to appoint him as an advisor.\nIn a statement today Mr Bullock said: “When I joined UKIP six years ago I had a meeting with Nigel Farage and asked one key question - how are you going to keep out the far right? - and he explained how the BNP and English Defence League were banned and how the constitution proscribed discrimination. \"I have over the course of the last few months challenged the current leader, Gerad Batten, over his increasing support for Tommy Robinson who is perceived to be ‘far-right’, banned from membership and breaks the constitution which proscribes discrimination on grounds of religion. \" Read More UKIP leader Gerard Batten wants people to boycott Walkers Crisps after Gary Lineker Brexit row\nHe added: \"The National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party had the opportunity to uphold the constitution when the leader announced that he was appointing Robinson as an advisor and that they would both speak at a Brexit rally today (Sunday), but it chose to keep the leader in position.\n\"The contract with MEPs, and the party members has thus been broken.\n\"I will therefore be joining with Nigel Farage and other colleagues in writing to resign from UKIP. It is with great regret and disappointment that I have come to this conclusion.\n“I will remain in the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy group in the European Parliament under Nigel’s leadership.
