In other words, you won’t pay any income tax at all until you earn this much.\nAssuming you have an annual income of at least £12,500, you’ll probably pay £130 less tax a year.\nAnd the threshold for the higher rate of income tax - the 40% rate - will increase to £50,000-a-year.\nIt means that some people on higher salaries (more than £46,351-a-year) will also gain.\nWhat does that mean? “A £130 a year gain for anyone earning over £12,500,” said Money Saving Expert's Martin Lewis.\nThere will also be more cash for the better off – with the point you start paying 40% income tax moving from £46,350 to £50,000.\n“Which means another £730 in the pay packets of people who are above £50,000,” Martin added.\nHowever, the super-rich won't get the full benefit – for once – with people making more than £100,000 not benefiting as much or even at all. Supermarket equal pay claims\nDecisions on separate tribunal cases on the issue of equal pay involving Tesco, Asda, Morrisons and Sainsbury’s are expected in 2019.\nIt involves female shop workers who feel they are paid less than their male warehouse workers, despite carrying out a similar role. The decisions made could impact on other workers in future. National Minimum Wage for sleep-ins\nThe Court of Appeal says people working sleep-in shifts, such as nurses and care workers, are not entitled to the National Minimum Wage for time spent asleep where they were ‘available for work’ and not ‘actually working’.\nA request to appeal this decision was lodged with the Supreme Court by Unison and a decision is expected in 2019.

(Image: Daniel Leal-Olivas/PA Wire)\nEuropean workers living in the UK can apply for settled status in 2019, allowing them to remain indefinitely after the end of the Brexit transition period in 2021.\nTo be granted settled status individuals must prove they have been living in the UK for five years by the date of application.
