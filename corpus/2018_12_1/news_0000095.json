They include Labour MP Chuka Umunna and Conservative MP Anna Soubry. Read More\nBut recently, more MPs have been saying they support it. North East MPs include Catherine McKinnell (Lab Newcastle North) and Sedgefield MP Phil Wilson (Lab).\nTheresa May says she opposes a People's Vote. Read More\nLabour's official policy is to keep the option of supporting a People's Vote \"on the table\" in some circumstances. How would a referendum work?\nIt would be a lot like the last referendum. You'd vote in a polling station (a bit like in a general election) and there would probably be TV debates.\nWhat's not clear though is what options would be on the ballot paper.\nPossibilities include:\ni) Supporting the Government's Brexit deal\nii) Leaving the EU with no Brexit deal\niii) Cancelling Brexit. How the North East voted in the EU Referendum in June 2016\nNewcastle: Remain 65,404 (50.7%); Leave 63,598 (49.3%)\nSunderland: Remain 51,930 (38.7%); Leave 82,394 (61.3%)\nNorth Tyneside: Remain 52,873 (46.63%); Leave 60,589 (53.37%)\nGateshead: Remain 44,429 (43.2%); Leave 58,529 (56.8%)\nSouth Tyneside: Remain 30,014 (38%); Leave 49,065 (62%)\nDurham: Remain 113,521 (42.5%); Leave 153,877 (57.5%)\nNorthumberland: Remain 82,022 (46%); Leave 96,699 (54%)\nHowever, it seems like a bad idea to have three different options. It might well mean that none of them get a majority of the votes.\nSo you might have only two choices. The problem then is, how do you choose which two to include?\nIt's an awkward issue. Most supporters of a People's Vote have avoided getting into an argument about the options.\nIt's possible an independent body could make the decision about what the question on the ballot paper should be.
