What plans does your authority have in place to mitigate potential risks associated with Brexit?' Councillor Nick Oliver (Image: Copyright Unknown)\nCoun Nick Oliver, the cabinet member for corporate services, said: \"None of us really knows (what will happen with Brexit). What's fairly certain is that there will be some kind of decline in economic growth in 2019-20 as many economists were predicting that, regardless of Brexit.\n\"The key thing we can be doing as a local authority is sound financial management. I'm confident there's a healthy level of reserves, we have to manage budgets properly and drive through budget cuts.\n\"At the same time, we have to do what we can to increase our income and make Northumberland an attractive place to come to do business.\" Read More D-Day for 96 homes plan as developers bid to build brand new estate\nTwo of the other key questions in the briefing, as highlighted by chairman Coun Georgina Hill, related to social housing and cyber security.\nCoun Oliver said: \"We are determined to build more social housing and to support community-led schemes. Community-led housing is really interesting and John Riddle (cabinet member for housing) was meeting the Housing Minister recently to ask him to support us on that.\"\nOn cyber security, he added: \"I don't know the detail, but I am confident that we are taking that really seriously and there are mechanisms for reporting any breaches.\" Read More Amble school still requires improvement but is heading in the right direction, says Ofsted\nElsewhere in the report was a section on the struggling retail sector, which had caught the eye of Coun Mark Swinburn.\n\"Our economic strategy has a focus on town centres,\" Coun Oliver said, explaining that the administration is mindful of vacancy rates and also wants to encourage town-centre living.\n\"We are trying to get more young people to move into town centres to live there, spend money and regenerate the night-time economy,\" he added.
