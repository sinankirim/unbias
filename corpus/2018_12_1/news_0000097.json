This unequivocal and unconditional decision must be communicated in writing to the European Council.\"\nThe ECJ ruling comes ahead of Tuesday's crunch vote on Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal.\nThe court ruled, contrary to the UK Government's position, that the case is \"relevant and not hypothetical\".\nHowever, the UK Government has said its policy is not to revoke Article 50.\nThe case was brought by a cross-party group of Scottish politicians, Labour MEPs Catherine Stihler and David Martin, SNP MP Joanna Cherry and MEP Alyn Smith, and Green MSPs Andy Wightman and Ross Greer, together with lawyer Jolyon Maugham QC, director of the Good Law Project. Read More Katie Hopkins branded 'racist' as angry protester barges into pro-Brexit rally\nThey argued that unilateral revocation is possible and believe it could pave the way for an alternative option to Brexit, such as a People's Vote to enable remaining in the EU.\nLawyers representing the Council of the European Union and from the European Commission argued that revocation is possible but would require unanimous agreement from all member states.\nThe case was originally heard by the Court of Session in Edinburgh and two attempts by the UK Government to appeal against the referral to the European Court were rejected.\nThe case will be referred back to the Court of Session, where judges are expected to \"frank\" the decision and declare the European Court's answer to be the law on the matter.
