Often victims are not locked away but hide in plain sight; in nail bars, hairdressers, car washes, and on farms or in factories. It is wrong to assume it only occurs overseas; the Government estimates that at least 13,000 people across Britain are trapped as modern slaves.\nThe Modern Slavery Act 2015 was a pioneering piece of legislation by our Government covering compulsory labour, sexual exploitation, domestic servitude, organ harvesting, and human trafficking. The Act consolidated these existing slavery offences, increased sentences for them, and banned prosecuting victims of slavery for crimes they were forced to commit by their traffickers. The Act also established an independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner to overlook the UK’s policies to tackle slavery. Increasing number of reports of modern slavery and exploitation also accounts for rise in crime reports\nThe Act was globally groundbreaking and since its implementation there has been a significant uplift in law enforcement activities against human traffickers. There are, however, improvements that need to be made in the way we combat this crime.

The statement must declare what steps the organisation has taken during the financial year to ensure slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in any of its supply chains or in any part of its own business. However, serious concerns have been raised about the limitations of the statement requirement on businesses. Anne Marie Morris MP\nNon-governmental organisations such as the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre maintain registries of businesses that are compliant in publishing a statement. Disappointingly, these records show that less than half of all businesses who should be releasing a statement do so. This is because of a lack of a centralised Government register for the statements, as well as there being no consequences for companies that fail to comply.

A central registry maintained by the Home Office would provide an easy place for all businesses to file their statements, send a clear signal to the private sector that it is a legal requirement, and enable the public to quickly and easily find out which companies have complied with the Act and are acting responsibly.\nA further issue is that of those companies that do release a statement, many are not of a good quality and miss out on key information. Despite the level of detail on what to include in a statement, many organisations fall short of the minimum suggested standards. The Companies Act 2006 requires that UK listed companies include non-financial information in a strategic report to “the extent necessary for an understanding of the development, performance, or positions of the company’s business”.

Expanding this requirement to include modern slavery would ensure companies identify and address this issue within their supply chains in a more comprehensive way as these reports are audited and have penalties for non-compliance.

The likelihood of modern slavery occurring in supply chains is high. The Modern Slavery Act has gone some way in getting businesses to take seriously this crime in their supply chains however changes can be made to improve the legislation and help more victims.
