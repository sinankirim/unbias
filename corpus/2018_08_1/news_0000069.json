Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email\nThe Bank of England is tipped to increase interest rates by 0.25 per cent in an announcement at 12pm today - which would be bad news for borrowers.\nIt may mean a short-term boost for holidaymakers if the move strengthens the pound, possibly meaning you can get a better deal on your holiday cash.\nAnd while it could be good news for savers, with more money if interest rates are increased on your account, experts don't believe the benefits will be passed to the 45 million customers with savings. Read More Bank of England set to raise interest rates\nAfter the November rise most banks were slow to pass on any interest increase to savers, and when they did it was a fraction of the Bank of England increase.\nIf you are one of the three and a half million people with a tracker or variable mortgage, you are likely to see an almost immediate increase in your monthly payments - on average around £400 a year.\nIf you are on a fixed-rate mortgage, your payments will be higher when the term ends. Read More Plymouth top for having the most people who can't pay their debts\nMark Harris of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients told The Mirror: “Mortgage lenders are usually quick to pass on any increase in base rate so if you are on your lender’s standard variable rate, a discounted-variable rate or base-rate tracker, then you will see an increase in your monthly mortgage payments,” warned\nCredit experts Experian say a 0.25% rise would mean a typical borrower on a standard variable rate or tracker mortgage would be forced to find around £400 a year extra.\nThat’s based on a typical standard variable rate deal of 3.99% or a tracker mortgage 2% above base rate on a 20-year mortgage worth £250,000. How to protect yourself\nOne solution is to switch to a fixed rate mortgage and take advantage of deals at present of less than 2%.\nBut if the expected increase proves difficult to manage, you should talk to your lender, advised Hannah Maundrell of money.co.uk .

Will a rate hike help the struggling pound?\n“Disappointingly for summer holidaymakers, a rate hike is not likely to make a substantial difference when they come to buy their holiday money,” said Phil McHugh of Currencies Direct.

Because competition in the savings market is being driven by small and new banks and a base rate change is unlikely to make much difference to that.
