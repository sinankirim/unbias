Marlon still has to agree to the move, but if it goes through, Sassuolo would pay 12 million euro.\nSassuolo are said to have been the team that pushed hardest for the youngster, who also had offers from Galatasaray and Schalke 04 . Because of La Liga’s rule that allows only three non-EU spots for each team, Marlon’s situation had become untenable. The Brazilian would be the fourth in the non-EU pecking order after Arthur, Malcom, and Arturo Vidal . 07:36 Mark Douglas Jacob Murphy: Strange to take on my brother\nGood piece in the Daily Star on Jacob Murphy facing the prospect of playing against twin Josh on Saturday:\nThe family will be torn. They have the Newcastle loyalty as fans, but also the son loyalty.\nThey will both want us to have a good game and the best team to win. I want a Murphy goal and a Newcastle win. We’ve never had a rivalry. We just support and help each other. We’d boost each other up if one wasn’t doing as well. We were there for each other.\nAt Norwich we looked after each other. I find it strange how other siblings are so competitive because me and my brother are not against each other. 07:34 Justin Barnes in New York\nJustin Barnes’ new role in New York revealed: Post brexit changes. . .\nThere’s a few changes to come with regards transfers and work permits - click here for more .
