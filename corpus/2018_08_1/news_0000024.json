We were delighted when this invaluable work was recognised with a national award late last year.\n“Since the project started over eight years ago, the number of people self-employed in the borough has risen dramatically - from 5,800 to 13,200 - which is significantly above the regional average.\n“With this funding, we’ll be able to help even more self-employed people and start-up businesses to grow and prosper.”\nThe Business Factory started in 2009 and offers new businesses support, social enterprises, business planning, innovation and specialist consultancy.
