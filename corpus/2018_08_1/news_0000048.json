Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email\nNewcastle United would have been able to sign Marlon Santos this summer, had work-permit proposals put forward by the Premier League for post-Brexit already been in place.\nRafa Benitez identified the Barcelona defender - who is now wanted by clubs in Germany and Italy - as a potential replacement for Florian Lejeune, who is out for the majority of the season with knee-ligament damage.\nA £1.5million loan deal for the 22-year-old centre-back was even agreed in principle, only for the transfer to fall through due to the fact Marlon did not automatically meet the criteria for being awarded a work permit.\nThe Brazilian has yet to earn a senior cap and, given he was not guaranteed to earn more than the average Premier League wage and was not going to be an automatic starter for United, the Football Association (FA) would not hand United their Governing Body Endorsement (GBE) - something which is effectively the FA’s approval for an overseas player outside of the European Union being qualified to work in this country.\nA GBE is awarded on a points-based system, which includes criteria such as transfer fee, international caps, wages and their country’s FIFA ranking.\nNewcastle did sign four players from outside the EU, but two of those - Ki Sung-yueng and Kenedy - already had British work permits, while Federico Fernandez has both an Argentine and an Italian passport.\nYoshinori Muto, meanwhile, only completed his £9.5m move from Mainz once Newcastle received a GBE from the FA - with the Japan international failing to automatically meet the selection criteria.

Read More How Premier League transfer deadline day could move again, with some clubs unhappy with early finish\nEssentially the Premier League want the GBE system to be abandoned and for top-flight footballers to be handed what would essentially be an automatic visa for any player who has been awarded a contract and a place in the squad by a Premier League club.\nAccording to The Times, the Premier League and the FA are still “poles apart” on how work permits should be awarded post-Brexit.
