What Sir Peter Soulsby says\nCity Mayor, Sir Peter Soulsby , has said it’s difficult to come up with a plan when the exit strategy remains uncertain.\nHe said: “Like the rest of the country we haven’t got a clue what we’re planning for and we can’t plan if we don’t know what we’re planning for.\n“There are so many exit strategies being discussed where would we start?\n“It’s an ever changing situation and it’s getting dangerously close.\n“It’s looking frighteningly like we’ll just crash out.”\nLater this month the government is planning to issue 70 technical notices advising businesses and consumers on how to prepare for a ‘no deal’.

The post-Brexit relationship would be governed by basic rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO).\nAs it stands, no other major trading partner of the EU trades with it on WTO terms alone. Problems and delays at ports could lead to issues with importing goods like foods and medicines. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said that the NHS is stockpiling medicines in case a deal isn’t made.
