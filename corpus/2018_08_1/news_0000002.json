This will enable the company to establish it as a new solution for multiple sectors across the country and further afield.\n“While it is visually impressive as part of an art installation or public realm development, it offers benefits in areas such as road safety and provides an alternative signage option, particularly in locations where there is no power available.”\nHe added: “As an SME it’s really important to ensure that we can invest in the future of the company without taking our focus and resources away from our existing operations. The support we have received from RG to secure the tax relief was essential during the research and development stage of the project as was the advice and guidance its team have given to our business.” Read More Chamber urges North East businesses to give Brexit feedback in new survey\nChris Robson, managing partner at RG, added: “R&D tax relief and tax credits are a beneficial way to enable SMEs to develop new products and innovations that can secure the future of their businesses and remain ahead of the curve in competitive markets.\n“Bespoke Concrete Products is a great example of the creative, manufacturing-based businesses that have given the North East its industrial credentials for generations and will ensure the region continues to be at the forefront of innovation for many years to come.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": ["https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/nechronicle/subscriptions/&quot;}"], "published": "2018-07-30T17:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-08-01T04:37:27.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
