Read More \nIt's a tumultuous time for lovers of sweet treats, who have had to endure the shrinking of some of their favourite chocolate bars in recent months. \nAnd it's bad news if you're a fan of a certain orange-flavoured snack. \nJaffa Cakes have shrunk in size by a sixth without a fall in price, reports The Mirror . You'll now get fewer Jaffa Cakes in a packet (Image: PA) \nLuckily, it's not the Jaffa Cakes themselves - which are definitely not biscuits - that have scaled down, but the packets. \nManufacturers McVitie's has cut the number supplied from 12, to 10. \nThis means that a standard box now contains 122g of treats, rather than 146.4g.

They were previously priced at £1.15.
