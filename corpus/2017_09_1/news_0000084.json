The pitiful pay rises being talked about for only some public sector workers coincide with the highest inflation for years, nudging 3%. \nAnyone who travelled abroad this summer, or any business that buys in dollars or euros, will know the reason for this – the biggest fall in the value of sterling since 1949. We’ve all been paying the price for this Government’s foolish pursuit of a damaging hard Brexit, but public sector workers have been paying it most of all. \nThe Parliamentary summer recess has seen two important and welcome developments on Brexit. \nFirstly, the Government finally admitted there will have to be a fairly lengthy transition period if or when we leave the EU, to avoid the damage of a cliff-edge Brexit. Read More \nThis is something business, trade unions and the Labour Party had been advocating for some time. Given the 15 months Mrs May has already wasted since the Referendum, there was no chance of getting everything resolved in the short time left before the March 2019 deadline. \nSecondly, Labour’s front bench now agrees we should stay in the Single Market and Customs Union during this transition and, possibly, beyond. This is a significant and welcome shift in my Party’s position. It is not only the right policy, but also one supported by most of the public, business and the unions. \nThat’s the good news. \nThe bad news is that the Government has embarked on the biggest power grab against Parliament since Henry VIII. Because Mrs May is insisting on transferring current EU laws and regulations into UK law before we know even the outline of any Brexit deal, Ministers are trying to take unprecedented powers to change laws by edict afterwards. Read More \nEverything that affects how we live our lives from our rights at work to environmental protections would be able to be changed by Ministerial diktat without reference to Parliament. \nSo much for taking back control. So much for restoring the primacy of our elected legislature. \nLabour rightly and sensibly voted against this constitutional outrage this week. The Government’s Bill survived its first stage, but will enter choppier waters when it is considered in detail in October. Conservative MPs having already tabled numerous amendments, which are likely to attract cross Party support. \nAt the moment, for example, any UK citizen can take our Government to court for breaking the law, as has happened recently over Britain’s persistent and long-standing breach of air quality standards. Read More \nAir pollution is our single biggest avoidable killer after smoking. Under the Government’s current Brexit plans, there would be nowhere for a UK citizen to appeal to and no body to enforce the law to ensure the Government complies with it. \nSo the rights we all currently enjoy would be subject to abolition by Ministerial whim and unenforceable against a capricious Government, unaccountable to our courts or Parliament. \nNo self-respecting democrat should support this.
