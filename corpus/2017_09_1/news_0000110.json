Gary Streeter \n\"We have 17 local authorities working closely together on this plan with our other partners,\" he added in a statement. \nBut hot on the heels on the press release came a strong response from Cllr Edwards. \nHe said: “Mr Hart went to this meeting without my knowledge. I would be interested in knowing if any other district councils took part or knew about it. \n\"He met me the day before and didn't feel the need to mention it, let alone say he intended to indicate we were all signed up. I don't have that mandate from my council - and he certainly doesn't. \n“We agree there is a need to go to Government and to unlock funding. We have been eager to see this happen and to see what is on offer. \"But we don’t agree that you should be offering up a new combined authority for Devon and Somerset blindly without knowing what any deal is. Councils could be giving up all their powers - without knowing that the prize is. \"Exeter has a strong economic agenda - it would be madness to jeopardise that without knowing what any benefits could be - or even if there are any benefits. “My council's position is that we could welcome devolution – but only once you know what any benefits are.” Read More Council announces overhaul after investigation reveals why thousands of votes went missing in General Election \nMr Streeter, MP for South West Devon, told Devonlive.com that there had been no snub and said \"none of the districts\" had been invited. \n\"I invited the county and unitary councils,\" he added. \"It was just a meeting to find out where we are in the devolution process with ministers, post election, with councils to report back. \n\"It was a lively successful meeting - the others will find out next week when a full report is made.\" \nAsked if Cllr Edwards, a longstanding councillor and city leader since 2010, was right to feel aggrieved, Mr Streeter added: \"I don't know him but I am sure he is a wonderful person. \n\"We don't have dealings with Exeter or North Devon - it is very parochial. I don't know who this gentleman is but once he gets the full story he's going to be very pleased.\" Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now \nThe South West currently receives only about 90 per cent of the public spending that goes into other regions and some areas, such as Torridge, Torbay and Newton Abbot, have some of the lowest earnings in the country. \nAlongside the skills agenda, the partnership is also focused on improving road and rail links to the South West and creating more housing for local people.Announcing the deal, Mr Hart said he recognised that the Government was currently focusing attention on the Brexit negotiations but he wanted to get devolution back firmly on the agenda. \n“I do not want our very strong bid for greater autonomy to get bogged down in Brexit,” he said.

Mr Hart continued: “We have 17 local authorities working closely together on this plan with our other partners. “We have worked together as a team in producing the productivity plan and we have the united will to get on and succeed. “We’re not holding out a begging bowl. The £30 million a year for 30 years that we could receive is a useful sum of money but ultimately we want the powers to get on and do what needs to be done so that the people of our region can get better jobs and have a better life in a thriving economy.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-09-15T17:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-09-15T17:54:31.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
