Ben Bradshaw, former Culture Secretary \nMr Bradshaw says Conservatives should put part allegiances aside to protect democracy. \nHe told Devonlive.com: “I hope very much that given the strong criticism by a lot of Conservative MPs of this power grab by the Government that they will work with Labour and other opposition parties in parliament but I fear they won’t. \n“Brexit was supposed to be about bringing power back to parliament but this bill constitutes the biggest power grab by the executive and the diminution of parliament since Henry VIII and should be opposed by all democrats. \n“If the Tories don’t break ranks tonight I hope very much they will support amendments to improve the bill and ensure that our elected parliament is at the centre of discussions and decision making on one of the most important issues our country has faced for 50 years.” \nLabour will vote against the legislation, arguing so-called “Henry VIII” powers in the Bill allowing ministers to alter laws without full parliamentary scrutiny.
