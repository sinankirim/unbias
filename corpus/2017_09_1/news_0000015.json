David Davies, Brexit Secretary \nJeremy Corbyn has ordered Labour MPs to vote against second reading on Monday, and other parties have tabled “reasoned amendments”. \nDavid Davis has accused Labour of adopting a “cynical and unprincipled” position, adding that Britons “will not forgive them” if they attempt to “delay or destroy” the process of leaving the EU.

It will mean me being at Westminster more over the next few months than in recent years.” \nBy long-standing custom, MPs who chair bills cannot vote on any part of the bill, or speak on it.
