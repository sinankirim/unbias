(Image: Ian Rutherford) \nEmpty first class seats on selected Virgin Trains East Coast services are being auctioned through a smartphone app shortly before departure. \nPrices start from £5 for a seat in first class carriages featuring complimentary food and drink, free wi-fi, reclining leather seats and extra legroom. \nUpgrades are initially available on some weekday services from London King’s Cross to Edinburgh, Leeds, Newcastle and York, with more routes expected to be added shortly. \nRegular walk-up first class fares for London to Edinburgh journeys can cost almost £90 more than standard class tickets. \nEach auction opens approximately two-and-a-half hours in advance and closes around half an hour before the train departs. \nSuzanne Donnelly, commercial director at Virgin Trains East Coast, said: \n“We are really excited to be partnering with Seatfrog to offer customers more opportunities to experience first class. \n“Passengers can get upgrades from as little as £5 and there are real deals to be had. \n“The live bidding element means you can decide at the last minute if you fancy treating yourself.” Benwell KEY EVENT Police swoop to arrest 'armed' man \nArmed police swooped to arrest a man suspected of illegally having a gun in the west end of Newcastle on Tuesday night. \nMore than a dozen officers were seen in the Benwell area of the city, responding to reports of a man with a firearm. \nA 35-year-old man was arrested, according to Northumbria Police. \nA spokesman for the force said: \n“At around 6.20pm last night police received intelligence that a man may be in possession of an illegal firearm in the west end of Newcastle. \n“Officers responded and a 35-year-old man was arrested. \n“He remains in police custody at this time.” Politics Is Brexit going horribly wrong? \nIs Brexit going horribly wrong? \nIt looks like it may well be.
