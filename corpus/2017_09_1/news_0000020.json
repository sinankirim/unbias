Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn (Image: PA) \nMr Corbyn ordered his MPs to vote against the Bill. Labour says it backs Brexit, following the 2016 EU referendum, but is worried because the Bill gives Government Ministers the power to change some laws without consulting Parliament. \nHowever, a total of seven Labour MPs rebelled against the leadership. They included Yorkshire MP Dennis Skinner who, like Mr Campbell, is on the left of the party and has been a consistent critic of the European Union. \nOthers were on the right of the party, including MPs Frank Field and Kate Hoey.

But Tories voted for it, and none of them voted against. \nSome Tories will try to make changes to the Bill when it returns to the House of Commons for more debates in the future. \nLiberal Democrats voted against the Bill. So did the SNP, Welsh party Plaid Cymru and the one Green MP. \nMr Campbell pointed out that he voted for an amendment proposed by Mr Corbyn criticising the Bill, but when that fell he voted in favour of the legislation. Ronnie Campbell MP (Image: Newcastle Chronicle) \nHe said: “I am a leaver, and I always have been. MPs are elected unlike the EU bureaucrats, and if people don’t like how MPs vote then they can get rid of us and that’s how it should work.” \nThe European Union (Withdrawal Bill) prevents EU institutions from having any authority in the UK after Brexit. \nIt means EU laws can no longer be enforced here, but it also makes existing EU laws part of UK law. \nThe Government says this is necessary because otherwise there would suddenly be huge gaps in UK law on the day that Brexit takes place. For example, some regulations which affect workers’ rights or consumer protection come from the EU. \nLabour and some Conservative MPs say they are concerned because the Bill also gives Government Ministers the power to change EU laws as they are incorporated into UK law - without consulting Parliament. \nSpeaking in the House of Commons, City of Durham MP Roberta Blackman-Woods said she was voting against the Bill because it was “profoundly undemocratic”. \nShe said: “Not only does the Bill give far-reaching powers to Ministers without meaningful parliamentary scrutiny, but it allows for rights and protections to be reduced or removed through secondary legislation without any meaningful scrutiny.” \nPrime Minister Theresa May is now facing a titanic battle over her flagship Brexit bill, after scores of amendments were tabled. \nA total of 157 amendments to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill, covering 59 pages, were published, including many from senior Conservative europhiles. \nA raft of changes proposed by Tories including former ministers Kenneth Clarke, Dominic Grieve, Nicky Morgan and Anna Soubry, serves notice on the Prime Minister that she faces a rough ride in the remaining stages of the Bill’s passage through Parliament. \nLabour has also tabled a raft of amendments designed to curb the Government’s use of so-called Henry VIII powers that allow reforms to be passed with little parliamentary scrutiny. \nIt also wants to secure protections on human rights and environmental standards.
