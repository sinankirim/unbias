Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThis is a truly exciting time for people working in the British automotive industry. UK car manufacturing output in 2017 reached new heights and was the strongest for almost two decades. \nIn March this year, British car production rose by 7.3 per cent, the highest upturn since the turn of the century, thanks to demand and investment from overseas. \nMoreover, recent years have seen many companies reshoring their engineering operations to the UK. \nThis has had a knock-on effect of increasing investment and production by original equipment manufacturers. \nThe impact on skills demand in the automotive industry is clear, with increased career opportunities for automotive engineers across the country, including the North East. \nYet industry growth is bringing with it huge challenges, with increasing consumer demand and changing technology putting considerable strain on an industry which is already struggling to fill vacancies. \nOf the 170,691 cars produced in the UK in March, more than 130,000 were exported. \nFigures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) show that 1.7 million cars were produced in 2016. \nBy 2020 this figure could surpass two million, increasing the need for skilled engineers to meet demand. \nThere are other factors placing pressure on skills. We are seeing a major growth in electric vehicles, thanks to the announcement by the UK government that diesel and petrol engines will be phased out in the coming years. \nThere is also Brexit. Whether you agree with our decision to leave the EU or not, the fact is that this is a decision which will have an impact on skills in the UK. \nPut simply, it will be harder for young people from the EU to head into the UK to find work, and this will ultimately hit all sectors, including automotive. \nAll in all, this points to a challenging picture for the region’s automotive sector, even if this is a nice challenge to have. ElringKlinger GB managing director Ian Malcolm with a group of the company’s apprentices at the Redcar plant \nBut how are businesses navigating this complex picture? I caught up with a number of local automotive industry suppliers to find out. \nRyan Maughan is managing director of AVID Technology Group in Cramlington. AVID is heavily involved in advancing the electric and hybrid vehicle industry, a market which as alluded to earlier, is experiencing rapid growth. \nIt will come as no great surprise to learn that AVID has more than doubled in size in the last 18 months, and is now employing 60 people. \nMaughan says the growth in headcount is set to continue. \nHe said: “We have invested over £1m in the expansion of our manufacturing capabilities and are actively seeking to expand our team with new opportunities in mechanical and electronic engineering, embedded software, sales and marketing, production and other support functions within the business. \n“As vehicle manufacturers move to electrified drive trains to reduce CO2 emissions and improve air quality AVID is well positioned to capitalise on this rapid growth in the market. \n“We are seeing new demand for our proprietary high-performance electronics and motor technology in other rapidly growing markets such as robotics. \n“The automotive industry is changing and the skills that will be required will change too. \n“There will be a far greater need for power electronics, embedded systems and any professional engineering function to meet industry demands for professional engineers to design components and systems for vehicles. \n“There will also be a greater need for those who can set-up and maintain robotic assembly and production equipment as car manufacturing plants move from manual assembly methods to leaner more automated methods.” \nSo what is the best route for those looking to get into organisations such as AVID? \nThe good news for those reading is that there is a range of entry routes – and all offer long-term career advancement opportunities. \nMaughan adds: “University is a good path for many and people should not be necessarily put off by the costs. \n“There is support available to students and there are often sponsorships in engineering.

We have plans to significantly expand what we currently offer in the coming year. \n“We will be establishing our own in-house technical academy to take recruits from school leaver to professional engineer specialising in electronics, embedded systems and robotics and also covering other engineering disciplines. \n“Any young person looking to work in the automotive industry and with an interest in maths and sciences would be well advised to consider the possibilities in engineering.” \nAnother regional business successfully wrestling with the skills challenge is ElringKlinger GB Ltd, a subsidiary of the multinational company, ElringKlinger AG, sited in Teesside. \nExperts in the design and manufacture of speciality gaskets, the company also produces sealing solutions for engine, transmission and exhaust applications, as well as manufacturing heat shields both for engine bay and under body. \nThese are prosperous times as in summer, the company announced it had won a £12m-per-year contract with Jaguar Land Rover. \nThe Redcar-based business employs more than 300 people at its Kirkleatham Business Park base and has been chosen by Jaguar to supply 36 heat shield and gasket components for its Engine Manufacturing Centre in Wolverhampton. \nElringKlinger said it is planning to take on another 30 operatives this year, on the back of a huge increase in sales. Apprenticeships form a crucial strand of ElringKlinger’s approach. \nThe company’s managing director Ian Malcolm said: “September has seen a number of apprentices move into permanent roles at the site, leaving 18 apprentices at the ElringKlinger HQ in Redcar. \n“The next intake will see more apprentices begin their journey with ElringKlinger in 2018. \n“ElringKlinger offers a wide range of apprenticeship schemes which cover production, administration and engineering. \n“Apprentices start a four or five-year programme at Middlesbrough College’s STEM Centre, where they are taught by tutors from industry backgrounds. \n“They move onto placements at ElringKlinger’s Redcar facility, and then full-time roles in disciplines such as multi-skilled maintenance, tool room, computer-aided design and production engineering. \n“Apprentices often get the opportunity to work at the firm’s headquarters in Germany where they experience many different parts of the global business. \n“The apprentices work across a number of roles and gain valuable hands on practical experience alongside classroom learning.” \nBut why does the business invest so heavily in apprentices? The key here is longevity – this is a business which is investing for the future, seeing huge opportunities for expansion. \nIt doesn’t want to get caught short and left with skills gaps as it fulfils its long-term growth strategy. \nInvesting and developing from within offers a much more cost-effective route than continually hiring externally – potentially at great expense – to plug skills gaps. \nMalcolm explained: “ElringKlinger has found the apprenticeship route to be an efficient way of bridging the region’s skills gap internally, ensuring the company has the right people and skills required for the growing industry. \n“ElringKlinger has a long-running commitment to engineering the workforce of tomorrow and currently employs 18 apprentices. \n“The company also has close links with local education providers, including Teesside University, Middlesbrough College and Hartlepool College of Further Education. \n“The company is proud to be doing its bit to help encourage more people into the industry in the North East.” \nTo gain an alternative perspective on the skills issue facing the region’s automotive sector I spoke to John McCullagh, managing director at Stokesley-based MSS People. \nThe company has specific experience of recruiting within the automotive sector and has watched with great interest as the industry has grown in recent years, and the recruitment challenges this has brought. \nMcCullagh says: “Whenever the subject of recruitment within the automotive sector is discussed, talk of skills shortages invariably enters the conversation. \n“It also tends to err towards the negative too, yet the automotive sector throughout the North East has much to celebrate. In fact, it is relatively booming. \n“Nissan’s reaffirmed commitment to the region is just one example and, along with the likes of Jaguar Land Rover and Ford, are putting the region at the forefront of some of the most innovative and exciting technological and engineering developments taking place today: think electric vehicles and hydrogen tech initiatives. \n“Of course, we cannot dismiss the fact that there is the challenge of how to overcome the skills shortages within the sector, but great strides are being made in this area. \nKey for McCullagh in recent years is the level of joined-up thinking we are seeing within the region’s automotive industry. The industry needs more young people. \nYet many young people are being tempted by so-called sexier industries, such as creative and media. \nThere is a battle for talent on, which is not helped by perceptions that manufacturing is a thing of the past. \nChallenging perceptions and winning young hearts and minds is key. \nThankfully, the industry’s key players are working as one to win the battle for future talent. \nMcCullagh adds: “The decline in manufacturing is nothing new, it has been happening for decades. \n“This has discouraged many young people from realising that career opportunities do exist within the sector and prompted them to seek a career elsewhere. \n“What is new is the way in which the industry itself is now working hard on challenging perceptions, and preparing the talent pipeline for the next generation of workers. \n“For instance, there are initiatives where OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers are working with local academia to bring people into the sector at an earlier stage while raising the profile of the automotive industry as a career of choice for younger workers at the same time.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-09-29T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-09-29T16:13:48.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
