Read More \nMr Gove, now the Secretary of State for the Environment, said: \"I think that the people of this country have had enough of experts,\" during the campaign. Michael Gove - unimpressed by experts \nSir David said: \"That is a cry from someone who doesn't understand what they are saying. \n\"That's what that means. Someone has told them something they don't like and which they probably don't understand. \n\"That's not an evil necessarily. There's quite a lot I don't understand and quite a lot of people I don't like. \n\"It is a knee-jerk thing but it doesn't bear examination for a micro-second.\" \nThe 91-year-old also admitted he himself did not understand the political and economic implications of Brexit. Read More Andrew Bridgen - 'The media is failing to report Brexit properly' \nHe said David Cameron's decision to allow the referendum was 'an abrogation of the principle of parliamentary democracy.' \nHe added: \"We didn't know the facts. I still don't know the facts. All I know is that it is much more complicated than I thought.\" \nHe said: \"Philosophically I would rather people embrace one another rather than spat in one another's eyes.\" \nSir David said internationalism was needed to tackle major issues such as climate change adding: \"We need more internationalism not less, more talking not less, more agreement not less - and less (sic) frontiers.\" \nHe added: \"Why am I going on about this? I'm not a political chap. I know about bugs.\" Read More ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-09-26T14:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-09-27T00:20:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
