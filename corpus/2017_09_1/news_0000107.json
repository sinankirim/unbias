This picture is expected to remain stable in the coming months”. \nThe EEF and BDO report concludes that this strong performance has boosted business confidence among firms in the East Midlands. \nThis in turn has increased the number of businesses in the region with recruitment plans by 30 per cent.

The organisation said while firms are confident of their own performance, EEF’s indicator for the UK economy has slipped for the second quarter running in response to the continued political uncertainty and squeeze on consumer spending. \nAs a result EEF continues to expect tepid growth of 1.7 per cent this year and 1.3 per cent in 2018.

As such, it is vital the Government sends a signal to industry and investors in the UK and overseas that it is doing everything in its power to get growth of the UK economy back on the agenda. This must include a bold and ambitious cross -government industrial strategy.” Read More Millions of pounds up for grabs for SMEs \nTom Lawton, partner and head of manufacturing at BDO in the East Midlands, said: \n“Despite the economic and political uncertainties, manufacturers’ in the East Midlands continue to be a force to be reckoned with, delivering a strong performance as well as increasing both investment and employment plans to make the most of the strengthening export opportunities available to them. \n“However, manufacturers’ confidence about the UK economy has continued to fall for the second quarter running. With growing opportunities around the world, particularly the Eurozone, manufacturers’ need stability and certainty in government policy (including Brexit) to provide the right environment for them to commit to the significant capital and research investment required to support continued growth.” Like us on Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-09-05T15:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-09-05T17:24:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
