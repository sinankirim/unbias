Labour Councillor Nick Forbes \nThe politicians aim to widen the group to include, councils, MPs, businesses and faith groups with the intention of holding its first meeting in Newcastle as the Great Exhibition for the North starts next year. \nNewcastle City Council leader Nick Forbes said he was pleased that the calls to rebalance the UK would come out of the North East.
