But this time interest was high as the party elected a new leader after their Brexit referendum success followed by an apparent falling out of favour with the electorate. Henry Bolton beat off competition from six others to become UKIP’s fifth leader in 11 months.

There were two police liaison officers on site to keep an eye on proceedings but they weren’t called in to deal with any incidents,” he said. \n“The feedback I have had from the organisers is that it has been fantastic.” \nHe said the conference was a ‘huge boost’ for the Bay and they estimated the conference had brought some £500,000 into the resort over its two days. \nThat follows the success of the Young Farmers conference in the spring which attracted some 5,000 delegates and ahead of the Rotary Club of Great Britain and Ireland national conference next spring expected to attract 1,000 delegates over three nights boosting the resort by some £750,000.

It’s fortunate for us when the weather is bad but whether it is good for the resort as a whole to have a very wet week in August is another matter. ” \nGet all the headlines, pictures, analysis, opinion and video on the stories that matter to you.
