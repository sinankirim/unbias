I thought it was best for the country to stay in the EU. \n\"I think we're going to see a turbulent few weeks until the market calms down. \n\"But it is difficult to comment on what I think will happen in terms of currency and tariffs, as it is too early to say.\" \nMike Kirsopp, chief executive at Cambridge and Counties business bank, based in New Walk, Leicester, was more optimistic. \nHe said: \"I think it was less a surprise than maybe others in my industry thought because the big sentiments for leave were in the Midlands and North where our business is focused. \n\"We prepared for both eventualities and always thought it would be close, but we are UK focused so do not have importers and exporters in volumes. \n\"We are planning for business as usual. \n\"It always feels very raw in the first wave, but we've got months and years to sort this out.\" \nHe said: \"It's going to be very good for the country to get its independence back. Europe does not particularly like us. \n\"I think we contribute more to the EU than we get back. \n\"I would say, for instance, because we are not in the monetary system we won't really lose much trade. \n\"I voted for Cameron's Government. His idea was to be in Europe, and he knew how to steer the country then, but he is not the right persons to make the right decisions now we are leaving. I want Boris to take over. I trust him.\" \nSam Suffolk, operations director at metal working business CNC Direct Engineering in Countesthorpe, supplies Caterpillar among others. \nHe said: \"We are a businesses who exports some of our products to Europe. The pound has always been a high value. \n\"Now that it is devaluing it is going to make anyone who exports competitive in the EU. \n\"While the dust settles, we have got products people want and they are not going to stop wanting products from the UK.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-06-27T12:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-06-27T12:17:16.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
