the grass is not always greener after 'Nexit' 17:30, 25 Jun 2016 Britain historically voted for 'Brexit' this week, but Newcastle United players should think twice before rushing for the St James' Park exit Shares Get Newcastle United FC news by email Ian MacNicol/Getty Images Georginio Wijnaldum (L) of Newcastle United celebrates scoring his team's first goal with his team mate Moussa Sissoko (R) \nAs the United Kingdom attempts to come to terms with the gargantuan ramifications of ‘Brexit’ from the European Union, transfer speculation continues to abound. \nSeveral Newcastle United players in particular have been linked with moves away from St James’ Park following relegation - with Moussa Sissoko and Fabricio Coloccini having made their desire to depart public. \nGeorginio Wijnaldum , Andros Townsend, Tim Krul and Daryl Janmaat are just some of the other members of the Magpies squad who are being eyed up by potential suitors. \nBut, at the end of an historic week for this country, the United players should think long and hard before pushing for what could be described as a ‘Nexit’. \nIt is understandable in many ways that international players do not want to ply their trade in the Championship but, should they decide to leave, then these Newcastle players must seriously consider the implications for their future. \nFive Magpies listed below believed the grass would be greener away from Tyneside over the past half-decade, yet it could be argued that none of them quite achieved the success they expected. \nTrue this time it is different because United have been relegated, but Sissoko, Wijnaldum et al should consider what happened to this quintet before rushing for a ‘Nexit’: Andy Carroll \nLeft for Liverpool, January 2011 \nGateshead-born Carroll had always dreamed of donning the famous Newcastle No 9 shirt but, after netting 31 times in 80 league games for United and impressing in the Premier League following the Magpies’ promotion, a move to Liverpool in January 2011 proved too tempting to turn down. \nThe Reds, in an effort to avoid appearing like a ‘selling club’ after Chelsea paid £50million for Fernando Torres, eventually agreed to stump up an astonishing £35m in order to prise the 6ft 4in striker away from St James’ Park. \nIn hindsight, Carroll may argue his career is now in a positive place; he may continue to struggle for fitness problems and is no longer an England regular, but the 27-year-old is about to ply his trade at the new-look Olympic Stadium with West Ham United. \nHowever, for at least two years after leaving Tyneside, Carroll’s career stalled. \nInjury issues, and the fact that Carroll was not a like-for-like replacement for Torres in Liverpool’s system, meant that the powerful forward struggled to impress at Anfield. \nA loan spell at West Ham brought seven goals in 24 games, but injury problems have restricted the forward to just 88 games in four years. \nMany expect Carroll to one day return to St James’ Park, but his career has proven to be a mixed bag since departing United. \nWATCH: Andy Carroll hand out food and drink to a homeless man Video loading Click to play Tap to play The Live Event you are trying to watch is either unavailable or has not started Please refresh this page in your browser to reload this live event video Jose Enrique \nLeft for Liverpool, August 2011 \nIt’s fair to say the Spaniard does not receive anything like the warm Tyneside reception his compatriot Rafa Benitez does now - in fact, the St James’ Park crowd love nothing more than booing Enrique. \nThe left-back really came into his own as a Newcastle player during the 2009/10 Championship-winning campaign, and he also impressed during the Magpies’ first season back in the top flight. \nOnce again it was Liverpool who raided Tyneside for one of the Magpies’ best players, paying £7million for the Spaniard. \nDuring his first three seasons at Anfield, Enrique averaged more than 30 league appearances per campaign, but his last three brought a combined total of just 12. \nThe 30-year-old has now been released by the Reds and, though Enrique may argue he got a couple of productive seasons out of his move, it seems to many that the left-back’s talent has been largely unfulfilled. \nAt the age of 30, Enrique’s career appears to be at a standstill. Demba Ba \nLeft for Chelsea, January 2013 Matthew Lewis/Getty Images \nOf all five former Magpies on this list, the Senegal international’s career has probably blossomed the most since leaving the North East - yet even then, it has not as progressed as Ba would necessarily have hoped. \nDuring the summer of 2011, Newcastle took a gamble on the forward following West Ham’s relegation - signing Ba on a free transfer despite concerns over his problem knee, which was described as a “ticking timebomb”. \nA return of 16 goals during his first season was impressive and Ba helped fire United to a fifth-placed finish, despite being shifted out to the right-hand side against his will in order to accommodate new signing Papiss Cisse in January 2012. \nAfter making his discontent clear to Alan Pardew , Ba was then moved back into the central striker role just a few weeks into the 2012-13 campaign, scoring 13 goals in 22 games. \nIt was Benitez who then urged Chelsea to pay Ba’s £7million buy-out clause and take the forward to Stamford Bridge in January 2013. \nBa was never able to hold down a regular starting slot with the Blues though, and managed just 14 goals in 51 games. \nA prolific spell with Turkish club Besiktas - for who he scored 27 times in 44 games - followed before Ba accepted the lure of Chinese riches to join Shanghai Greenland Shenhua. \nHe has netted 12 times in 16 games, highlighting how natural a finisher he is, but Ba’s talents could - and should - still be on show in one of Europe’s top leagues at the age of 31. Yohan Cabaye \nLeft for Paris Saint-Germain, January 2014 2014 Getty Images \nThe French international would probably argue his career has moved on from his time on Tyneside, but the midfielder’s best football did come in black and white. \nHe may have been relatively unknown in England when United enacted his £4.5m release clause during the summer of 2011, but Cabaye had just lifted the Ligue 1 title with Lille and was highly regarded in France. \nHis impact at Newcastle was immediate, with Cabaye forming a magnificent central-midfield partnership with Cheick Tiote as Alan Pardew’s United raced to a fifth-placed finish in the Premier League. \nIn all, Cabaye scored 18 goals in 93 games for the Magpies, and really helped make Newcastle tick in attack; arguably, United have failed to adequately replace him ever since. \nHaving gone on strike before a match with Manchester City in August 2013 after Newcastle rejected a £10m bid for him from Arsenal, Cabaye would then depart for Paris Saint-Germain in a £20m deal just a few months later. \nThough the midfielder won five trophies in just 18 months at the Parc des Princes, Cabaye struggled to hold down a regular first-team slot and lost his place in the France squad. \nEventually, Cabaye rejoined former boss Pardew at Crystal Palace last summer and, though he reached the FA Cup final, the 30-year-old’s form has been mixed. \nSelhurst Park is hardly the Champions League destination Cabaye expected to be playing at two-and-a-half years after leaving United - Sissoko in particular should heed this warning. Mathieu Debuchy \nLeft for Arsenal, July 2014 2013 Getty Images \nOnce Cabaye signed for Newcastle, it seemed almost inevitable that his best friend Debuchy would follow him at some point in the not-too-distant future. \nA fellow Ligue 1 winner with Lille, Debuchy eventually joined Cabaye on Tyneside in January 2012, six months after United had refused to meet the French club’s asking price. \nThe right-back helped Newcastle avoid relegation in 2012-13, before impressing during the following campaign - netting his only Magpies goal in a Tyne-Wear derby. \nA France regular while on Tyneside, a £12m move to Arsenal followed during the summer of 2014 - much to the anger of United fans. \nHe may have added an FA Cup medal to his collection at The Emirates, but Debuchy has managed just 22 appearances in two seasons due to injury problems - and then being usurped for the right-back spot by youngster Hector Bellerin. \nA loan move to Bordeaux earlier this year failed to bring the best out of Debuchy, and he missed out on France’s Euro 2016 squad. \nDebuchy’s promising career appears to have hit a roadblock just two years since leaving United.
