MPs are no better than any other member and the members have spoken, they want Jeremy as leader. \n“We are facing one of the most right wing Tory governments of our time and we should be fighting them, not each other.” \nDave Anderson MP added: “It’s not great news, they have made a mistake and are abusing the democratic process - members overwhelmingly voted for Jeremy as leader, \n“This is not the time to have a leadership challenge, we should be on focusing on what is good for the country.” \nNewcastle Central MP Chi Onwurah was more cool on Mr Corbyn’s leadership, she said: “Jeremy has a mandate from Labour Party members and he needs to tell us how we are going to win a November or December election. \n“I support the leadership of the party and I am going to listen to what he has to say. He has to be accountable to members and the country. It would be wrong to make up my mind now when I need to hear how we would win a November or December election.” \nShadow health secretary Heidi Alexander became the first of Mr Corbyn’s front bench to hand her resignation in on Sunday morning. \nIn her resignation letter, she said it was “with a heavy heart” that she decided to stand down but she does not think Mr Corbyn can lead Labour during Brexit negotiations. \nShe added: “As much as I respect you as a man of principle, I do not believe you have the capacity to shape the answers our country is demanding and I believe that if we are to form the next government, a change of leadership is essential.” \nShadow Scottish secretary Ian Murray, Shadow education secretary Lucy Powell, Shadow transport secretary Lilian Greenwood, Shadow environment secretary Kerry McCarthy, Shadow minister for young people Gloria De Piero and Shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Seema Malhotra all followed.
