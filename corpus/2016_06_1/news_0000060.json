The decision we make on June 23 is a decision for all time. And the debate we have today is a critical debate for Britain and even more so for our region.” \nStaunch Eurosceptic Sir William Cash who represents the constituency of Stone and chairs the European Scrutiny Committee, took to the stage first. \nHe argued that the European Union’s law-making was undemocratic and a single market trade left the UK out of pocket. \nHe said: “With more and more treaties, we are giving more and more power away. Laws should be made in our parliament by your elected representatives. \nThe Hilton Newcastle Gateshead hotel \n“About 55% of all our laws are made in the EU. It is an awful lot. Nearly half of those are made behind closed doors. I don’t really think it’s democratic. \n“We lost £68bn in our trade last year with the other member states. The single market is just simply not working. It will end up with a crisis. \n“The GDP of Europe is going further and further down and it’s having a severe impact on our own economy. We’re better off out.” \nIn response, Pat McFadden, MP for Wolverhampton south east, claimed that workers and businesses in the North East would be worse off under Brexit. \n“In terms of the economic argument, 58% of exports from this region go to the EU. Nissan produces more cars than the whole Italian industry. \n“If we leave it would be a hammer blow to jobs and trades like this.” \nThe debate was held on the same day The Journal revealed the results of a poll suggesting the outcome of the vote in the North East is too close to call. \nA survey of just over 500 people carried out by Hexham-based polling company Panelbase found that 50% of those likely to vote in the referendum wanted to leave the EU while 43% wanted to remain in. 2016 Getty Images The European Union and the Union flag sit together \nBut 7% of those questioned were still undecided, suggesting that both sides of the debate could still win the referendum. \nThe poll also showed that immigration is - by a small degree - the main issue likely to affect people’s votes, with 31% of those questioned highlighting that as their major concern. \nOn the subject of immigration, Mr Cash said: “There are far too many people coming in from the EU. We are a small country, we don’t have the same space as Germany and Spain. \n“Young people can’t buy houses and there is enormous pressure on health services and social services.” \nMr McFadden said: “Most immigration comes from outside the European Union. \n“I don’t believe most people come here for benefits. They pay taxes and want to so something postive for themselves and our country.” \nConservative MP Mr Cash has made headlines recently for threatening David Cameron with a vote of no confidence over the Prime Minister’s Remain campaign. \nIn an interview with the Telegraph, Mr Cash said: “My view is that they’ve been engaged in monumentally misleading propaganda…they have relentlessly and flagrantly been anything but impartial and inaccurate.” \nAt the debate, Mr Cash alluded to his party’s infighting by saying Mr Cameron’s negotiations with the European Union were not guaranteed. \nPassionate views were aired by audience members, who asked the speakers about the NHS, immigration and appealing to women voters. \nWhen asked about controlling immigration in the event of Brexit, Mr Cash said: “There is a lot of talk about an Australian points system. \n“Your members of parliament can make a decision about where those lines are drawn.” \nMr McFadden, who was sacked from the Shadow Cabinet in January by Jeremy Corbyn, said: “We should remain and play a leading role in Euope. That’s the outcome that the rest of the world wants to see. It’s in the interests of our country and in no region more than the North East.” \nDr Hari Shukli OBE attended the debate and said: “My personal view is that we should stay in. Changes should be made in Europe. Our economy is part of a global village.” \nThose surveyed in The Journal/Panelbase poll thought the country would be better able to deal with terrorism and climate change if it stayed in the union. \nBut they thought the economy, immigration and the refugee crisis would be better handled if the country voted to go it alone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-06-03T19:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-06-03T20:58:41.794+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
