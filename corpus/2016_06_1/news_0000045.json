Newcastle and Durham Universities alone have benefitted from over £50m of EU funding since 2008. \nThe statement came in a joint letter from Shirley Atkinson, vice-chancellor and chief executive of the University of Sunderland ; Professor Chris Brink, vice-chancellor of Newcastle University; Professor Stuart Corbridge, vice-chancellor and warden of Durham University; Professor Paul Croney, vice-chancellor and chief executive of Teesside University; and Professor Andrew Wathey, vice-chancellor and chief executive of Northumbria University . \nThey said: “For us the health of higher education is a natural concern, and we believe that EU membership brings benefit to the world-leading excellence of the UK’s universities, including those in the region. \n“The region’s universities have always been international, and they collaborate internationally. \n“They are also major employers. In a recent poll, nearly 90% of those working in UK higher education said they will vote to remain in the EU referendum.” \nStudents outside Northumbria University \nThe university leaders added: “The UK’s membership of the EU supports the employment and career prospects of our graduates: study abroad programmes, many in EU countries, help graduates get better jobs. \n“EU membership also benefits the strength and dynamism of UK research and innovation, which drives prosperity and reputation.” \nAnd they urged: “For all these reasons we believe that remaining in the EU would be the better option for the North East and for the wider United Kingdom.” \nThe letter’s authors said they were writing in a personal capacity rather than on behalf of the institutions they oversee. \nLabour North East MEP Jude Kirton-Darling welcomed the statement, saying: “EU funding going into our universities has changed the lives of thousands of students, and allowed hundreds more the chance to study abroad, something out of the reach of many of our young people without financial support.” \nAnd North East MEP Paul Brannen, also Labour, added: “The North East is a world leader in science and technology research, and to cut ourselves off from a significant source of funding would be ridiculous.” \nThe EU referendum campaign continues on Tuesday with a high-profile TV debate. Those taking part include London mayor Sadiq Khan, who will speak on behalf of the ‘remain’ campaign, and former London mayor Boris Johnson, one of the leaders of the “leave” campaign. \nBookmakers revealed £40.5m has been gambled on the outcome of the EU referendum - making it the biggest political betting event in British history, beating the Scottish independence referendum. \nBookmakers said the frenzy of excitement over the looming vote has prompted some people to place bets for the first time. \nWith just days to go until the vote, betting has swung behind ‘remain’. \nWilliam Hill on Monday cut their odds for ‘remain’ twice, as they went from 4/11 to 1/3 and then to 2/7 (a 77% chance), while ‘leave’ was lengthened twice, from 11/5 to 9/4, then to 13/5 (a 27% chance). \nBetfair also placed the odds for ‘remain’ at 2/7 - the best since May - while Brexit odds have drifted to 7/2, equating to a 22% chance. \nBetfair spokeswoman Naomi Totten said: “This market continues to mimic the pattern of the Scottish referendum, where historical confidence in the eventual ‘no’ vote slipped slightly ten days before referendum day only to resettle in the week of the vote.” The European Union debate ", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-06-21T08:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-06-21T08:12:34.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
