What is an MEP? \nA MEP is someone who has been elected to serve as a popular representative in the European Parliament. \nThey have the power to approve, amend or reject nearly all EU legislation. There are 751 MEPs and 73 represent the UK. Who are the MEPs for the North East? Jonathan Arnott MEP \nThey are Labour MEPs Jude Kirton-Darling, and Paul Brannen, along with UKIP MEP Jonathan Arnott. \nBoth Labour MEPs campaigned for Britain to stay in the EU, claiming the North East benefited more than any other region from European funding. \nBut pro Brexit Mr Arnott called for Britain to leave because the UK had “a 100% record of failure” in trying to change EU laws. What does leaving the EU mean for our MEPs? \nNobody knows. There is not a timeline in place for when Britain will leave the union so we don’t know when the MEPs will be heading home. \nThe next MEP elections are due place in 2019 and there has been no official word on whether Britain’s representatives will depart before then. \nFor now, the UK’s MEPs aren’t going anywhere as they are still elected officials with a job to do. How have the MEPs for the North East reacted to voters choosing Brexit? Paul Brannen \nMr Arnott described the decision as a “tremendous day for Britain and for our democratic process”. \nHe said: “The people of the North East have led the way in voting clearly for Brexit. \n“The British people as a whole have spoken and we have regained control over our own destiny. \n“Now the hard work begins. We must now deal with our European colleagues as friends and neighbours and negotiate a deal for the future which allows us to trade freely with the EU, control our borders and work together for our mutual benefit.” \nHowever, Mr Brannen tweeted: “The people have spoken. The turmoil begins. The poor will suffer. The rich will be fine. The country is reduced.” \nMrs Kirton-Darling said she was “pretty broken-hearted” Britain had voted to leave. \nShe tweeted: “That’s democracy. People are very angry and divided. We need to find a way to deal with it.” More on the EU Referendum", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-06-24T19:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-06-24T19:53:22.197+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
