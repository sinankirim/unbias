Shares Comments Get daily news by email Nigel Farage, leader of UKIP and Vote Leave campaigner, talks to the media after registering his vote in the UK's EU referendum, at his local polling station Cudham Church of England Primary School on June 23, 2016 in Westerham, England \nThere’s been a lot of speculation about what could happen to people from European Union countries currently living in the UK, if we vote ‘Leave’ in the EU referendum . \nBut how much of what’s been said is accurate, and what is simple scaremongering? \nWe take a brief look at the issue. What is the current situation? \nAt the moment, almost anyone from any EU country has the right to come and work in the UK. \nOf course, it works both ways. Brits can also go and work in EU countries.

It’s just one of many scare stories put out by campaigners - on both sides of the argument - in the EU referendum campaign. What would a Leave vote mean? \nQuitting the EU would allow a British Government to impose controls on immigration from EU countries. \nBut it wouldn’t force us to do that. It would simply give us the choice. \nAnd it certainly wouldn’t force any Government to deport people who are already here. So would foreign nationals be kicked out? \nPeople from EU countries who are living and working in the UK came here legally, under the rules that existed when they arrived. They wouldn’t have to leave. \nNo Government is going to tell British businesses who currently have staff from other parts of the Europe that they have to lose their staff. \nMP Gisela Stuart, chair of the Leave campaign and herself a migrant from Germany, points out that the Leave campaign has never talked about deporting people. \nSo everyone can relax - there’s no need to pack a suitcase just yet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-06-23T14:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-06-23T15:17:18.346+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
