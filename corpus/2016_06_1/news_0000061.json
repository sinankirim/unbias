If I muck it up, I muck it up. To me, I’m talking to you in your kitchen’ By Leicester Mercury | Posted: June 05, 2016 BBC Country life: Radio broadcaster and TV presenter Charlotte Smith 'Radio is so immediate. If I muck it up, I muck it up. To me, I'm talking to you... X \nCopy link to paste in your message / Comments (0) \nCharlotte Smith, Quorn-born presenter of Radio 4's Farming Today programme and Countryfile, tells Sarah Staples why she's got the best job, why she doesn't begrudge expensive wellies... and why her kids won't be leaving home until they can cook \nIt was on a family holiday in Devon and she was having a dip in the sea, when she spotted her toddler wobbling down the beach, heading for the water. \"I was shouting, bellowing, at her not to come in.'' \nThe woman swimming next to me recognised my voice and said: \"You're Charlotte Smith, aren't you?' \"I thought: 'Oh please God, I wasn't swearing, was I?'.\" \nMost mums – strike that – any mum reading this will recognise stories of yelling at a wayward toddler. But most (and we thank our lucky stars for this) haven't got a voice recognisable from BBC Radio 4. \nOut of the sea, and back in her wellies, you might know her face from BBC One's Sunday night sheep-and-slippers ratings favourite, Countryfile.But all of this is just a stack of beans. In terms of career highs – at least when it comes to her mum, Jan – last December she turned on the Christmas lights in Quorn, the village where she was born. \n\"I think I've finally made her proud,\" she reckons. The thumbnail photo of her in our sister paper, The Loughborough Echo, we tell her, makes her look, ahem, windswept. \n\"It rained,\" she confirms with an earthy chuckle. It is the laugh, reader, of a woman you could go to the pub with. What more do you need to know? In the space of a two-hour interviewing romp (for us at any rate; she's got work to do), we cover everything from the Common Agricultural Policy to the price of wellies – £90 on her last pair, essential in her line of work – and the joys and pitfalls of older parenting (she had her first child at 40, her second at 42). \nThat's a lot of ground covered. And yet before we even begin, we get a quick insight into daily life behind the microphone, watching her record a Q&A for Radio 4's Gardener's Question Time about, of all things, glyphosate, a weedkiller, huddled round a windswept corner of BBC Broadcasting House with presenter Peter Gibbs. \nShe answers Gibbs's questions, navigating the twists and turns of the European Commission's will it/won't it be banned decision, unravelling the complex story in authoritative, mid-counties English. She has a script, which she writes herself, but in this game, if you don't have the answers, there is nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. \nFrankly, those 10 minutes reminds us of those nightmares where you're on a stage naked and expected to recite the manual for your cooker. In German. All delivered in calm, cheerful head-girl voice that if it were to tell you to jump off a cliff, you would, whistling a hornpipe, all the time thinking she knew best. \nNow that's what you pay your licence fee for. \n\"Radio is so immediate,\" she says later, when we point this out. \"If I muck it up, I muck it up. To me, I'm talking to you in your kitchen.\"I have one talent in life. I can talk. I've pushed it to the max.\" \nRecording with Gibbs over, electric blue baseball jacket dumped back in the newsroom (you didn't expect a BBC presenter to wear that now, did you? Or the Converse pumps), we move to an open space akin to a sixth form common room, deep in the bowels of the beeb, with a mug of tea. \nThese days, you'll hear Charlotte on Radio 4's Farming Today programme. Now you might expect that regular listeners to Farming Today would be, well, farmers. It's a fair assumption. But no, it turns out that many of the one million who tune in (yes, one million. Who knew?) from 5.45am to 5.58am, Mondays to Fridays, are, well, anything but. \n\"There are not many farmers, although it's certainly listened to by industry people. A lot of older people, who wake up early, listen. And loads with young kids. I can't tell you the number of times other mums tell me: 'I just woke up to hear you on the radio'. Commuters, too.\" \nThe programme has been on air since 1960. In the days leading up to this interview, it has covered Brexit, Chelsea Flower Show trends, antibiotic resistance and reducing methane from cattle. There was a time when, given the falling number of agricultural workers in an increasingly automated countryside, there was talk of axing it. \n\"There was a massive outcry,\" says Charlotte. \"It's a friend, it's niche, and it's massively appreciated. It's the sound of the countryside. We give people who are not there a sense of what's happening in the fields. If you're not in farming, and you're out and about, you see farmers working and you think: 'I wonder what they're doing?' We fill in that gap.\" \nShe hosts the programme alongside Sybil Ruscoe, the former BBC Five Live presenter, and Anna Hill. After 20 years, it's still \"the best job in the world\". Her stock response, when people ask what she does for a living, is: \"I go to amazing places and talk to people\".But she is, she reckons, no expert. \n\"I've become very boring about cows,\" she says. \"And I do say to the kids: 'Ooooh, look at those sheep!' But I don't pretend to know huge amounts about farming. In the past, a long, long time ago, I've been known to say: 'Look at that field of wheat...' and it turned out to be barley.\"Has it, we muse, inspired agricultural ambitions of her own? \n\"I couldn't be a farmer,\" she says, having a good, hard belly laugh at the idea. \"It's really hard work, really long hours. You've got to have a good business head and I don't. I'm rubbish at selling myself and chasing invoices and things like that. I've no illusions about agriculture. It's a wonderful lifestyle but it's a hard, hard life.\" \nThere is part of her, though, she admits, that would like to up sticks and decamp back to the country. She and husband, journalist Mike Smith of The Times, and their two children, Maddy, 11, and nine-year-old Sam, live in London. \nAfter growing up on what she teasingly refers to as \"the wrong side of Quorn\", she hankers after a return to village life, to its familiarity, the rural routines. \n\"My parents still live in the village, in the house I came home to when I was born. It's a 1960s bungalow. When I was young, I hated the house and Quorn was too small. Now I think Quorn and the house are lovely. I think I understand villages, the shop, church – the community. I understand how it works. My children, though,\" she grins, \"are Londoners. How did that happen?\" \nThe daughter of two librarians – Jan from Yorkshire, and Geoff, who hailed from London – who settled in Leicestershire in the 1960s, rural England, for their daughter, was just, well, there. As a kid, she would meet friends and they would pedal into Loughborough on the (then unrestored) Great Central Railway. \"Five minutes, and we were out in the fields.\" \nAt seven, she started at Fairfield Preparatory in the town. The school, she jokes, has now built on the long-jump pit, scene of her greatest sporting triumph. \"I represented Fairfield at long jump. I'm not a natural sportswoman, so that was a big deal.\" \nA slight stutter that she developed led her parents to send her to a speech teacher, Mrs Sharpe. \n\"I was learning piano, which I was rubbish at and I hated. Oh god, don't write that down, my daughter will read it. Anyway, my parents said: 'You've got to do something'. So I carried on with Mrs Sharpe and did exams with LAMDA (London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art). \nShe moved up to Loughborough High, worked hard (\"with hindsight, I could have worked harder\") but academic success didn't come easy. One area where she excelled was public speaking. And when the school's public speaking team won a competition, the prize was a visit to Radio Leicester. \"I asked someone: 'How do you get into radio?' and they said: 'Do you want to volunteer?' and I said: 'Yes!' and my dad said: 'Argh!' because it was a Sunday morning show and there were no buses and he knew he would have to take me.\" \nIt was the early '80s. Charlotte started on a morning youth show. You might think it impossible to be axed as a volunteer, but no, the young Charlotte managed it. \"They got rid of me because I didn't have a Leicester accent. It went out live and I think they were trying to make it more 'urban'. \n\"Then I went to a religious show on a Sunday morning, with the Rev Ian Phelps.\" He was, she says, inspirational. \"Endlessly patient, kind and fun. He put a lot of time into all sorts of people, who owe him a lot.\" \nShe dogsbodied at Epic House, Radio Leicester's then base, from 14 to 18, making tea, answering phones and occasionally getting on air. \nShe studied English and drama at the University of Kent with dreams of becoming an actress. \"I realised I wasn't going to make it. I can't sing, I can't dance.\" \nShe toyed, briefly, with going into print journalism. But she couldn't spell, and this was in the days before spell-checkers, when editors got sniffy about mistakes. \nInstead, on graduating, the 20-something Charlotte, already a newsroom veteran, albeit an unpaid one, found herself on the BBC's prestigious Local Reporters Scheme, a scheme then so coveted that places on it were as rare as rocking horse poo. \nShe worked at stations in Sussex, Cumbria and Devon, before returning to Leicester as a reporter and, later, producer. \"It was the late '80s. The desk had a typewriter on it and a shelf above it with an ashtray on it. The older members of staff would come back from the pub at lunchtime and put their pints on it. The drinking culture of newsrooms was really coming to an end by then. We – the youngsters – used to go to the pub and have a toasted sandwich and an orange juice. They used to think we were lightweights.\" \nWhich pub? She can't remember. \"I'll check with Julian, Uncle Julian as we call him in our house,\" she grins. Julian is Julian Worricker, presenter of Radio 4's Any Answers and relief presenter on BBC News, who also cut his teeth at Radio Leicester at the same time. (The Royal Oak, he texts later). \nWorricker isn't the only Radio Leicester '80s young gun. \"I was really lucky to be there at that time\". The alumni are impressive: Fran Unsworth (now director of the BBC World Service Group), Julian, Kate Squire (editor at Radio Manchester and Iain Carter (BBC golf correspondent). \nThey covered the Kegworth plane crash. The breakout from Gartree Prison by helicopter. And they got used to interviewing city councillors – including the now mayor of Leicester, Peter Soulsby – in the dark (the council offices had strip lighting and their hum was picked up by the microphones). \nAfter four years, Charlotte went for a job on Radio 4 as a trainee producer on the Today programme. She came home with a producer's attachment – a six-month placement – on The World Tonight. \"It was a steep learning curve. They taught me how everything was done... and how to drink whisky.\" \nIn 1991, she moved into television as a reporter for a newly-launched regional TV programme: East Midlands Today before, three years later, leaving to work back in radio on another new launch: BBC Radio 5 Live, as a studio producer. \"It was us against the world. We had no resources. Radio 4 hated us. It was hard work – 11am until 11pm or 9pm until 9am. The shifts got to me.\" \nShe moved back to Radio 4 and the You and Yours consumer programme, and then to television, with a stint on The Really Useful Show. Then, one day, she bumped into a man in a lift: Andrew Thorman, head of the BBC's rural affairs. \n\"Can you present Farming Today for us tomorrow?\" he asked. \"Basically, he had mucked up the rota. And that's how I started.\"Her work on Farming Today, and television experience, led to an offer to work on Countryfile. \n\"I started in Countryfile when it was a daytime programme. I was doing the export of animals, disease. I tended to do the newsier stuff. But I bog-snorkelled, did a feature on naked calendars that were all the rage then.\" \nAnd then, in 2001, one of farming's darkest hours: foot-and-mouth disease. \n\"I remember in Cumbria, a really old farmer burst into tears on me. What did I do? I think I just hugged him. To be honest, the older I get the more I realise that what makes you a good journalist is being yourself. Being a fake, a phony, people spot you a mile off. If you burst into tears now, I'd hug you – because that's what I'd do if I wasn't a journalist.\" \nAnd this is where the story might wind up, a gentle foray into behind-the-scenes life of a reporter. \nBut this is where Charlotte's story takes a dogleg. In 2009, the BBC revamped the programme's format, moved it to its present early-evening slot. Four presenters – Michaela Strachan, Juliet Morris, Charlotte, all of them in their 40s, and Miriam O'Reilly, then in her early 50s – were not part of that revamp. \nO'Reilly took the BBC to court, a tribunal finding in her favour of her claims on the grounds of ageism and victimisation, but not sexism. Charlotte gave evidence in her support.\"The BBC argued the decision was based on the fact we didn't have high enough profiles. Miriam bravely decided to take it to tribunal.\" \nShe had, she says, two small children at home at the time. Countryfile demanded a lot of travelling. It was less of a blow to her, then, than it might have been. Still tough, we suggest, to stand up at a tribunal against your employer, an employer that still puts petrol in the tank today. She nods.\"But I think things are changing, slowly. The test will be if the people who are 20 years younger than us are still on TV in their 50s. It's an odd thing. You wouldn't find it happening with lawyers or doctors. In their 50s, they're at their peak. \n\"As a middle-aged woman, watching television, you could be forgiven for thinking: 'where are we?' I think you want to be able to see yourself, whoever you are, whatever your age, represented. With dramas like Last Tango in Halifax and Happy Valley, suddenly there were women who were my age on television.\" \nShe carried on working for Farming Today – ironically under the same boss as Countryfile. And then, six years after the tribunal, a friend, who worked on Countryfile, suggested they meet for a catch-up. \n\"She told me the presenter, Tom Heap, was having a couple of weeks off and would I like to go back. I sat there and my jaw hit the table. She said: \"Finally – I've managed to shut you up!\" \nShe's been back on our screens, when Tom's away, ever since. \"Notably, whenever he's off, it's because there's a job that involves wearing a hairnet. I swear – and I've told him this – that he does it on purpose. \n\"But now I'm back on TV and as far as I'm aware, no-one has written to the BBC and said: 'get that old crone off'. \"I'm 51 and bloody proud of it. I lost a dear friend to cancer a couple of years ago. That really makes me feel lucky. It seems ungrateful not to celebrate older people.\" \nAway from work, she says, she's 'basically quite boring'. She and Mike watch TV, hang out with the kids, take them to cricket practice, cook. \"In theory, on my days off, I bake, batch cook and freeze for the week. I'm evangelical that everybody needs to know how to cook. \n\"Both my kids can make cake, simple stuff. I've already told them they're not leaving home until they can cook five three-course meals. I mean, how impressed are your mates going to be at uni?\" \nAnd some weekends, she'll say to the kids: \"Come on, let's go home,\" and they'll jump in their old Picasso and battle the traffic up the M1 to Quorn to see her mum and dad. \"You know,\" she says, \"I think Leicestershire is slightly overlooked. And Charnwood has got some great bits. I think I had a really lucky, boring, childhood. \n\"I had a really nice time,\" she smiles, \"in a really nice place.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-06-05T18:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-06-05T18:58:52.948+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
