We think it is better to put our investment into ones that are a little further away. \n“So we will still have a Wetherspoon to go to in Newcastle but it does cause us heartache to lose the Union Rooms.” \nJD Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin has been visiting 100 of the company's pubs to discuss arguments for leaving the EU \nMr Martin made the comments in the Five Swans in Newcastle on Thursday as part of an EU referendum debate. \nAn outspoken Brexit supporter Mr Martin has been visiting 100 of the chain’s pubs to chat with punters about whether Britain should stay or go. \nHe said: “The EU is becoming more and more undemocratic. \n“The rules are made by an European commissioner who does not get elected and we can’t sack them. \n“We know from looking around the world that democracy always produces more prosperously, more jobs and more freedom as well. \n“If you look at Greece, Portugal and Spain, they are in big trouble and the EU is going the wrong way.” \nWith less than a week to go until the polls open, the leave campaign has gained ground with an increasing numbers of poll results pointing to Brexit. \nThe bookies have consistently given the remain campaign a bigger lead in the betting, but the odds to leave are now shortening. \nMr Martin added: “I think in Newcastle there has been a lot of debate in our pubs and I know people are talking about it a lot. \n“I believe we have got a chance of winning. I am optimistic.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-06-17T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-06-17T14:26:08.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
