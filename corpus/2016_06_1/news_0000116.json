During this time we have seen overwhelming support from our clients that has led us to achieving 20 per cent growth year upon year in our client base. \n\"We have employed and mentored four apprentices and we have employed a new member of staff every year. \n\"Prior to the referendum we planned to employ two more members of staff to help us support our clients growing needs. Following the result, our plans remain unchanged. \n\"We at Whitehall believe in our clients and their ability to adapt and thrive as they have done over the last eight years. \n\"Now is the time for the leave voters to get behind Leicester and drive us forward. \n\"Whilst those who voted to remain did not see the outcome they desired, we as a city should maintain the approach that has seen us grow over the last eight years. \n\"Support all businesses by continuing to enjoy the products and experiences Leicester has to offer, starting this weekend.\" \nPete Miller, corporate tax consultant with The Miller Partnership, in New Walk, Leicester, said Brexit could provide an opportunity for a \"root and branch\" review of the UK's tax system. \nHe said: \"If Brexit leads to some loss of business confidence in the short term, then taxes may rise, or might not fall, to try and compensate. \n\"But there are practical limits to how much extra tax can be raised by squeezing harder, when the UK's general tax burden is already high. \n\"By making fundamental changes, without having to worry about EU rules, we may be able to spread the tax burden more evenly and reduce rates overall. \n\"But it's unlikely that politicians will tell you that fundamental changes in the tax system are more attractive the further you are from the political process â€“ which is another way of saying that changing it isn't a vote winner! \n\"Most people outside tax probably do not realise how much of our tax system is impacted by EU laws. \n\"For example, the single market requirements of freedom of establishment and free movement of capital have meant the reliefs and exemptions applicable to UK companies have had to extend to other EU companies, too. \n\"The most famous case involved Marks & Spencer claiming tax relief for losses in its EU subsidiaries, which forced changes in the UK rules. \n\"It may be that some of the UK tax rules forced upon us by the EU will be repealed. But it will be a slow process and needs to be done in a way that does not damage the UK's general trading relationships.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-06-24T12:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-06-24T13:48:02.112+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
