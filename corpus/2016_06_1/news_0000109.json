He said: \"It's the uncertainty that concerns me. We haven't got a clue what Brexit will mean . \n\"The economy is stalling a little bit and you can talk your way into difficulty. Growth estimates for next year are not high and Brexit is not going to help. \n\"But it's going to be fantastic for the legal profession in the short-term if we vote out, because the complexities of extricating ourselves will be horrendous.\" \nDuncan Green, below, left, managing partner of national building consultancy Pick Everard, in Charles Street, Leicester, said they were experts in complying with EU procurement rules, so a Brexit vote would be an obvious setback . \nHe said: \"I think we [the UK] have done well out of the EU and have had a stable economy, and I know we've been through a recession, but I don't think that was as deep as it might have been. \n\"I don't think there are any clubs where you would be treated better if you left than if you stayed in. \n\"I think the UK contributes well to Europe.\" \nHowever, Chris Darlington, partner at accountants Mazars' Leicester office, said: \"The problem for me is that people will vote to stay in because they feel it's better to stick with what they know. \nReal estate lawyer Richard Osborn, partner and regional office head at Weightmans, Leicester, said he had not seen many \"sound, solid\" arguments for leaving. \nHe said: \"We are neutral as a business, but I'm firmly in the remain camp. \n\"I think it will cause a lot of uncertainty for a long time. \n\"I think property investment generally has gone a little lukewarn.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-06-07T12:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-06-07T12:42:59.762+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
