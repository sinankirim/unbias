It’s for the voters of this country to make their informed decision. \n“One of the things we’ve done is survey all our customers and less than 1% said they were going to be influenced by the celebrities, the big personalities, politicians or big businesses coming out one way or the other.” \nMr Kelly said much of the EU debate so far had been “myopic and quite hysterical”, though he felt there had been some improvements in recent days. \nAsked whether Sage would remain based in Newcastle if the country votes for Brexit, Mr Kelly said: “Absolutely. This is our spiritual home, the North East is important to us and we’re the largest private sector employer in Newcastle. \n“Furthermore, we’ve done the analysis internally and we anticipate, unless something cataclysmic happens - which we don’t anticipate - the business would carry on and the impact would be immaterial.” \nIn yesterday’s debate, Lucy Armstrong and Herb Kim made the case for remaining in the EU, with Ms Armstrong saying that the the country was better off remaining part of the organisation so that it could influence its rules. \nPro-Brexit campaign Matt Ridley said the EU “encourages antagonism to innovation” and argued that the UK would be better off outside of the organisation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-06-13T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-06-13T20:33:43.654+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
