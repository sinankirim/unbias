which runs Barratt and David Wilson Homes - said he was confident they could deal with whatever happened next and demand for new homes would continue. \nHe said: \"We have prepared for this eventuality and whilst we recognise there will be a period of uncertainty as the UK's exit is negotiated, the strong fundamentals of our business are unchanged. \n\"There is a structural undersupply of quality homes in the UK, and we have a clear strategy to address this, supported by a strong balance sheet to execute our growth plans. \n\"We lead the industry for the quality and design of our homes, and our customers love what we build. \n\"We are confident our business can respond to the changing landscape and we remain focussed on driving it forward.\" \nBosses at north west Leicestershire haulage business Pall-Ex recently signed a deal with one of Bulgaria's biggest transport and logistics providers Econt. \nIt was part of a growing continental network, spanning the UK, Spain, Portugal, Romania, Italy, France and Benelux regions. \nPall-Ex has also been working on partnerships in Germany, Hungary, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Scandinavia. \nIt about 300 staff based in Ellistown or out in the field. \nKevin Buchanan said: \"As a business, we've always said that Britain is stronger in Europe. \n\"We're saddened that the majority of people didn't share our view. \n\"We stand firm in our belief that the UK's supply chain will be deeply affected by the referendum outcome, as it's always relied on an efficient international logistics network. \n\"Jobs, trade and investment are all likely to be impacted. \n\"As a country, we now enter a crucial period of negotiation regarding the terms of our exit. \n\"The Government has a tricky task ahead and we urge them to listen to the concerns of businesses across the country. \n\"Like every other company, we must now take stock of what's happened and ensure that processes are in place to lessen the inevitable impact. \n\"Our number one priority has always been, and remains, our haulier members and customers. \n\"Over the coming months, we'll be doing all we can to support them and ensure that, as much as possible, it remains business as usual. \nPall-Ex is an umbrella company for almost 100 haulage firms – ranging from one-person bands to giants with turnovers of more than tens of millions – which work together to move pallets up and down the UK.
