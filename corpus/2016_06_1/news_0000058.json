But let me be clear - you should not underestimate our resolve. \n“We were prepared for the unexpected and we are equipped for whatever happens. And we are determined that, unlike eight years ago, our financial system will help our country deal with any shocks and dampen them, not contribute to those shocks or make them worse.” \nThe Chancellor’s intervention came ahead of the opening of markets in London, as Boris Johnson broke cover in a bid to start healing Tory wounds ripped open by the bitter referendum battle. Stefan Rousseau/PA Wire Boris Johnson holds a press conference at Brexit HQ in Westminster \nMr Johnson, the frontrunner to replace David Cameron for PM, used an article in the Daily Telegraph to insist that Britain would not turn its back on Europe and would be able to introduce a points-based immigration system while maintaining access to the Single Market. \nMr Cameron was due to chair an emergency Cabinet meeting, while US secretary of state John Kerry was visiting London and Brussels for talks on the fallout from the vote. \nMeanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was insisting he will not stand down in the face of a rebellion which saw 11 members of the shadow cabinet quit on Sunday following the sacking of Hilary Benn as Shadow Foreign Secretary. \nAnd further resignations have already taken place on Monday ahead of a crunch meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party. \nShadow Foreign Minister Diana Johnson, Shadow Civil Society Minister Anna Turley and Shadow Defence Minister Toby Perkins all resigned as the protest against Mr Corbyn’s leadership continued.
