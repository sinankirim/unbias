But for Newcastle United, a Brexit transfer policy could look very, very different. Here’s how things could change – and the hoops they have to jump through to get non-EU players into the club now. This doesn’t mean the end of foreign players at Newcastle does it? \nIn a word: no. And it’s a confusing picture with so little known about what happens next. \nThe Premier League – where United hope to play by the time Brexit is confirmed – say: “The Premier League is a hugely successful sporting competition that has strong domestic and global appeal. This will continue to be the case regardless of the referendum result. Given the uncertain nature of what the political and regulatory landscape might be following the ‘Leave’ vote, there is little point second guessing the implications until there is greater clarity. \n“Clearly, we will continue to work with Government and other bodies whatever the outcome of any process.” \nBut it’s difficult to see how it can’t have an impact if free movement between EU countries – one of the key debating points of the referendum which appears to have swung it in favour of Leave in some areas – is tempered or abolished. \nOne theory is that every foreign player will have to go through the process that applies to non-EU players now. So young, untested players are out? \nForget about signing anyone under the age of 18, according to Carol Couse, of law firm Mills and Reev. \nFifa rules forbid clubs from signing players from other countries until they are 18, but an exception is that players can move freely within the European Union at the age of 16. \nThat rule - article 19 - will now not apply to UK clubs meaning young European talent will be subject to the same work permits rules as those outside the EU. \nMs Couse told the Liverpool Echo: “The Article 19 exemption is fundamental to how UK clubs acquire young talented and cost-effective players. \n“Investing heavily in talented under-18 players is the ultimate low-risk, high-reward strategy. \n“Given the low cost of acquisition and the amount of money it would cost to acquire a high-calibre player on the transfer market, a club needs only a very small percentage of young players to develop into a successful professional footballer in order to see a positive return on its investment. \n“Naturally, losing the Article 19 exception would have adverse consequences for UK clubs. It is crucial for clubs to sign talented players they have identified at the earliest possible occasion, so as to limit their acquisition costs and boost their profits in the event of a subsequent sale of a young talent they have developed.” Even more senior imports could be impacted: Newcastle United goalkeeper Tim Krul \nWe estimated that nine of the United’s current squad would be unlikely to sign, based on the idea that untested European players would not longer be allowed to sign for Newcastle. \nSigning the likes of Ayoze Perez and Tim Krul would seem unlikely in post-Brexit England, although it remains to be seen what deal is agreed in the long and probably tortuous process ahead. \nWhat would be the practical impact on United’s transfer policy? \nUnder Rafa Benitez United are looking to move in a different direction but it would be difficult to see a repeat of the Graham Carr era, when the likes of Massaido Haidara were scouted and signed on the cheap because they were thought to represent better value than bringing in Luke Shaw – who Newcastle were quoted £12million for before he’d played much football for Southampton. \nWould that mean more games for young English players? In theory, yes. It might even improve the England side in the long-term. But turning off the tap of young, European talent who can progress in England would surely redraw the landscape of English football once again (the TV deal being the last time that happened). Do Newcastle have experience of this? \nLast season they signed Chancel Mbemba from Anderlecht – a DR Congo national – and Aleksandar Mitrovic, from non-EU Serbia. Both passed the criteria because they have played substantial international football. So how does the current process work for Non-EU nationals? Christopher Furlong/Getty Images A European Union flag, with a hole cut in the middle, flies at half-mast outside a home in Knutsford Cheshire after today's historic referendum on June 24, 2016 in Knutsford, United Kingdom \nGreg Dyke made tightening the work permit criteria a key part of his FA Commission because he wanted to stop the flow of foreign players coming into the English game who aren’t much better than young English players. \nDyke claims that the old regulations were too easy to pass and too many players who weren’t necessarily good enough were moving to the Premier League. He said that under the new regulations, 33% of the players who got a work permit in the last five years would have been refused. \nThe regulations aren’t designed to stop really good players moving to England, regardless of age or nationality. How do Newcastle sign Non-EU players? \nAt the moment, to sign a non-EU player, Newcastle need Governing Body Endorsement (GBE). Essentially that means they need the FA to endorse their application to get a work permit from the Home Office. \nThis can be done one of two ways – either by passing the automatic criteria or by being approved by a three-man panel. Who qualifies? \nYou can view the guidelines in full here: www.thefa.com/football-rules-governance/more/player-registration/points-based-system . \nAccording to the FA’s own regulations they will automatically grant a GBE if a player has played in the “required percentage” of his countries’ games in the “reference period” (24 months before the application date). \nYou qualify automatically if: \n- You play 30% of international games for a nation ranked between 1 and ten in the world \n- You play 45% of international games for a nation ranked between 11 and 20 in the world \n- You play 60% of international games for a nation ranked between 21 and 30 in the world \n- You play 75% of international games for a nation ranked between 31 and 50 in the world What if they don’t qualify automatically? \nIt goes down to a panel. Who is on the panel? David Davies/PA Wire Greg Dyke \nIt’s a three-person panel, chaired by an independent, legally qualified person. There will then be two additional people on the panel with experience at the “top level” of the game. They have to be independent, with no conflict of interest. \nThe FA’s guidelines say: “No individual who would objectively be considered to have a current association with the applicant club will be appointed to the Exceptions Panel.” How do they reach their decision? \nThey would take into account the fee Newcastle have paid, the wages he’ll get and the quality of the club the player is joining from. The idea is that if United have paid a lot for him – and are paying him more than most in their squad – they are backing their own judgement that he’s better than what they’ve got. How do the FA value that? \nIt’s a points process – and any non-EU player needs to get four points to qualify (although the panel doesn’t have to pass it, even if he does). The guidelines say: “They are under no obligation to issue a Governing Body Endorsement even when the relevant points threshold is crossed.” \nIt’s separated into primary review criteria – the most important – and secondary review criteria, which is taken into account if the player doesn’t get across the four-point threshold.
