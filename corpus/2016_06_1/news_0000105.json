The EU referendum is almost here. Are you for Remain or Brexit? \nBack in 1975, the last time the county voted on whether to stay in or leave Europe , the word ‘Brexit’ didn’t exist (although it does sound like it could have been a brand of breakfast cereal from the time!) \nIn the event, just two years after Britain’s 1973 entry into the so-called Common Market, we voted to stay in - and that’s where we’ve been ever since. \nWhat was different then compared to now was that Labour who were in power at the time, broadly speaking, wanted to leave Europe, while the bulk of Tories wanted to stay. \nBut what else was happening back on Thursday, June 5, 1975, when the last EU referendum took place? \nEvening Chronicle, Thursday, June 5, 1975 THAT DAY’S CHRONICLE: \nWe reported that “rain was keeping many people away from the polls ... but officials were hoping for a big rush after teatime to produce a General Election-sized turn-out.” We also reported how the polls - accurately as it turned out - were predicting a victory for the “stay in Europe” vote. \nAway from Europe, our front page carried adverts for Binns store in Newcastle which was selling men’s shirts for £1.95, while at Bewick a ‘double sprung edge drawer divan bed’ would knock you back £99.95. OUR BACK PAGE: \nJohn Gibson was reporting that Newcastle United were closing in on a new manager, following the departure of Joe Harvey, and there were “three men shortlisted”. The job would eventually go to Gordon Lee. OTHER HEADLINES: \nElsewhere in world and national news, Britain’s first North Sea oil began to flow, an inquest found Lord Lucan guilty of murdering his child’s nanny, and world heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali was preparing to defend his title against Joe Bugner. PRICES: \nThis was an era of rocketing prices as inflation reached 25% in the UK. The average house price was £11,000, you could buy a car for £1,840, while the average annual salary was £2,500. A loaf of bread cost 19p, a pint of beer around 30p, and a packet of 20 ciggies - socially acceptable at that time - around 42p LIFE EXPECTANCY: \nMen in 1975 could expect to live until they were 69, while women would, on average, reach 76 - compared to around 76 and 81 today respectively. GOVERNMENT: \nHarold Wilson was Labour Prime Minster, while earlier in the year Margaret Thatcher had sensationally become leader of the Tory opposition, although most commentators gave her no chance of ever becoming PM! IN THE POP CHARTS: \nStars of TV’s It Ain’t Half Hot Mum, Winsdor Davies and Don Estelle, were at number one with Whispering Grass, while Showaddywaddy with Three Steps To Heaven, and 10cc with I’m Not In Love were other big sellers. In the pre-digital age, you bought vinyl records and played them on newfangled stereos. AT THE CINEMA: \nIf you were stepping out at Newcastle Odeon, or perhaps the Haymarket, you would be watching the likes of Monty Python and the Holy Grail, The Return of the Pink Panther, while the end of the month would see the release of the blockbuster, Jaws. ON THE TELEVISION: \nOn June 5, 1975, kids could tune into the likes of Jackanory and Blue Peter, while Top of the Pops, Dad’s Army and The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau were on in the evening. FASHION: \nThis was the era of long hair for both sexes, flares, shirts with XL collars, high-waist trousers, and aftershave like Brut and Hai Karate, the smellier the better! FOOD AND DRINK: \nYou might tuck into Birds Eye Steakburger, crinkle-cut chips and frozen peas, washed down with a bottle of Cresta pop. And who remembers the Aztec chocolate bar - Cadbury’s long-gone version of the Mars Bar? Happy days! \nAnd that the way we were on the occasion of the last EU referendum on June 5, 1975...
