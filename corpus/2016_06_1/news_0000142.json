with 50.7% of those voting backing EU membership and 49.3% voting to leave. \nIt was the first result to be announced with the exception of Gibraltar, and the narrow victory came as an unpleasant surprise for Remain campaigners, who had expected to win by a larger margin in the city. \nAnd it was followed a series of decisive victories for the leave campaign across the region. \nIn Sunderland, the turnout there was a clear win for the leave campaign, with 61.3% voting to get out of the EU. \nIn South Tyneside, 68% voted to leave while in Gateshead 56.8% rejected EU membership. \nThe result on North Tyneside was closer , as 53.4%, voted for leave. \nNationwide it became clear at around 4.45am on Friday as counting continued that the Leave campaign had won, with around 52% of the national vote. BBC analysts calculated it was impossible for the remain campaign to win, based on the votes counted so far. \nThe nation’s decision was a victory for the leave campaign backed by Boris Johnson, the senior Conservative seen as the most likely candidate to succeed David Cameron as Tory leader. \nBut it was a rejection of Britain’s political establishment, following a referendum campaign in which Mr Cameron, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Liberal Democrat Leader Tim Farron and leaders of the Green Party and SNP all pleaded with voters to vote to remain in the EU. \nThe Prime Minister was set to make a statement outside 10 Downing Street.

The referendum result does not mean the UK immediately leaves the EU. \nMr Cameron is expected to consider over the weekend whether to begin the process of leaving the European Union, which means triggering Article 50 of the Treaty on the European Union - the section which sets out what a member state has to do if they want to go. \nAnd MPs who supported the Leave campaign want him to take his time, on the basis that it will be important to negotiate the best possible exit deal with the EU. \nBut it remains to be seen how long Mr Cameron can remain Prime Minister. \nHe personally led the Remain campaign and made a number of visits to the North East during the referendum, including trips to Hitachi in County Durham. \nThe result sparked immediate speculation that Mr Cameron would be forced to resign. \nMPs who backed the Remain campaign published a letter as the votes were being counted, insisting the Prime Minister had a “duty” to stay in office however the country voted.
