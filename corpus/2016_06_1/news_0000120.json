X \nCopy link to paste in your message / Comments (0) \nPICTURE two exhausted and bloody boxers in the ring after a 15-round bout. One raises an arm in victory before slumping into his corner. His opponent lies flat on the canvas. The crowd looks on in disbelief, the favourite has been defeated. \nThere may be some euphoria in the Brexit camp. But this has been a vicious campaign, punctuated by vitriol, hyperbole, outright lies and a moment of terrible tragedy. \nDid Jeremy Corbyn's lacklustre Remain campaign undermine Labour supporters' backing for Europe? \nCertainly some party grandees think so and are already calling his leadership into question. \nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon is agitating for a second referendum on independence and who can blame her when Scots came out in such strength for Remain? \nEurope has reacted with dismay, with the exception of the far right, with Marine Le Pen bolstering her credentials to be the next French president by calling for a similar referendum in France. \nAnd on the financial markets, shares went into freefall, along with sterling. \nSo where is the sunny upland in what UKIP leader Nigel Farage declared the nation's Independence Day? \nRead more: Employers in Leicestershire preparing for tough months ahead after EU Referendum vote \nFirst and foremost it is a momentous but nevertheless clear democratic decision. The people's desire to leave Europe spoke louder than that of the Prime Minister, Barack Obama, the Bank of England and a host of leading economists. \nSecond, we know the direction we are going in. We can look forward to a time when we are masters of our own destiny. \nNo more need to moan about diktats from unelected Brussels bureaucrats, we will be making our own bed and lying in it. \nBut to get there we need strong leadership to ensure a stable exit from the European Union, one that does not put our economy and our security at risk but one that ensures we prosper on our own. \nWe need to maintain relationships with our continental neighbours while building new ones both within Europe and further afield. \nAnd we need to retain the tolerance, diversity and fairness that define Britain. \nAnd we should celebrate our ability to make a decision, where every vote counts the same. \nNow we need to pull together as a nation. We will be on our own and it is up to us to make it work. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-06-25T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-06-25T12:05:26.345+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
