Flight delay compensation \nThe EU forces airlines to pay compensation to passengers whose flight gets them into their destination more than three hours late if they’re flying to or from a European Union airport. \nPassengers can claim between €250 (approx £197) and €600 (approx £473). Airlines can only get out of paying if they can prove the delay was down to an “extraordinary circumstance” like a terrorist threat or freak weather. \nIf Britain left the EU, customers may lose this right to compensation - although it is thought they may be able to still claim if flying to the UK from an EU country, or to the continent on an EU based airline, such as KLM, Air France and Lufthansa. Duty Free alcohol and cigarettes \nThe days of bulk-buying tobacco and spirits may be over if Britain leaves the EU. \nCurrently, Brits can technically bring as much tobacco and alcohol as they want from EU countries, although Border Force can bat an eyelid if travellers come back with astronomical amounts which clearly are not for personal use. \nIf we leave, duty free allowances could be re-introduced for travellers coming back from EU countries. \nCurrently, passengers travelling from outside the EU can bring in only one litre of spirits and 16 litres of beer or four litres of wine. They are allowed 200 cigarettes or 250g of tobacco. Any more could leave you with a hefty duty bill, or it could be confiscated. \nWith other goods, passengers coming from outside the EU are allowed a maximum of £390 in value, or, oddly, £270 if coming in by private plane or boat. Jack Taylor/PA Wire Prime Minister David Cameron delivers a speech to easyJet employees Using your mobile phone abroad \nRecently the EU has clamped down on phone networks imposing ludicrous charges on customers using their tariff abroad. \nIt has gradually lowered a cap on mobile data roaming charges - from €0.70 (55p) per MB to €0.05 (4p) per MB. \nThe cost of calling has gone down too. Since April, a maximum charge of €0.05 (4p) a minute for making calls been in place. \nFrom June, roaming charges will be scrapped for EU customers using their phone in other EU countries. \nIf Britain leaves, customers may lose their right to cheaper calls abroad. \nCurrently, making a call to the UK from the USA on an O2 mobile can cost £1.10 a minute, while data can cost £6 a minute. \nIf calling from Norway - a European country which is not in the EU - calls will cost 3.6p a minute on an O2 mobile, with data charged at 4.3p per MB. \nFrom Turkey it costs £1.50 a minute to call and £6 per MB of data. \nThe roaming cap does cover other European countries - including Iceland and Norway - but not some, such as Turkey. Holiday cash \nSterling’s value has dropped against the Euro in the run up to the referendum. If Britain leaves, many expect it to weaken further. It may be wise to get your holiday money now if you are travelling after June 23’s vote. \nA fall in the pound’s value against the Euro will make your holidays to Europe more expensive. Lauren Hurley/PA Wire The Twitter app on an Apple iPhone 6s Healthcare \nThe European health Insurance Card (EHIC) gives Britons the same rights to healthcare as residents in other European countries. It does not make the care free of charge, but means you are not charged as a treated as a private patient - reducing the chance of huge medical bills should you fall ill abroad. \nThe EHIC card applies in some non-EU countries who are part of the European Economic Area (EEA), such as Norway, Iceland and Switzerland. \nIf the UK leaves the EU but remains in the EEC, then you should still be able to use your EHIC in the same way as before. But there is no guarantee the EEA will automatically accept a post-EU Britain, and new deals may have to be made. While that is being negotiated, agreements like the EHIC may be put on hold. \nShould Britain leave the EU, it could make agreements with individual countries on healthcare - as it does with Russia and former Soviet Bloc nations which are not in the European Union.
