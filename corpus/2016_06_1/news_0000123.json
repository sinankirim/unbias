of course we have excellent labour relations, the English language, a very hard working workforce, great engineers - but they also invest here because we are members of the single market. \n“And I thought what the head of Hitachi said this week about wanting us to be the European headquarters, to manufacture trains in the North East and sell them all over Europe, and how that might not be possible if we were to leave, was an incredibly powerful statement.” \nHe added: “So in my clear view jobs come first, and if people want to vote for jobs they should vote for remain on June 23.” PA Wire Helen Goodman \nMr Cameron was responding to a question from Bishop Auckland MP Helen Goodman, who claimed that economists who support leaving the UK were happy for manufacturing to disappear. \nShe highlighted comments by Prof Patrick Minford, a former economics adviser to Margaret Thatcher and professor of economics at Cardiff University, who said in May that the economy would grow if the UK left - but the decline of unskilled manufacturing would be hastened. \nProf Minford also said that the UK would continue to have advanced or high-tech manufacturing industries outside the EU. \nMrs Goodman said: “With industrialists like Glaxo and Hitachi warning that if we left the EU jobs would be lost, the Brexit economist Patrick Minford has revealed that their strategy means manufacturing would be mostly eliminated. \n“Would the Prime Minister join me in calling on the Brexit leaders to says how many of other people’s jobs they would sacrifice?” \nEarlier this week, Mr Nakanishi said he was worried about the effect leaving the EU would have on the UK. \nHiroaki Nakanishi, CEO of Hitachi \nMr Nakanishi said: “I would like to explain how Brexit would affect us at Hitachi, and why we think it’s important for Britain to remain in Europe. \nHe said: “For most global companies like Hitachi, the critical benefit of investing in the UK is that it is the best base for accessing the whole European market of 500m people. \n“There are other reasons like the size of the UK market, availability of local and international talent and the support of our local communities – which is why we take a positive view of the UK inside Europe. \n“Therefore we have our regional headquarters here and moved our global rail headquarters to London. \n“But take away the UK’s membership of the EU, and the future investment case looks very different.” \nJapanese firms invested in the UK and employed a British workforce because it meant they would be treated as European companies, he said. \n“We worry because those advocating Brexit have no answer to how the UK could negotiate cost-free access to this huge market from a position outside it. \n“It would take a long time and result in uncertain market conditions; during this renegotiation period, investors would probably be waiting to see the outcomes, hold back on investment, and jobs would be lost.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-06-09T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-06-09T11:10:58.352+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
