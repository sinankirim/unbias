by 1,800 votes - for the region to remain in the EU. \nNationwide it became clear at around 4.45am on Friday as counting continued that the Leave campaign had won, with around 52% of the national vote. BBC analysts calculated it was impossible for the remain campaign to win, based on the votes counted so far. \nThe nation’s decision was a victory for the leave campaign backed by Boris Johnson, the senior Conservative seen as the most likely candidate to succeed David Cameron as Tory leader. \nThe official result was announced at 6am. \nThe North East overwhelmingly voted to leave the EU \nVoters went to the polls on Thursday and by the time most people had woken up, the future of our nation was clear — Britain wanted to leave the EU. \nHowever, it was much earlier that the North East sent out a signal that it was going to be a good night for the Leave campaign. \nAs polls closed, the Remain camp seem buoyed by the high turnout and the last few polls suggesting they were on course for the victory. Mary Turner/PA Wire Boris Johnson holds a press conference at Brexit HQ in Westminster, London \nBut the shockwaves from the region’s first declared results reached American actress Lindsay Lohan, who then sent social media into overdrive over her Sunderland tweets. \nNationally, they claimed victory by 52% to Remain’s 48%, with a turnout of 72%, but that margin was much higher in the North East, with 58% of voters crossing the ‘leave’ box on the ballot paper. \nThe result cost David Cameron his job \nIf you cast your mind back to when David Cameron was the new, fresh-faced leader of the Conservatives, he told the party they had alienated voters by “banging on” about Europe. \nThe Tory party has long been divided over the issue of Europe, and Cameron is not the first scalp it has claimed. \nUnder the Farage-led UKIP surge before the last election, the spectre of Europe reared its head once more. To stave off the perceived threat of UKIP and to appease the eurosceptic wing of his party, Cameron bowed to demands for a referendum on our EU membership.

Mr Johnson previously insisted he had less chance of taking the top job than being “reincarnated as an olive” but his protestations have done little to disguise his leadership ambitions. After leading the Brexiteers to victory his stock among the widely Eurosceptic Conservatives grassroots will be higher than ever. \nFellow Vote Leave campaigner Michael Gove has seen his public profile increase even more over the last few weeks as one of the leading figures in the successful campaign, which will do him no harm among Tory party members. \nTwo of the most likely remain-backing candidates to challenge for the top role are home secretary Theresa May and the PM’s close political ally George Osborne, who have both been very quiet in the wake of the leave vote. \nHowever, at this stage nobody knows, as the Labour party would happily testify with Jeremy Corbyn beating 100-1 odds to claim their own leadership battle last year. John Linton/PA Wire Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn \nAnd Jeremy Corbyn’s future is also under threat \nDame Margaret Hodge has submitted a motion - seconded by backbencher Ann Coffey - to the Parliamentary Labour Party calling for a motion of no confidence in Jeremy Corbyn. \nShe told Sky News: “The European referendum was a test of leadership and I think Jeremy failed that test,” \n“He came out too slowly, he was very half-hearted about his attempts to campaign and Labour voters simply didn’t get the message.” \nDame Margaret said any vote in the Parliamentary Labour Party would be by secret ballot so rebels would not have to declare their opposition publicly: \n“I hope, in the context of a secret ballot, that there will be overwhelming support for this motion I am putting and Jeremy will do the decent thing and resign.” \nA spokesman for Mr Corbyn condemned the motion as a “self-indulgent act”, although he acknowledged it had been discussed at a post-referendum meeting of the shadow cabinet. \n“It is a time when our party should be uniting to deal with the real issues that face Britain and the real issues that face the people of Britain, and so to create divisions in the party is a bit of a self-indulgent act,” the spokesman said. \nThe motion comes amid mounting criticism of Mr Corbyn’s failure to galvanise traditional Labour voters in support of Remain - with northern strongholds voting for Leave. \nDespite the victory for leave, there won’t be a Brexit any time soon...

We regret this decision but respect it. \n“We now expect the United Kingdom Government to give effect to this decision of the British people as soon as possible, however painful that process may be. \n“Any delay would unnecessarily prolong uncertainty. We have rules to deal with this in an orderly way.” \nThis may not be the end of referendums \nSNP leader Nicola Sturgeon also gave a speech, in which she said the Scottish government are looking at having another independence referendum after the UK voted to leave the EU, despite Scotland voting in favour to remain. \nThe Scottish Government will therefore draw up legislation to allow a second independence referendum to be held, the first minister confirmed. \nWhile the UK as a whole voted to leave the European Union, Scots overwhelmingly opted to remain, with Ms Sturgeon declaring the result meant there had been a “significant and material change in the circumstances in which Scotland voted against independence” in 2014. \nShe said: \n“As things stand, Scotland faces the prospect of being taken out of the EU against our will. I regard that as democratically unacceptable.” More on the EU Referendum", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-06-24T21:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-06-24T22:40:39.556+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
