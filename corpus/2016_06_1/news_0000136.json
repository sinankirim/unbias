Stefan Rousseau - WPA Pool/Getty Images Michael Gove MP (L) speaks during a press conference following the results of the EU referendum \nHe said: “As we move forward we should be in no doubt that Britain is embarking on a new chapter and one that is in line with our best traditions. \n“We can build a new, stronger and more positive relationship with our European neighbours based on free trade and friendly co-operation. \n“We can have democratic consent for an immigration policy that is fairer and more humane. \n“We can demonstrate that our progressive, liberal and democratic traditions are being renewed, and that we stand with all our allies as resolute as ever against intolerance and oppression. \n“We can take our place as a self-governing democracy, alongside other great nations, working for greater global development, security and prosperity. \n“And we can now, calmly and united, take our country forward in the spirit of the warm, humane and generous values that are the best of Britain.” \nEchoing Mr Johnson’s warning that there process of leaving would not be a quick one, he explained: “In the coming days, Government ministers and officials can meet to decide the next steps; officials and diplomats can start scoping out the broad parameters for full-scale talks with our European friends and the institutions in Brussels. \n“Our shared mission is clear: securing the best possible terms for Britain and, of course, informal discussions should proceed our formal negotiations.” More on the EU Referendum", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-06-24T15:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-06-24T16:18:23.763+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
