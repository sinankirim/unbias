A day after we vote out of the EU we look at the challenges ahead 12:15, 25 Jun 2016 Boris or Michael? Corbyn's future? What happens now the dust settles on our EU departure vote Shares Get daily news by email Mary Turner - WPA Pool/Getty Images Boris Johnson speaks following the results of the EU referendum \nIt has been more than 24 hours since the North East - and Britain - voted to leave the EU - so what happens now and where do we go from here? \nWith David Cameron packing his bags, the focus shifts onto new leadership and who will oversee our separation from Europe. Will it be Boris Johnson or Michael Gove? \nJeremy Corbyn said on Saturday that those concerned about immigration must not be derided as “little Englanders” or “racists”. But what about his future? New leadership \nDavid Cameron announced he would step down in the autumn as he was not the right “captain to steer the country to its next destination”. \nSo that means a new Conservative leader and prime minister is expected to be elected by the end of September. \nConservative MPs would hold a series of ballots, with all but the two most popular candidates being eliminated. The final two will then go into a run-off in which all Conservative Party members will get a vote. \nWith Boris Johnson and Michael Gove leading the party’s Brexit campaign - could they be our new leaders? Is Corbyn next to go? \nWith Cameron gone, the pressure is now on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn from inside his own party. \nSwathes of voters in Labour heartlands like Sunderland and parts of Tyneside voted against Mr Corbyn who was in favour of remaining in the EU. \nTwo MPs have submitted a motion of no confidence in Mr Corbyn, accusing him of weak leadership during the referendum. \nThis is not a formal mechanism for removing Mr Corbyn and he could survive even if the vote, should it take place, went against him. The Stock Market The 'Gherkin' and Canary Wharf at sunrise in the City of London \nMarket reaction to the referendum result was immediate and dramatic. \nThe FTSE 100 index of leading shares fell 8% after opening in London. There was a big sell-off of bank shares and housebuilders, with Barclays and RBS at one point down by more than 30%. By the end of trading, the index had bounced back, closing 2.8% down. The FTSE 250 index closed down 7%. \nThe value of the pound has also been hit hard on the foreign exchange markets, tumbling to lows not seen since 1985. At one stage, it hit $1.3305, a fall of more than 10%, although it too slightly recovered to close down 9% at £1.36. How do we exit? \nIn order to begin the separation from Europe there is a legal process, known as Article 50. \nMr Cameron wants his successor to decide when to activate Article 50 by notifying the European Council. But Europe is more anxious to get the process moving as quickly as possible. \nOnce this happens, the UK is cut out of EU decision-making at the highest level and there will be no way back unless by unanimous consent from all other member states. \nQuitting the EU is not an automatic process - it has to be negotiated with the remaining 27 members and ultimately approved by them by qualified majority. Next week Lauren Hurley/PA Wire Prime Minister David Cameron speaks outside 10 Downing Street, London, with wife Samantha where he announced his resignation after Britain voted to leave the European Union in an historic referendum which has thrown Westminster politics into disarray and sent the pound tumbling on the world markets.

Photo credit should read: Lauren Hurley/PA Wire \nMonday will be a big day in Parliament. \nDavid Cameron will make a statement on the referendum expected to take place in the afternoon. \nThe process of extricating the UK from the EU will ultimately involve rescinding the 1972 European Communities Act, the brief piece of legislation that brought the country into the European Economic Community, as it was then known, and which gives primacy to EU law in the UK. \nIt will also mean sifting through an estimated 80,000 pages of EU agreements, which have been enacted over the past five decades, to decide which will be repealed, amended or retained. Boris and Michael Stefan Rousseau/PA Wire Michael Gove (left) and Boris Johnson hold a press conference at Brexit HQ in Westminster, London, after David Cameron has announced he will quit as Prime Minister \nSo who is going to do all the negotiating on behalf of places like the North East? \nThe current senior members of the Government were all in the “Remain” camp so many may head off to pastures new with Mr Cameron. \nIt seems certain the next prime minister - whoever they may be - will take charge of the process. Could this be either Boris Johnson or Michael Gove?
