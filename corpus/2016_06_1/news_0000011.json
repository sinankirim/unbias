I did not go to the referendum count on the advice of the police as they thought it was a place where people would expect me to be. \n“I thought it was just individuals sitting on their keyboards making threats, but after what happened to Jo you have to take more precautions, especially for your family,” \nShe added: “I was the Shadow Minister for Europe so naturally I came in for a bit more focus, but one email was sent to my family - that is just beyond the pale.” \nMrs Glass called for calm following the vote for Brexit on Friday morning. She said: “This has been a very difficult campaign with a massive polarisation of opinion. \n“I really do think it has brought the best and worst out in people. I have never experienced anything like it in 40 years of campaigning - I would now like to see things return to some normality. \n“In the North East, the majority of MPs campaigned to remain and the majority of the North East voted to leave so there now needs to be a time of reflection I think, I believe in democracy and we have to accept the result and move forward now.” More on the EU Referendum", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-06-26T17:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-06-26T18:25:56.207+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
