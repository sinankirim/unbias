Our reasons are straightforward: businesses and their employees benefit massively from being able to trade inside the world’s largest single market without barriers. \n“As business people, we are always looking to the future – and a future inside the European Union is where we see more opportunities for investment, growth and new jobs. \n“We know that Britain leaving the EU would mean having to re-establish terms of trade from scratch with our home market of 500m consumers. That wouldn’t just hurt exporters but the hundreds of thousands of small and medium firms who do business with them. \n“Even those that want Britain to leave say that, in the short term, Brexit would lead to economic uncertainty and would put jobs at risk. Smaller businesses and the people they employ are particularly vulnerable to any economic shock which could follow a vote to leave the EU. \n“Britain leaving the EU would mean uncertainty for our firms, less trade with Europe and fewer jobs. Britain remaining in the EU would mean the opposite – more certainty, more trade and more jobs. EU membership is good for business and good for British jobs. That’s why, on June 23, we back Britain remaining in the EU.” \nAmong the signitaries to the letter are Duncan Young, managing director of estate agents Sanderson Young, Lucy Armstrong of The Alchemists, Ford Aerospace chairman Geoff Ford and NorthStar Ventures director Ian Richards.
