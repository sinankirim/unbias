Shares Get daily news by email How Brexit will affect your money, holidays, job, savings and pensions \nSo we are out of the EU - but what about our money? \nThe markets are in mayhem, billions have vanished and the pound is plummeting to levels not seen since 1985. \nSome fear we are on course for a financial crash, while others - particularly in the Leave camp - remain upbeat about our future. \nNorth East UKIP MEP Jonathan Arnott described the result of Thursday’s referendum as a “tremendous day for Britain”. \nBut on the flip side, it has the potential to impact on your holiday cash, house price and interest rates. \nHere, we look at how it might hit you in the pocket. The pound \nMost experts seem to think the value of the pound will take a fair hit in the short to medium term. It has already been down 10%, to its lowest level since 1985, since the vote result came through. \nBut what could that mean? Many financial experts believe buying goods or services from other countries will become more expensive now, meaning inflation will be higher. \nThe good we sell to other countries could become cheaper for those buying. Your mortgage \nBank of England governor Mark Carney has already warned of “some market and economic volatility”. \nOne possibility is rising interest rates. That would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay. The Treasury forecast a rise of between 0.7% and 1.1% in borrowing costs, with the Prime Minister claiming the average cost of a mortgage could increase by up to £1,000 a year. \nEqually, this type of activity could lead to landlords increasing rents. \nHowever, it’s not that straightforward. If Brexit causes a severe shock to the UK economy, the Bank of England might have to consider a cut in rates. In which case, the cost of lending could actually fall. Your house price \nEven before the vote, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was warning that Brexit could cause a sharp drop in house prices. \nThe Treasury has said house prices could be hit by between 10% and 18% over the next two years, compared to where they otherwise would have been. \nSo, what does this mean? It could be good news for first-time buyers, but not so great for existing homeowners. \nThe National Association of Estate Agents (NAEA) believes house prices could fall by £2,300 outside of London. But since it expects prices to continue rising anyway, this means a slower rate of increase, rather than a fall in real values. Your job \nThousands of North East jobs are reliant on our trade with Europe, so what happens now? \nLord Peter Mandelson told us just days ago that the impact of Brexit would risk many jobs reliant on that trade. \nSeveral experts have predicted that the economic shock of leaving the EU would cause unemployment to rise in the UK. That would reduce the pressure for wage growth. \nThe Treasury estimated that wages will be between 2.8% and 4% lower at the point of maximum impact, with a typical worker at least £780 a year worse off. \nHowever, don’t start panicking just yet. The UK will remain a member of the EU for at least another two years, and predicting economic performance in two years’ time is pretty tough. Your summer holiday \nOk, so it’s quite possible that a fall in the value of the pound will make holidays to the EU more expensive, as we will have to pay more for accommodation priced in Euros. \nDavid Cameron claimed that a holiday for four people for eight nights will cost £230 extra, as a result of sterling’s devaluation. \nHowever, the cost of flights would depend on individual airlines, and whether the base price is in pounds or Euros. \nBoth Easyjet and Ryanair have argued that flights will become more expensive, as a result of more restrictive aviation rules. But IAG, the owner of British Airways, has said a UK exit from the EU would not affect its business. Your benefit payments \nA report by the National Institute of Social and Economic Research (Niesr) said some families could lose as much as £2,771 a year. \nHowever, the reality could be somewhat different. \nThe UK’s economic growth will very much depend on the precise nature of trade agreements, and whether the UK will be a member of the European Economic Area (EEA). \nIt may also be that the government decides not to keep its earlier promise to balance the books by 2020, known as the fiscal mandate. This would give it much more leeway to maintain benefit payments at current levels. Your pension \nDuring the referendum campaign, the Prime Minister said the so-called “triple lock” for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. \nAgain, this assumes a poorer economy, and lower national income. \nIf economic performance does deteriorate, the Bank of England could decide on a further programme of quantitative easing (QE), as an alternative to cutting interest rates.
