Comments (10) \nShadow chancellor John McDonnell has warned Brexit campaigners will attempt to ramp up scare-mongering on immigration in the weeks leading up to the EU referendum. \nThe senior Labour politician said UKIP and anti-European Union Tories would try to frighten voters over the issue to win the in/out debate. \nMr McDonnell tonight told a Leicester audience of Labour supporters that he acknowledged the free movement of people through the EU did put pressure on public services but that many of those public services were in turn propped up by immigrants. \nThe Labour frontbencher said: \"They (Brexit campaigners) will try to frighten people based on irrational fears on immigration. \n\"The right always needs a scapegoat. \n\"That's either an institution, like the EU, but what they have got at the moment is an ideal opportunity. \n\"They have an institution they can then link migration to and on the basis of arguments about that and people's fears they can mobilise. \n\"That's what they are doing and if they win the Brexit vote there will be a carnival of reaction in this country. \nHe added: \"Their tails will be up and they will seek to build on that. \n\"What he have got to do is hold them back with rational argument. \n\"We have got to confront the issues of freedom of movement and the issues that migration throws up. \n\"That is about making sure that when we have freedom of information we recognise the benefits and we tackle the disbenefits. \n\"The pressure on our public services - we have to acknowledge that takes place when you have movement of people. \n\"How do we tackle it? \n\"We invest in those public services. \n\"How do we invest in public services? \n\"We make sure there is a fair taxation system whereby the rich and the multi-nationals pay their way. \n\"That gives us the resources to invest in our economy, grow the economy and then we can afford the public services that we need.\" \nRead more: Newsagent sentenced after selling 'legal highs' which contained illegal substances \nMr McDonnell, speaking at the NSPCC Centre Training Centre in Beaumont Leys alongside Leicester West MP Liz Kendall, shadow Europe minister Pat Glass, and Alex Scrivener of Global Justice Now, admitted he had been Euro-sceptic for 30 years and said the EU was undemocratic. \nHowever he said the British economy had been mismanaged by the Tories and was in too fragile a state to deal with the shock of leaving. \nHe claimed Brexit would trigger recession and prolonged austerity affecting the working poor and allow the Government to \"tear up\"workers' rights guaranteed by the EU. \nMr McDonnell argued it was better to remain in the EU and attempt to reform it. \nHe accused the Tories of dragging the recent debate into the intellectual gutter. \nHe said: \"There has been criticism in recent media saying the Labour message hasn't got across but most of the media coverage in the last few weeks has been about the bitter struggles that have taken place within the Conservative Party. \n\"They have transferred gang warfare from the Eton dormitories onto our nation political scene and it has been demeaning. \n\"This is a huge, immense decision we have take as a country and Johnson, Cameron, Osborne and all the others take more interest in the future leadership of the Tory party than they do about the future leadership of our country.\" \nMr McDonnell said he wanted a fairer, more democratic European Union to tackle trans-national issues like climate change. \nHe said cutting the UK off from the EU would not bring greater democracy or sovereignty. \nHe said: \"Don't think that by withdrawing we will suddenly have sovereignty on a scale we have never seen before. \n\"There are 92 people in the House of Lords who are only there because Charles II slept with their granny at some time in the future (sic).\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-06-02T00:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-06-16T04:12:55.715+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
