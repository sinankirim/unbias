Those highlighting immigration were more likely to vote for Brexit. \nBut the economy (27%) and the UK’s place in the world (23%) were also cited as reasons for voting, with people highlighting both of those issues more likely to want to stay in the EU . \nThe Journal/Panelbase poll also showed how age is likely to affect people’s vote in the referendum, with the Remain side well ahead (by 61% to 32%) in the 18-34 age range, but behind in the 34-55 group (by 51% to 40%) and substantially behind (61% to 34%) in the 55+ age range. \nWhen asked on whether they would vote, people wanting to leave the EU were slightly more likely to say they would definitely vote on June 23, but not by a large margin. \nSteve Turner, Vote Leave regional director, said: “The North East stands to gain so much when we Vote Leave. We can be a more outward looking region with the means to invest in our own priorities, increase trade outside of the EU and recruit the skilled people we need to grow our industries. \n“The social and economic costs of the EU model are holding our region back from achieving its potential in the world.” \nBut Guy Opperman, Hexham MP and a Remain campaigner, said: “Polls go up and polls go down. The fact of the matter is that we are fighting for every single vote in this referendum. \n“It is vital for the North East that we secure a Remain vote on June 23 because the stakes could not be higher. The highly-respected Institute for Fiscal Studies found that leaving Europe would leave a £40bn black hole in the public purse while HM Treasury estimates that 20,000 jobs in the North East would be lost. \n“Vote Leave has not made a compelling case on the economy and we know that a British exit from the world’s largest trading bloc would mean taking a dangerous path, for the UK’s finances and for the future of this region.” \nThe Journal/Panelbase poll is being published with three weeks to go until the referendum. \nCampaigning yesterday saw Prime Minister David Cameron highlighting the environmental benefits of remaining in the EU while a group of prominent artists, including Angel of the North sculptor Antony Gormley, issued art works backing the Remain side. \nBut Vote Leave campaigners were again highlighting concerns around immigration while one of their chief economists attempted to challenge claims that Brexit would harm the economy. \nThose surveyed in The Journal/Panelbase poll thought the country would be better able to handle terrorism and climate change if it stayed in the union. \nBut they thought the economy, immigration and the refugee crisis would be better handled if the country voted to go it alone. \nThe results of the poll were based on online responses from 505 people in the North East weighted for age and gender to be representative of the population nationally. It was carried out by Hexham-based Panelbase.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-06-03T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-06-03T06:20:05.958+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
