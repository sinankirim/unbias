Hiroaki Nakanishi, CEO of Hitachi \n“This was only possible because Britain was inside the EU; and so the UK car industry was revived and became an exporter again. From Japan, this incredible success story looks like a huge gain from the UK’s membership of the EU. \n“We worry because those advocating Brexit have no answer to how the UK could negotiate cost-free access to this huge market from a position outside it. \n“It would take a long time and result in uncertain market conditions; during this renegotiation period, investors would probably be waiting to see the outcomes, hold back on investment, and jobs would be lost. This is the cold economic reality of Brexit.” 08:39 Daniel Milligan Brexit Hitachi warning from Cameron \nHitachi’s warning that quitting the European Union could force it to rethink plans to invest in the North East is “incredibly powerful”, David Cameron has insisted. \nThe Prime Minister echoed the comments in the House of Commons after Hitachi chairman Hiroaki Nakanishi said that a decision to leave the EU on June 23 made the case for future investment “very different”. PA Wire \nThe huge multinational company is one of the region’s fastest-growing employers and will soon employ more than 700 people at its Newton Aycliffe manufacturing site, making new trains for the East Coast, Great Western and Scotrail lines. \nMr Cameron, who is urging voters to support remaining in the EU, told the House of Commons that leaving would be bad for the economy of the North East. \nHe said: “One of the reasons why international companies like Hitachi invest in Britain - of course we have excellent labour relations, the English language, a very hard working workforce, great engineers - but they also invest here because we are members of the single market. \n“And I thought what the head of Hitachi said this week about wanting us to be the European headquarters, to manufacture trains in the North East and sell them all over Europe, and how that might not be possible if we were to leave, was an incredibly powerful statement.” \nHe added: “So in my clear view jobs come first, and if people want to vote for jobs they should vote for remain on June 23.” 08:30 Daniel Milligan Prime Minister at Hitachi Rail \nDavid Cameron will be in the North East on Thursday to push home his case for Britain remaining in the EU. \nThe Prime Minister will visit Hitachi Rail in Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, to deliver a speech to workers ahead of June 23’s referendum. \nSpeaking ahead of his visit, Mr Cameron warned a Brexit would mean firms such as the Japanese rail giant wouldn’t invest in the region. \nHe echoed the comments in the House of Commons after Hitachi chairman Hiroaki Nakanishi said that a decision to leave the EU made the case for future investment “very different”. \nMr Cameron, who is urging voters to support the remain campaign, said that leaving would be bad for the economy of the North East. \nFollow live updates from Mr Cameron’s visit below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-06-09T10:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-06-09T11:10:40.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
