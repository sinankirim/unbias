If you don’t register by midnight on Tuesday June 7, old people will decide your future. \n“It is vital you take part in this once-in-a-generation vote because this is your tomorrow, you will be most affected by the outcome. \nAccording to Bite the Ballot, a campaigning group urging young people to get involved in politics, people aged 18-24 are twice as likely not to be signed up to vote than the rest of the public. \nThis is important, campaigners say, because the group has different concerns which should be represented. \nBite the Ballot research suggests that the most important issue for under 30s when discussing Brexit was the impact leaving might have on health, with immigration and housing close second and third. \nA survey conducted by pollsters Opinium, for the Observer, found that in the 18-34 age group, 53% of people backed staying in, against 29% who wanted to leave. \nBut only just over half (52%) in this age group said they were certain to actually go out and vote.
