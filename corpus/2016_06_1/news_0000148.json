As we have seen since Thursday, those divisions have now widened, and have resulted in a constitutional crisis, and a growing economic crisis for the nation due to uncertainty over the terms of Brexit. \n“Whilst the Tory Party is entrenched in their own internal conflict, and as people are waking up to the fact that they have been betrayed with lies particularly in relation to additional NHS funding.

For this reason it is essential that the Labour Party is united, with everyone standing shoulder to shoulder and speaking up for the very people who so desperately need us, especially in the North East. \n“The country is looking to the Labour Party to set out a way forward but we need to be united to do this. \n“This should be our sole focus in the coming days, and weeks instead of creating divisions, let us come together to find a way forward.” \nMr Morris added: “I am disappointed that those members of the Parliamentary Labour Party who have in truth never supported Jeremy have used the Referendum as an excuse to move against him in an effort to destabilise the party at this vital juncture. \n“I believe the attack on Jeremy Corbyn is misjudged, mistimed and indulgent. After the Referendum result, it is vital that our Labour MPs return to their constituencies to begin to heal the dangerous fault lines that have split poorer working class communities and not be hidden away in the corridors of Westminster plotting against an elected leader with an overwhelming mandate.” More on the EU Referendum", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-06-27T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-06-27T20:50:36.629+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
