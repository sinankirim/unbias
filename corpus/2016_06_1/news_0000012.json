who was appearing at a football clinic for children in Tenerife along with his brother Sammy, who plays for Team Northumbria - has also revealed he has not had time to digest the next that Britain will leave the European Union. \nPost-Brexit, Perez would have been one of the nine current Magpies who United would have likely been unable to sign. \nUnder current employment rules, any player with an EU passport is free to play in the UK without restriction, while those from outside Europe must meet specific Home Office criteria which depends on how many international appearances they have made and where their country sits in the FIFA rankings. \nThat EU legislation allowed United to snap up Perez for just £1.5million from Tenerife two summers ago. \nAsked about Britain’s decision to leave the EU and how it could impact on his career, Perez replied: “I heard about, I have received some news about it, but being here on my vacation, it is not the time to dwell on that matter. \n“What has to happen will happen. \n“I do not know [if it will impact on my future]. \n“I do not want to think too much about what will happen, only training. \n“I have not had a chance to discuss the matter with my teammates.” NUFC transfers -
