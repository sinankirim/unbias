currently enshrined by FIFA - may be revoked, though that would hand greater opportunity to homegrown youngsters. \nYet as the pound loses value, transfer fees for foreign stars could rise and the freedom to sign them could become more difficult. \nEU passport holders are able to work in other EU countries without restriction. \nBut crossing European borders requires footballers to obtain a work permit from the Home Office which is issued based on the number of international caps they have won over the previous 24 months, and on where their nation is ranked by FIFA. \nAnd following the decision to sever ties with Europe, a report has revealed that 108 current Premier League players lack the necessary requirements to have completed their transfers had they attempted to do so with Britain outside the union. \nThat group includes some key figures - M’Vila, Kirchhoff, Borini, Mannone, Kaboul and Van Aanholt, none of whom have been regular internationals over the past two years - in Sunderland’s successful battle against relegation last season. \nUnder-performing Lens and Toivonen would also have been unable to join the Black Cats. \nHowever, such players are not about to be booted out of British football, with rules not set to be implemented retrospectively. \nAnd experts believe players from EU countries will still be able to come to British clubs on the basis of a soon-to-be-contrived ‘favoured’ status.
