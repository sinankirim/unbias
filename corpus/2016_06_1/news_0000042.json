X \nCopy link to paste in your message / Comments (15) \nSenior figures from Labour, the Lib Dems and the Green Party have been setting out the case for Britain to remain in the European Union. \nLiz Kendall was joined by former minister Vince Cable and Green MP Caroline Lucas today at a Leading not Leaving EU event. \nSir Vince, who served as Secretary of State business innovation and skills under the Lib Dem/Tory Coalition there could be a 'bloody and messy divorce should Britain vote to quit the EU on June 23. \nHe said there was no guarantee of trade deals with European countries following Brexit. \nHe said: \"We don't know how soon a set of alternative arrangements could be reached or what they would look like.\" \nRead more: £2.2 million plan to reopen Leicester's disused Haymarket Theatre as arts venue \nMs Kendall, Leicester West MP, echoed him saying: \"There is not a single credible organisation that thinks we will be better off if we left the EU. \nShe told the largely pro-EU audience, at St Martin's House near the cathedral: \"We are in the fight of our lives. \n\"The decision we take on June 23 will define the future of our country, our economy, our jobs, our safety and security, our role in the world.\" \nShe said the central argument of the Brexit campaign was that the country would have more power and control outside the EU. \nShe said: \"I couldn't disagree more. \n\"In a world that's more connected than ever before real control, the power to shape our destiny, comes by working with our neighbours and allies to get the best for the British people.\" \nShe said Brexit only offered the mirage of greater control. Read more: £175 million cost of reopening Leicester to Burton rail passenger services 'poor value for money' \nMs Lucas, a former MEP and Green Party leader, said the referendum was more important than a general election which could be undone in four or five years because its implications would last for generations \nShe said immigration was being used as a scapegoat to cover for years of under-investment in public services. \nShe also said vital issues like climate change and environmental degradation were cross border issues while stressing the role she said the EU had played in preserving peace since the world wars in the 20th century. \nAnuja Prashar, executive treasurer of the European Movement UK made up the panel and spoke of her fears about how immigration was being misrepresented by the Brexit campaign.
