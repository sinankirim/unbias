Vote Remain!” \nThe campaigners fear leaving the EU would significantly damage young people’s futures, compared to older generations. \nThe stunt was organised by Students for Europe, who also displayed banners at six other cities across the country. \nClifford Fleming, the group’s national coordinator, said: “The consequences of a Brexit will disproportionately affect young people. \n“The economic impact will hit our jobs, freedom of movement will be curtailed and the funding provided to universities will run dry. \n“I’m part of a generation that already faces a lifetime with less wealth than my parents. \n“It would be a generational catastrophe if our grandparents end up voting us out.” \nFergal McFerran, president of the national union of students in Northern Ireland, claims the EU had been a “dynamic force for good”. \nHe said: “The decision that will be taken on June 23rd will have implications for decades to come. \n“The generation to which I belong, as well as those coming after us has the most to lose in the event of a withdrawal from the EU.” \nPercy de Vries, a politics and international relations student at the University of Exeter said: “A loss of opportunities and the ability to guarantee our well-being in the future are the implications of a Brexit. We risk losing the opportunity for us to be able to live, work or study anywhere within 28 countries. \n“The fact that this is the world’s largest economic zone granting us a large market to work and live in. \n“The EU also looks out for us in the long term by protecting our environment.” \nHowever, Leave campaigners have said that Brexit would not deter EU students from applying to British universities. \nJamie Martin, a Brexit campaigner and former government education advisor, said: “This would create a windfall for universities that could be spent on scholarships for the brightest or help for students from poorer backgrounds.” The European Union debate", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-06-20T13:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-06-20T13:59:59.659+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
