David Cheskin/PA Wire Sir John Chilcot, chairman of the Iraq inquiry \nIt’s not like he faces jail time as a result of the Chilcot report or its findings no matter how damning. And the comments of Blair or his friends have got me wondering how damning it will actually turn out to be. \nIt’s a well used political tactic to preview a report bleakly which is then not so bad when it actually sees the light of day. But time will tell. \nWhilst Chilcot has been working on his report since 2009, Blair has not been short of work himself, earning shed loads of cash thanks to jobs including that of the irony defining Middle East peace envoy. \nHe has also of late been doing his bit for the Brexit campaign by becoming a very visible part of the Remain camp. \nHow many ‘undecided’ people out there have seen Blair’s orange mug on the TV exhorting them to Remain in the EU and decided ‘Leave’ - and now. \nAs an aside, Blair has spent a lot of time slagging Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn , recently comparing his own politics of ‘power’ to the politics of ‘protest’ of Corbyn. \nCorbyn has not risen to the bait, although he is expected to issue a heartfelt apology from the Labour party to the British people about the Iraq war after the Chilcot report is published. I can’t wait to hear what the friends of Blair make of that one.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-06-11T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-06-11T17:42:43.303+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
