chairman of £250m Midlands Engine fund X \nCopy link to paste in your message / Midlands Engine fund chairman Nick Pulley Loughborough Science and Enterprise Park Comments (0) \nA Government initiative to attract inward investment and create hundreds of thousands of jobs in the Midlands has taken a step closer to achieving its goal with another high level appointment. \nNick Pulley, regional director for Santander Corporate and Commercial, has been named chairman of the £250 million Midlands Engine Investment Fund. \nHis appointment follows news that Sir John Peace, the Lord Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire who founded Experian, is taking over as chairman of the Midlands Engine initiative. \nSir John, who is also chairman of both the Standard Chartered Bank and Burberry Group, will lead the Midlands partnership which aims to drive up productivity and growth across the Midlands. \nBusiness Secretary Sajid Javid first outlined plans for the Midlands Engine in December 2015. \nThe aim is to create 300,000 jobs and generate an additional £34 billion for the local economy by 2030. \nRead more : Santander Bank warns Brexit could put economy at risk \nThe Government's stated objective is for the investment fund to be used \"by backing even more growing businesses and creating thousands of new jobs throughout the region\". \nMr Pulley, who is also chairman of the Leicester and Leicestershire Enterprise Partnership, said the fund is an amalgamation of funding from the 11 LEPs across the region, together with a loan of around £90 million from the European Investment Bank. \nHe said: \"I think we can make a real difference. \n\"We have sponsorship from central government, plus all 86 local authorities in the region have reached agreement to work together, which is no small thing.\" \nHe said the fund will provide loans for a wide range of businesses, ranging from university start-ups at a proof-of-concept stage, to SMEs looking for growth capital to take their businesses to the next stage. \nMr Pulley said: \"We will be working with other funding organisations, so the interest rates we will charge are unlikely to be lower. \n\"The idea is not to compete with banks and other funding institutions but to fill the gap for companies who may otherwise be at too early a stage to obtain funding.\" \nThe British Business Bank, which is looking after the fund, is about to appoint fund managers in the region who will report to Mr Pulley's board. \nRead more: Leicester Business Festival to return \nLoans from the fund are likely to be available in the fourth quarter of this year. \nMr Pulley said: \"Our target is to get it launched to market by the turn of the year and our aim is to make applying for funding as least proscriptive as possible and keep it as broad as possible. And we hope to make the application process as slick as possible. \n\"We will use the LLEP Business Gateway as a shop window to point businesses looking for funding in the right direction. \n\"It is for businesses to come forward and I imagine the fund will get used up pretty quickly. \n\"The fund is well progressed and is on track to be launched in the fourth quarter. \n\"We want the Midlands to punch above its weight both nationally and internationally and I think we should be optimistic. \n\"By the East Midlands and West Midlands working together we will collectively achieve a major change for the region.\" \nMr Pulley and Sir John will be supported by a strategic supervisory group composed of representatives from local authorities, business and universities.
