Well, it would have meant the likes of Ayoze Perez, Vurnon Anita and Tim Krul would not have been eligible to sign for the Magpies. \nIt also means the likes of Manu Riviere, Gabriel Obertan and Siem de Jong wouldn’t have been eligible either. \nHere’s a rundown of the nine Newcastle players who played in the Premier League last season who would not have been eligible to sign for their clubs had Britain not been in the EU when they joined.
