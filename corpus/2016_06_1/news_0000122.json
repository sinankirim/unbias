It would be a tragedy and loss to all see this reversed.” \nThe Bishop’s intervention has come as Remain campaigners claimed businesses in the North East would be hit with an ‘export tax’ of £900m if the UK left the EU Single Market. \nResearch commissioned by the Britain Stronger in Europe group said the average business exporting to the EU would be faced with additional costs of nearly £80,000 in “non-tariff” trade barriers if the UK was outside the single market. \nThe extra costs would include having to submit customs declarations, waiting for products to clear inspections and the need to adapt products to different standards. \nA Vote Leave spokesperson said: “This referendum is a decision for all North Easterners – it’s their opportunity to take back control of the region’s destiny. Every year the North East sends £496m to the EU. Just imagine what we could do with this money to benefit our families, communities and businesses. \n“Voters are not interested in scaremongering, and that’s why we’re making sure people know about the positive future we have if we Vote Leave on June 23.” The European Union debate", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-06-07T02:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-06-07T03:55:01.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
