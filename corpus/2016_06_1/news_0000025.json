John Giles/PA Wire Ron Hogg, the police and crime commissioner for Durham \nThey highlighted the importance of the European Arrest Warrant, which is an arrest warrant valid throughout the European Union - making it much easier for one member state to arrest a suspect and send them to another country where they are wanted by police. \nAnd they also warned that leaving the EU in the referendum on June 23 would mean the UK has to leave Europol, the cross-border agency which fights serious international organised crime. \nThe PCCs said: “Over the last five years, more than 5,000 people have been extradited from the UK on a European Arrest Warrant. That number includes more than 200 alleged killers and rapists and a number of suspected terrorists. \n“In return, police in the UK have received almost 650 people that they wanted to bring before the courts, including 51 alleged killers.” \nThey added: “Terrorist networks, gangs and cybercriminals operate across borders and are difficult to monitor, which is why firm and coordinated international action is needed to destroy them.” \nIt comes with fewer than four weeks to go before the historic vote which will decide whether the UK stays in the EU or quits. \nCleveland Police Crime Commissioner, Barry Coppinger \nSupporters of membership highlighted a new report which predicts 100,000 UK manufacturing jobs will be created by the EU’s single market if we remain a member. \nNew analysis by the Centre for Economics and Business Research said there are currently almost 950,000 UK manufacturing jobs linked to EU trade, including 41,000 in the North East. \nAnd it predicted more than 5,600 new manufacturing jobs could be created in the region by 2030 if the UK stays in the EU, due to the deepening of the single market. \nLeading UK manufacturers are also launching an unprecedented warning about the future of UK manufacturing. The heads of three of our biggest manufacturing companies - Siemens, Airbus and GKN - will share a platform and say investment and jobs will be at risk if Britain leaves the EU. \nSiemens is a major North East employer, with sites in Newcastle and Hebburn , Tyne and Wear. PA Wire Prime Minister David Cameron \nThe business leaders will appear together at an event to warn that future UK manufacturing jobs would be at risk if Britain leaves the EU single market because new trade barriers will see investment decisions going to other countries. \nJuergen Maier, chief executive of Siemens UK, is set to say: “Being outside the EU will count against the UK when investment decisions are made and we would miss out on fantastic future opportunities and the jobs and economic prosperity that go with them.” \nCampaigners who want the UK to leave the European Union have focused on immigration. \nThey challenged Prime Minister David Cameron to come clean and admit that there was no way Britain could take back control of its borders without leaving the EU. \nA letter signed by leading Conservative “Brexit” campaigners Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, and Labour MP Gisela Stuart, said: “Voters were promised repeatedly at elections that net immigration could be cut to the tens of thousands. This promise is plainly not achievable as long as the UK is a member of the EU and the failure to keep it is corrosive of public trust in politics.” \nAnd it warns: “A vote to remain is a vote to maintain permanently the EU Treaty principle of ‘free movement of people’. A vote to remain is a vote to ensure that we must admit economic migrants from the EU, whether or not they have a job offer.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-06-01T10:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-06-01T11:20:12.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
