The Conservative Government has an effective majority of 17. \nBritain's Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne (L) and former Chancellor Alistair Darling attend a pro-Remain event at the Hitachi Rail Europe plant on June 15, 2016 in Ashford, England \nAnd the statement makes it clear Conservative MPs are ready to force Mr Osborne out of office, warning his position would be “untenable” if he tried to carry out his plans. \nThe statement said: “It is absurd to say that if people vote to take back control from the EU that he would want to punish them in this way. \n“We do not believe that he would find it possible to get support in Parliament for these proposals to cut the NHS, our police forces and our schools.” \nIt continued: “If he were to proceed with these proposals, the Chancellor’s position would become untenable. This is a blatant attempt to talk down the market and the country. \n“The Chancellor risks doing damage to the British economy in his bid to win this political campaign.” \nMrs Trevelyan, who is supporting the Leave campaign, said: “The key point is that we passed a law not to put up taxation this Parliament, so this sort of scaremongering budget is nonsensical. \n“I hope that people vote on June 23 on the basis of getting back control of our taxation, sovereignty and protecting our democracy.” \nBut a defiant Mr Osborne insisted he would have no choice but to act to prevent “chaos” in the public finances and “huge” economic instability. \n“No Conservative wants to raise taxes - least of all me,” he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. \n“But, equally, Conservatives understand - and, indeed, I suspect many Labour politicians understand - that you cannot have chaos in your public finances. \n“You have to deal with the hole that would emerge if we quit the EU and we would have to take the necessary measures. \n“The Conservative Government would do what was needed to deal with huge instability in our economy and, of course, the chaos in the public finances.” \nHis planned emergency budget was published jointly with Alistair Darling, the former Labour Chancellor , and appears to be a response to opinion polls suggesting the leave campaign could win the referendum. \nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn is backing calls to remain in the EU, but appeared to condemn the Chancellor’s plans as he told the House of Commons that Labour would vote against any “austerity budget”. \nLabour has its own divisions over Europe, after senior figures including Deputy Leader Tom Watson said a future Labour or Conservative Government should attempt to end unrestricted free movement of people in the EU and convince other countries to support restrictions on immigration. \nMr Corbyn appears to disagree, telling website Buzzfeed he would “absolutely” defend the EU’s rules on free movement of workers. \nHe said: “It’s intrinsic to the European Union that there has to be free movement of people.” The European Union debate", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-06-15T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-06-15T21:34:34.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
