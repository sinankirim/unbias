firms to rally together to secure the best deal for the North East Shares Get business news by email George Rafferty \nCompanies across the North East have declared UK’s decision to leave the EU as a pivotal turning point – but are determined it should be “business as usual” with international links maintained and strengthened. \nAnd as the business community digested news of the Prime Minister’s resignation, business leaders said cementing the region’s position within the Northern Powerhouse was now more vital than ever. \nGeorge Rafferty, chief executive of NOF Energy, said: “The innovation of the UK energy sector supply chain is in demand from international markets across the globe, including Europe, and companies will work to maximise the export opportunities the evolving political landscape will present.” Ben Staerck of Furniture Clinic \nBen Staerck, managing director of Furniture and Handbag Clinic, based in Burnopfield , said the decision to leave the EU will no doubt bring about change, but that it would be business as usual for the company. \nHe said: “Nevertheless, we will still continue to operate as normal, export our products to countries within the EU, and expand into Europe, as planned.” \nMohammed Bashir, owner of Boro Taxis, said: “Building the Northern Powerhouse is now more important than ever as we plan for a future outside the EU.” Chief Executive for NE1 Ltd Sean Bullick \nSean Bullick, chief executive of Newcastle’s BID company NE1 Ltd, called for Government clarity and stability. \nHe said: “The people of the UK have spoken and now Government and business must rally together to secure the best possible deal for the North East and the UK as a whole. Our primary concern is for the Government to provide clarity and stability for both the region’s exporters and also central Government funding mechanisms that will replace the existing EU funds.” \nSimon Bailes of Teesside motor retailers Simon Bailes Peugeot said: “The vote is over and a decision has been made. We have an opportunity to shape the future that we must grasp with both hands.” \nGareth Thomas, managing director of Stockton-based Icon Plastics, meanwhile, said the UK must now plan for the future, adding: “I’d like to see a new budget from the Chancellor to limit economic damage.” \nChris McDonald, CEO, Materials Processing Institute, in Middlesbrough, said: “The materials Processing Institute will continue to cooperate with its global partners as we build on our wide international networks. \n“The institute is already recognised as a world-leader in materials and steel innovation with international interest in our expertise continuing to grow and we can confidently rely on this to secure global research collaborations for our UK industry partners. \n“We look forward to building and strengthening the relationships we have formed with industrialists within and outside the European Union. On-going international collaboration is essential to the future interests of British industry.” Lisa Eaton \nLisa Eaton, director of Newcastle creative agency Unwritten Creative, said: “This is a brave and bold decision to leave the EU and one which we must all get behind, regardless of how we chose to vote independently. \n“We should embrace the decision as it’s likely to be the biggest change the UK will experience in our generation. For me, it brings about a sense of comradery; we now have the opportunity to take control and make a real difference to the United Kingdom. If we focus and work together we can become a stronger community. \n“We now need to invest in our businesses and although Brexit wasn’t favoured by all of the business leaders in the country, it doesn’t have to be seen as a negative. We are walking into the unknown, and with that, can sometimes come fear, but we must all stick together and focus on how we are going shape the future of this great nation.” Mark Hatton, from Ernst and Young, in Newcastle \nMark Hatton, senior partner for EY in the North East, said the initial impact of the vote to leave the EU will not be felt straight away as we will still be full members, but the impact will be felt longer term. \n“Although we may start to see investments being delayed, M&A put on hold, and possibly a decline in job mobility,” he said. \n“The longer term picture however is where we expect most impact. Businesses across the region must use the next few months to assess their position in terms of trade, migration and regulation. Europe is a significant investor in the North East, as our recent UK Attractiveness Survey shows, in particular from France and Germany. \n“Organisations need to assess their access to markets, exports and imports and the relevant impact on their supply chains too. Access to skilled staff will be high up the agenda for some sectors. \n“Changes in regulation are possible, which may impact on standards and future investment. Government policy is also highly relevant, for instance, in terms of taxation, EU research funding and potential use of state aid by UK Government to back selected sectors. \n“We do not know the exact changes that we will be facing over the coming years, but this time can be well-spent by strengthening current positions and relationships, planning for the most-likely scenarios and looking out for new opportunities that will come.” \nGavin Black, partner at North East property consultancy Gavin Black & Partners and chairman of the G9 group of chartered surveyors, feels too many people voted with their hearts at a time when there is political upheavel across the world. \n“Perhaps trends will be clearer with the French general elections later this year and the German elections early next year,” he said. \n“Meanwhile we need to look at regional issues such as Grant Aid. If it will take two years to exit the EU will the EU grant aid over a five year timescale? I suspect not in which case wil the UK government step in? \n“We need to think carefully about Nissan and its supporting supply chain. There is very significant employment here. \n“The EU started life as an economic union. This result is an expression of concerns over a political union of 28 countries with more to come. If it had retained the economic union perhaps the outcome would have been different.” \nFellow property firm Bilfinger GVA, which has a strong North East presence, said we could expect negative impact on trade volumes, foreign direct investment levels, exchange rates and borrowing costs. \nGerry Hughes, Chief Executive of the firm, said: “The decision of the electorate to leave the European Union presents a significant market challenge. Whilst any attempt to quantify the effect of the ‘leave’ vote remains speculative, the impact will undoubtedly be felt across all areas of our economy. \n“Nevertheless, despite the economic uncertainly this decision creates, our advisory offer provides a stable platform from which to assist our clients in adjusting to this new market dynamic.” \n“What is certain in the short term is that we will see a negative impact on trade volumes, foreign direct investment levels, exchange rates and borrowing costs. It is vital therefore that Government moves decisively to set out how the UK navigates through this new economic landscape, and so allows us to reach a more certain and stable outlook in the medium to long term.” James Ramsbotham, chief executive of the NEECC \nMeanwhile, the North East England Chamber of Commerce said it must now reassure the region’s businesses in the wake of the result. \nJames Ramsbotham, chief executive of the NEECC, said: “A significant number of our members are worried about the impact of leaving. The focus for us now is to ensure these business concerns are addressed. It is vital the Government ensures minimal disruption to trade and investment as the process of change begins. \n“We also need to see measures to reassure businesses on issues such as access to overseas talent and the future of regional funding streams. \n“We have an export record which is the strongest in the whole country and this must not be compromised as the decision to leave becomes a reality. The Government must now secure the best possible ongoing relationship with Europe and the rest of the world to enable sustained business growth in our region.” More on the EU Referendum", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-06-24T11:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-06-24T12:01:52.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
