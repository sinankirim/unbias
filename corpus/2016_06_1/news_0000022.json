X \nCopy link to paste in your message / Comments (0) \nLeicestershire's biggest employers are preparing for tough months ahead after Britain voted to leave the EU. \nHundreds of millions of pounds was wiped off the value of county companies following the Brexit vote and David Cameron's announcement he was planning to step aside. \nShares in Coalville housebuilder Barratt Developments were down 23 per cent at 442p yesterday afternoon amid market fears the property market would slow. \nIt meant the company was worth £4.4 billion – £1.3 billion down on Thursday. \nNext Plc lost around £800 million in its market value – as shares dropped 12 per cent. \nShares in Topps Tiles, of Enderby were down 10 per cent, Dunelm, of Syston was down 12 per cent and brick maker Ibstock was down 20 per cent. \nBrexit winner Boris Johnson in Ashby on Wednesday \nDigger maker Caterpillar UK, which has around 1,500 people in Desford, remained committed to Britain however. \nUK director Mark Dorsett urged the government and Europe to negotiate new trade settlements as swiftly as possible. \nHe said: \"The UK is an intrinsic part of our European supply chain and we urge all parties to reach an agreement that quickly removes the uncertainty, allows the UK to retain full access to and from the single market and protects the interests of businesses with strong commitments and investments in the UK.\" \nJohn Browett, chief executive of homeware store chain Dunelm, saw Brexit as \"an opportunity\" as shoppers looked for better deals. \nHe said: \"There will be a little bit of uncertainty and turmoil around this, but our business is all about value for money and what we've seen in uncertain times is people look for more value, so we actually did well in the last recession as a consequence. \n\"What tends to happen in these markets is that we are able to expand a little faster. \n\"We want to open another 50 or so stores and in this environment it is a little bit easier for us because there are less people chasing the real estate.\" \nScott Knowles, chief executive of East Midlands Chamber, said the UK needs to be stronger than ever to prepare for the coming years outside the EU. \nHe said: \"One of the biggest fears expressed during the campaign was that we would have no international trade deals in place once we leave the EU. \n\"It is essential that Government begins negotiations immediately to establish trade deals which are in the best interests of UK plc.\" \nNorth west Leicestershire haulage business Pall-Ex has spent years building up its operations in Europe. \nThe Ellistown business, which has about 300 staff, overseas a network of haulage firms including the UK, Spain, Portugal, Bulgaria, Romania, Italy, France and Benelux regions. \nManaging director Kevin Buchanan said imports and exports will be \"deeply affected\". \nHe said: \"As a business, we've always said that Britain is stronger in Europe. \n\"We're saddened that the majority of people didn't share our view. \n\"We stand firm in our belief that the UK's supply chain will be deeply affected by the referendum outcome, as it's always relied on an efficient international logistics network. \n\"Jobs, trade and investment are all likely to be impacted. \n\"Our number one priority has always been, and remains, our haulier members and customers. \n\"Over the coming months, we'll be doing all we can to support them and ensure that, as much as possible, it remains business as usual.\" \nDavid Thomas, chief executive of Barratt Homes was confident demand for new houses would continue. \nHe said: \"We have prepared for this eventuality and whilst we recognise there will be a period of uncertainty as the UK's exit is negotiated, the strong fundamentals of our business are unchanged. \n\"There is an undersupply of quality homes in the UK, and we have a clear strategy to address this, supported by a strong balance sheet to execute our growth plans.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-06-24T19:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-06-24T21:42:23.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
