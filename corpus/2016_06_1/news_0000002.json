However, the Newcastle-based scheme allows them to share knowledge with other doctors across Europe. \nHanns Lochmüller, Professor of Experimental Myology at the Newcastle University John Walton Muscular Dystrophy Research Centre and honorary consultant with the Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Trust, said: “EU funding is absolutely vital to our medical research work at Newcastle University. \n“Of course the number of jobs it has brought into the region is substantial, but what is even more important to me and the patients who come to our centre is that it enables us to run world-leading clinical trials for rare muscle-wasting conditions, provide the best care, and develop cutting-edge ways of diagnosing patients who do not know the cause of their disease.” \nAs the EU debate continued, a former leader of Newcastle City Council warned that leaving the EU would be “a massive own goal disrupting our economy and the livelihoods of very many households”. \nJohn Shipley, now a Liberal Democrat member of the House of Lords, said in a speech in Parliament: “The North East would lose access to hundreds of millions of pounds of EU funding for regional development. \n“The North East needs access to the EU single market of 500 million people, with a say over the rules of doing business across Europe. That means more jobs and more financial security for our region.” \nTom Watson MP \nLabour Deputy Leader Tom Watson will today publish a dossier setting out what he says will be the impact of leaving the European Union on family budgets. \nHe will claim that social security cuts and tax rises totalling more than £18bn would be introduced. \nBut there was a boost for the leave campaign as the head of a major British manufacturer said industry would benefit by leaving the EU. \nJCB chairman Lord Bamford, a Tory peer, has written to all JCB employees to explain why he is in favour of quitting the EU. \nThe businessman says he supported joining the Common Market but did not back it turning into a political union. \nStating that more than half of Britain’s trade is with non-EU countries, Lord Bamford warns that the EU has a shrinking share of world trade. \n“No one can be certain of the outcome. One thing I am certain of is this: JCB will continue to trade with Europe irrespective of whether we remain or leave the EU. \n“JCB was selling into Europe long before the UK joined the Common Market in 1973, and it will remain an important market for JCB,” Lord Bamford wrote. \nThe JCB chairman told workers it was up to them how they voted, but they should vote one way or the other in the referendum.
