And their message was clear: “We want facts, not opinions.” \nOne student asked if companies like Hitachi, which has a multi-million pound plant in Newton Aycliffe, would be tempted to leave Britain if people voted for a Brexit on June 23. \nMr Johnson said: “Hitachi have said that they would have to reconsider their investment if we are out of the EU. At the moment there are no tariffs, no barriers and one set of regulations. \n“If you are going to have to pay tariffs, you will want to set up in Europe instead. And it’s not just Hitachi, it’s all the big motor manufacturers. We would lose a big chunk of our economy if we were out of Europe.” \nLilian Greenwood MP, Shadow Transport Secretary and Alan Johnson MP, Chair of the Labour in for Britain campaign \nThere was also a question about the impact on immigration if Turkey was to join the EU. \nMr Johnson said the best way to control immigration was to stay in. \nHe added: “Britain has a veto and every other country in the EU has to agree to Turkey joining the EU. And you can apply terms and conditions. \n“Seventy five million people in Turkey are not going to want to leave and come here. The way to control immigration is to stay within the EU, because we would have no say on it if we were out.” \nAlso read: Still undecided on the EU referendum? Here’s what the key players are saying about it \nHe also said he didn’t think his grandchildren would see Turkey joining the EU in their lifetime. \nHe added: “Out of 35 chapters (to join the EU), only one has been completed and that too has questions over it. There are 34 to go. I doubt if it’s going to happen in our lifetime.” \nStudent Liam Jobes, 19, of West Moor, Newcastle, said he found it useful to speak to the campaigners and was planning to vote to remain. \nHe added: “Throughout this campaign we have been hearing all kinds of things from both the Remain and Leave camps. But we want the facts, not opinions. \n“The main issues for me are employment and education. I think that if we leave, companies like Hitachi might move out of Britain and others might follow suit. We are training for the workplace and there need to be jobs for us in the industry.” \nLilian Greenwood MP, Shadow Transport Secretary and Alan Johnson MP, Chair of the Labour in for Britain campaign \nMP Lilian Greenwood said the college facilities were “really impressive” and emphasised the need for the economy to grow to help provide jobs for “talented, committed and enthused students”. \nShe added: “The North East is an exporting region so it is vital to have access to the European market. \n“In terms of transport and roads, a lot of decisions on infrastructure and spending are made by central Government. But that’s contingent on the success of the UK economy. If we leave, the economy would take a hit and that would inevitably create huge pressures on public spending. I know there’s an aspiration in the North East to really improve roads, bus services and the Metro network, but for that public spending must be maintained.” The European Union debate", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-06-17T08:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-06-17T11:53:36.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
