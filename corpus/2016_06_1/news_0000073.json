VIEW GALLERY \nHowever, Wearside’s economy is bolstered by the Nissan car plant in Washington which employs some 6,700 and the Japanese firm had hinted it could consider leaving if Britain votes to leave the EU. \nThe pound had risen following early polls which suggested a victory for the Remain campaign but after the first two North East results it fell from 1.49 against the dollar to 1.43 as faith in a victory for Remain were immediately dented. \nThe turnout across Britain could be crucial. In Newcastle, it was 67.7% and in Sunderland it was 64.9%. For the last General Election, turnout was 60.3% in Newcastle and 57,2% in Sunderland - a fair jump in both cities. \nWith the Newcastle vote tighter than expected and the Sunderland Leave win bigger than expected - hopes of those who want to leave the EU have had an early boost.
