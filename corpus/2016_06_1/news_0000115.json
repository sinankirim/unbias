He admitted harbouring the hope that the reality of conditions in County Durham would have convinced the population that the Remain vote was necessary. \nHe implied the much-needed figure of £129 million due to for County Durham from the EU in the next few years is now in jeopardy. \nBut he added: “We will have to make sure it still comes to us.” \nIn contrast, UKIP’s Alan Breeze from Bishop Auckland was encouraged by County Durham’s Out vote, alongside the North East’s overwhelming vote for Brexit. \nCalling the referendum “exciting” and “historic times”, he is hopeful that emancipation from the EU will reverse the erosion of UK democracy that he believes the organisation has caused. \nMPs, counting staff, police and press alike made a swift beeline for the exits following the official announcement. \nResults after 0 of 382 areas declared Waiting for the first results Leave: 1,197 votes (50%) As it stands Britain is set to Remain in the EU ", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-06-24T00:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-06-24T19:18:11.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
