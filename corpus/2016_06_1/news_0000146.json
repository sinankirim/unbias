Steve Stills Chancellor George Osborne \nMr Forbes said: “ The Northern Powerhouse was very much George Osborne’s brainchild and it looks as though now the Prime Minister has resigned, his shelf life is coming to an end too. \n“We will have to ask any incoming new Tory Prime Minister - what’s their commitment to devolution? \n“George Osborne was quite unusual in driving the devolution agenda. It’s not something that is natural territory for the Tories.” \nMr Forbes said there is to be a meeting on July 4 of the North East Combined Authority where local authority leaders will have an “informal” talk about the situation. \n“We will be seeking urgent reassurance from the Government that this (Northern Powerhouse) is still on the policy agenda.” Video loading Click to play Tap to play The Live Event you are trying to watch is either unavailable or has not started Please refresh this page in your browser to reload this live event video \nWith the future of Mr Osborne unclear, Mr Forbes said they would be looking to speak to Lord O’Neill, commercial secretary to the Treasury responsible for the Northern Powerhouse, and Communities Minister Greg Clark. \nAmongst a number of issues, he revealed that central to the powerhouse idea was European funding and the local authority control of it, a revenue stream which is soon to close. \n“We will need cast iron assurances it will be replaced,” said Mr Forbes. \nMeanwhile his NECA colleague Iain Malcolm, leader of South Tyneside Council, was equally concerned. \nHe said: “The devolution deal had a part of it from the EU. What happens to that now? And in terms of the Northern Powerhouse, I simply do not know. We want devolution but clearly we need to see what is going to happen. Iain Malcolm of South Tyneside Council \n“We need to see how it unfolds. George Osborne is the driving force behind it but will he remain chancellor? He is the heart of devolution and the economic plan. It’s early days and we need to take stock.” \nIn the run up to the vote Mr Osborne said a Brexit would result in him having to slash public spending and increase taxes in an emergency Budget to tackle a £30bn “black hole”. \nThis was rubbished by Leave campaigners who accused the Chancellor of scaremongering. \nHowever Mr Forbes said: “It worries me deeply. We’ve been punished with six years of austerity and cuts and it’s been extremely difficult. \n“It was partly justified to maintain the UK’s triple A credit rating which is now seriously at risk. All of these years of austerity have been for nothing.” \nIn an interview before the vote, Mr Osborne said the country was likely to go into a recession if it voted Leave, which would “hit the North first and hit it for longer”. James Ramsbotham \nJames Ramsbotham, Chief Executive, of the North East Chamber of Commerce, expressed the thoughts of the business community. \nHe said: “Given at the moment it’s quite unclear if we have an effective government, an effective Prime Minister and an effective Chancellor of the Exchequer, it’s clear that some of the current political initiatives need to be re-evaluated.” \nHowever he said after three months in which major decisions were put on hold in the run up to the referendum vote, the government and the business community has to act fast. \n“Devolution was about transforming our relationship with the rest of the world. One thing we have to do is try and move much more quickly to the next economy. \n“The North East in particular has such potential with regard to exports. Any future government needs to explore how we can maximise that export potential.” \nNorthern Powerhouse Minister and Stockton South MP James Wharton who supported the leave campaign not surprisingly talked up the benefits of Brexit for the region. \nHe said: “It has always been the case that the UK pays far more into the EU than we get back. This gives us a chance to take control of those funds, to have more flexibility about how we support and grow business and to build on the work already being done to transfer powers to local areas which know how to use them best. \nWe will now go through a period of negotiation. We want a good deal and to continue to trade wth the EU, but there is a much bigger world out there and new possibilities are opened up by this decision, which could prove to be the best thing that could have happened for our exporting northern economies.” More on the EU Referendum", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-06-24T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-06-24T15:57:59.759+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
