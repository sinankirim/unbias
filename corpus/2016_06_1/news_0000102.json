People in the North East feel completely left behind and this is voters saying enough is enough. \n“People are desperate. All of us have to get our act together. Instead of blaming immigrants, we need to start putting money into the NHS and realise we need to pay more tax. \n“And in their campaign, they worked immigration to death.” \nGateshead MP Ian Mearns also campaigned to stay inside the EU but saw his constituents reject his calls to back the union. \nHe said: “I anticipated an out vote but not to that level. If we are asking what happened, first and foremost all of the faces we saw in the build-up were in favour of Brexit. I do not think people backing Remain had enough of a hearing. \n“In the North East, people are sick of austerity, they are sick of cuts and they have decided to stick two fingers up to David Cameron and George Osborne. \n“And we can not get away from it, people are worried about immigration.” \nResults after 0 of 382 areas declared Waiting for the first results Leave: 1,197 votes (50%) As it stands Britain is set to Remain in the EU", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-06-24T07:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-06-24T07:44:42.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
