James Ramsbotham, Chief Executive of the North East Chamber of Commerce \nPrime Minister David Cameron announced plans to resign following the ballot, although he continues in office until a replacement Conservative leader is elected. The Tory 1922 Committee, which will oversee the election, has announced that a new party leader - who will become Prime Minister - will be in place by September 2 at the latest. \nMr Ramsbotham praised Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, who delivered a reassuring statement on Friday shortly after the referendum result was announced. \nAnd the Chamber leader said he welcome the Chancellor’s comments, but added:”Although he tried to reassure people by saying there was a plan, I think we’d like to see the details of said plan. \n“What businesses need is to understand what that plan is, how long it might take, and to begin to get a feel of what it might look like.” \nHe said: “Businesses may not like it, but they can cope with anything as long as they know what it is. \n“But if there is a plan, nobody seems to know what it is - or not well enough to communicate it.” \nIn his speech, Mr Osborne insisted: “I want to reassure the British people, and the global community, that Britain is ready to confront what the future holds for us from a position of strength. Chancellor George Osborne \n“That is because in the last six years the government and the British people have worked hard to rebuild the British economy.” \nWhile he had campaigned for a remain vote, everyone had to accept that the public had voted to leave the European Union, Mr Osborne said. \n“The Treasury, the Bank of England, and the Financial Conduct Authority have spent the last few months putting in place robust contingency plans for the immediate financial aftermath in the event of this result.” \nHe said the Treasury and the Prudential Regulation Authority, a Bank of England body which regulates banks, had “worked systematically with each major financial institution in recent weeks to make sure they were ready to deal with the consequences of a vote to leave.” \nMr Osborne added: “It will not be plain sailing in the days ahead, but let me be clear. You should not underestimate our resolve. \n“We were prepared for the unexpected. We are equipped for whatever happens.” \nHe made no direct mention of plans for an “emergency budget” - despite warning during the referendum campaign that a vote for Brexit would force him to raise taxes and cut public spending. \nBut he appeared to hint that some action would be required, saying: “It is already evident that as a result of Thursday’s decision, some firms are continuing to pause their decisions to invest, or to hire people. \n“As I said before the referendum, this will have an impact on the economy and the public finances – and there will need to be action to address that.” \nSterling continued its steep slide against the dollar on Monday as concerns about the British economy deepened. \nThe pound plunged 3.35% against the US currency to 1.32 dollars, following on from Friday’s 10% dive. \nAgainst the euro the pound was also down, falling 2.27% at 1.20 euro. \nMr Osborne’s speech had contributed to a mini-rally early on Monday, but the gains soon evaporated and experts warned that months of uncertainty could see more volatility.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-06-27T18:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-06-27T18:49:33.714+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
