and the UK. Monday \nWith just days to go before the nation voted on whether to quit the European Union , MPs were gathered in Westminster to pay tribute to their colleague Jo Cox following her senseless murder. \nIt was a moving event, viewed from the public gallery by Mrs Cox’s husband, Brendan, and their two tiny children, three-year-old daughter Lejla and son Cuillin, five. Yui Mok/PA Wire Labour MP Jo Cox \nSome Labour MPs were in tears. \nBut while everyone was sincere in their desire to set campaigning aside for the day, the EU referendum battle continued. \nSayeeda Warsi, the former Chair of the Conservative Party, had announced she was switching her allegiance from the “Leave” campaign to “Remain”. \nThe statement prompted mockery from Leave activists, who said they never realised she was on their side to start with. \nBut the reason she gave for switching sides struck a nerve. She said she was appalled by the “hate and xenophobia” of the remain campaign. \nIt followed the publication of a poster by UKIP leader Nigel Farage which showed a queue of people of Arab appearance and the words “Breaking Point”. \nThe poster appeared to suggest that the UK was set to be invaded by hordes of refugees from Syria and elsewhere, and this was somehow the EU’s fault. \nIt was widely condemned as racist. George Osborne , the Chancellor and a Remain campaigner, said it had echoes of 1930s fascist propaganda. \nFor the official Leave campaign - which did not include Mr Farage - it was an embarrassment. Lewis Whyld/PA Wire Justice Secretary Michael Gove \nConservatives Michael Gove and Boris Johnson, and Labour MP Gisela Stuart, were leading the Vote Leave campaign. Mr Farage had gone his own way and joined a separate, unofficial campaign. \nBut that didn’t stop some Remain campaigners from using the poster to suggest that the entire Remain campaign was intolerant, anti-immigrant and perhaps vaguely racist. \nMr Farage complained that his side in the Referendum campaign had been depicted as the “bad guys” following the “isolated, horrific incident” in which Jo Cox was killed, as he spoke at a rally in Gateshead. Tuesday \nThere was a sense that the tide was turning. Opinion polls the previous week had suggested Britain was set to vote to leave the EU - but the Remain campaign was staging an effective fightback. \nPrime Minister David Cameron delivered a speech outside Number 10, but along with other Remain Conservatives he was happy for Labour to grab most of the spotlight. Their thinking was that the key to winning the vote was convincing Labour voters that staying in the EU was in their interest. \nAnd Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn delivered a speech claiming that leaving the EU would lead to a “bonfire of employment rights”. John Linton/PA Wire Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn \nHowever, he also warned that the EU needed reform - suggesting that he wasn’t a huge fan of the EU as it exists today. \nLabour’s Shadow Business Secretary, Angela Eagle MP and former Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling were in the North East to make the economic case for Britain staying in the European Union. \nSpeaking at the Hewlett Packard Enterprise site in North Tyneside, Lord Darling said that “the stakes couldn’t be higher” \nThe big set-piece BBC TV debate, at Wembley arena, saw London mayor Sadiq Khan, a Remain supporter, tell Leave campaigners such as Boris Johnson: “You should know better”. \nBut Mr Johnson delivered a passionate and eloquent speech in favour of leaving the EU at the end of the programme. Wednesday \nA final day of frantic activity saw political leaders from past and present wheeled out to make a last-minute plea to voters. \nDavid Cameron warned Brexit would be “bad for jobs” - but his predecessor as Prime Minister, former Tory leader John Major, was also on the campaign trail. \nJeremy Corbyn said the NHS would be under threat if we left, while former Labour leader Gordon Brown also called for a Remain vote. \nAnd Lib Dem leader Tim Farron was joined by his predecessor Paddy Ashdown to back EU membership. \nA bizarre battle broke out over which side of the debate famous footballers were on. \nThe Leave campaign said former Newcastle United footballer John Barnes backed their campaign - only for him to state that he was backing Remain. Thursday \nPolling day, and campaigners were hard at work trying to ensure their supporters actually went out to vote. \nIt’s the same sort of operation we see in general elections - including lots of knocking on doors - but the remain campaign had an advantage here. \nThey had the official Labour Party machinery to help them, while the Lib Dems and Greens are also backing Remain (the Conservative Party is officially neutral in this campaign). Simon Greener Polling stations across the region for the EU referendum St Andrews Newcastle \nHowever the Leave campaign didn’t have any party machine to help them. \nThe remain campaign was confident, when the polls closed at 10pm. \nAnd as counting began, UKIP leader Nigel Farage admitted that he thought Britain may have voted narrowly to remain in the EU. Friday \nThe first place to finish counting votes and announce a result was Gibraltar, which was involved in the referendum despite not being part of the UK. \nBut Newcastle was the first place in the UK to make an announcement, at about five minutes past midnight. \nAnd immediately, the remain campaign knew something was wrong. \nThey’d won - but with a tiny majority. \nJust 50.7% of Newcastle voters wanted the UK to remain a member of the European Union while 49.3% wanted to leave. \nThe experts had expected it to be better than that for the remain campaign. \nAs time went by it became clear that other parts of the North East had voted overwhelmingly to leave. \nAnd most part of the UK - with the exception of Scotland, Northern Ireland and London - had done the same. \nThe optimism of the remain campaign faded. British Prime Minister David Cameron resigns on the steps of 10 Downing Street \nAnd it slowly became clear to the leave campaign that they had won. \nAt around 4.45 am, the BBC announced that the UK had voted to leave the EU. \nThere were still more votes to be counted, but it wasn’t possible for Remain to win, the BBC’s analysts had concluded. \nA few hours later, David Cameron made his announcement outside Downing Street. \nHe was quitting. \nWe don’t know who will replace him. In fact, we don’t know very much about what the future holds at all. \nBut one way or another, this week began a new chapter in the history of our country. Saturday \nBritain wakes to a new political climate - but where do we go from here?
