Remaining in the EU and extending the Single Market could see the creation of an additional 5,640, the CBI argues. \nA further 5,690 jobs could likewise be added to the North East’s distribution and retail sector, within which 12,370 North East jobs are currently reliant on trade with the Single Market. \nIn administrative and supports, meanwhile, the current figure is around 9,200. \nSarah Glendinning, CBI North East director, said: “The UK’s membership of the European Union has been of enormous benefit to the North East for over 40 years. \n“Some of the key sectors that lie at the heart of communities across the region, from manufacturing to retail, rely on our membership of the Single Market. \n“Virtually every economist agrees that leaving the EU would likely cause an economic shock, damaging the North East’s prospects. \n“We’d not only put a dent in what we have now, we’d also miss out on thousands of jobs in the near future, as a result of losing access to the Single Market, pulling the rug from under our local economy. \n“This is why the majority of businesses want the UK to remain inside the EU, to best drive growth, support and create jobs, and increase prosperity for our region.” The European Union debate", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-06-21T02:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-06-21T05:30:29.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
