Shares Get daily news by email A van displaying an advert opposing Ukip Leader Nigel Farage \nBritain has decided to leave the UK - but what impact will the historic result have on our football teams? \nBoth Newcastle United and Sunderland have squads packed with talent from the continent and beyond. \nThe Magpies’ squad for the 2015/16 Premier League season had 10 players from the EU, while Sunderland’s had 12. \nAnd that is not including United’s Spanish boss, Rafa Benitez . \nSo how does a British exit from the EU affect our football teams? \nWe asked Dr Francesco De Cecco, a lecturer in law at Newcastle University , what could happen. Moussa Sissoko of Newcastle What are the current rules? \nAs it stands, players from countries inside the EU can live and work in the UK without a work permit. \nThis means Newcastle and Sunderland stars such as Moussa Sissoko and Fabio Borini are free to ply their trade in this country without any added paperwork. \nIf we voted remain, that would have stayed the same. \nBut that could all change now. What could happen now we've left? \nAccording to Dr De Cecco, no-one knows for sure and it could be years before the impact of a Brexit is felt. \nHe said: “It is impossible to predict what will happen with any degree of certainty because it depends on the Government’s negotiations. Player quotas are unlikely to come in because UEFA has already abolished them. \n“But what could possibly happen is players form the European Union could have to apply for visas and have conditions imposed on them, just like players from outside the EU.” PA Wire Sunderland's Lamine Kone (left) celebrates scoring his side's third goal of the game with teammates Younes Kaboul and Jermain Defoe So, what conditions are put on players from outside the EU? \nPlayers from outside the EU, for example Newcastle’s Argentinian defender Fabricio Coloccini or Sunderland’s Ivory Coast star Lamine Kone , have no automatic right to live and work in the UK. \nInstead, according to Dr De Cecco, there are strict rules around non-EU workers coming to the UK. \nThe Home Office requires players from the top 10 ranked nations in world football to have played 30% of their games in the two years prior to the date of a work permit application. \nFor players at a nation ranked 11-20 in the world table, they must have been involved of 45% of matches, which rises to 60% for 21-30 ranked teams and finally 75% for countries ranked 31-50. Fabricio Coloccini during a Newcastle United training session Does that mean some foreign players could be deported? \nYes - but they probably won’t be. \nDr De Cecco said: “It’s very unlikely to happen but theoretically it could. If we are being realistic, football is a huge business and that will no doubt put pressure on the Government. \n“We would have a period of uncertainty but it’s unlikely draconian rules would be introduced that stop European footballers coming here. \n“It might have an impact on the smaller and poorer clubs and that is something that needs to be taken into account.” What about the Bosman ruling? \nDr De Cecco says the Bosman Rule, which allows a player to leave his club for free when his contract finishes, would be unchanged by a Brexit because it falls under FIFA’s jurisdiction rather than UEFA’s. So, what does Dr De Cecco think will happen? \nDespite the possibility of players being deported as a result of Brexit, Dr De Cecco does not believe such a drastic outcome is likely. \nHe said: “Football clubs are powerful commercial entities. It would be in the interests of all parties concerned to make it as easy as possible for club to have the best talents - no matter where they come from.” More on the EU Referendum", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-06-24T07:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-06-24T07:44:51.994+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
