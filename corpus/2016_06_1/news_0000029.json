all within the time it has taken the Magpies to add to their trophy haul. \nThere have been a couple of Texaco Cups, an Anglo-Italian Cup, two second-tier titles, and even the UEFA Intertoto Cup - but no major trophy since 1969. \nOn June 11, 1969, Bob Moncur - now a member of the Newcastle board - held aloft the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in the Megyeri uti Stadium in Budapest following the Magpies’ 6-2 aggregate victory over Ujpesti Dozsa. \nNewcastle supporters’ wait for further now glory stands at 47 years and counting. 09:49 Daniel Milligan Pervert sexually assaulted two sleeping girls \nA pervert who groped two young girls as they slept and molested a teenager after plying her with drink has been jailed. \nMichael Todd admitted sexually assaulting two youngsters when they were as young as seven while they were asleep. \nAnd while on bail for those offences, he groped a 14-year-old girl after plying her with vodka and lager. \nNow the 37-year-old has been jailed for three years at Newcastle Crown Court after he admitted six offences of sexual assault. 09:40 Daniel Milligan International news \nAn attacker has stormed a gay nightclub in Florida and is reported to have taken hostages. \nThe shooting happened at the Pulse Club in Orlando causing people to flee in terror. \nEyewitnesses say the attacker stormed the club before shooting about 20 people. \nThe gunman is feared to have shot towards the crowd, with about 100 people inside. 09:31 Daniel Milligan Jarrow parade \nMayor’s Sunday Parade in Jarrow today. \nParade leaves Hedworthfield Primary School using Linkway, Fellgate Av, Durham Dr and St Joseph’s Way to St Joseph’s Catholic Church. \nIt then makes the return journey an hour later. Expect rolling road closures 09:30-10:15 and 11:15-12:00 in the Fellgate area until 12:00 09:23 Daniel Milligan \nOne to watch out for on the Central Motorway. 09:15 Daniel Milligan Controversial plans to build 285 homes \nCampaigners are celebrating after controversial plans to build hundreds of homes and almost double the size of a Northumberland village were refused for a second time. \nBarratt Developments applied to build 285 homes in New Hartley, near Seaton Delaval , claiming it would create 440 jobs and generate £55m for the economy. \nThe development would have increased the size of the village by 45% and more than 800 people objected against the proposals. \nIn April, Northumberland County Council’s strategic planning committee rejected the application over concerns about the size of development and lack of affordable housing. \nHowever, councillors were asked to review their five reasons for refusal after the authority was warned it could face “substantial costs” if an appeal was lodged. \nAt a meeting on Tuesday, the committee reduced their reasons to one, which represented their best chance of it being defended at an appeal. 09:09 Daniel Milligan Sunday's weather forecast \nAnother cloudy day, with light onshore winds continuing to bring low cloud and a little rain to the area, particularly early in the day, with some limited brighter spells later in the day. \nFog occasionally affecting the Cheviots and Pennines. Maximum Temperature 16 °C. \nTonight: A cloudy night is in prospect with some patchy light rain or drizzle in places and hill fog. Winds remaining light. Minimum Temperature 12 °C. 09:00 Daniel Milligan Good morning \nWelcome to The Chronicle’s live breaking news blog for Sunday, June 12, 2016. \nHere, are our regular updates throughout the day of all the breaking news and sport from across the North East. \nWe have pictures, video, tweets and comments covering the latest Newcastle and North East traffic, weather forecasts, crime and council news too. \nIt’s Daniel Milligan at the helm for the afternoon and into the evening.
