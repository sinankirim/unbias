He is sincere and authentic and many also think he’s the most honest politician.” \nHowever she acknowledged that there were shortcomings in Labour’s campaign. \n“We need to learn a lesson in terms of reflecting and engaging and speaking to working class people which I don’t think our campaign did,” she said. \n“It is telling that Bullingdon Boy Boris Johnson managed to be more convincing to many Labour voters that the Labour party. We’ve got to recognise that and we’ve got to respond.” \nShe added: “A lot of people if immigrant heritage including myself are not feeling welcome in Britain today. We’ve got to make that we address that, that we reassure them in the North East and Newcastle.” \nBoth Mr Mearns and Ms Onwurah expressed concern that with the UK heading out of the EU, European grants and funding which had underpinned much development in the North East was going to be lost. \n“We will be relying on funding from London and Boris Johnson which isn’t very reassuring,” said Ms Onwurah. \nDespite his support in this region, it could be a rocky few days ahead for Mr Corbyn. \nAlthough the no confidence motion has no formal status, backers hope it will help build a sense that confidence in the leader is draining away, forcing him to resign before a likely autumn general election. \nDame Margaret emphasised that under PLP rules it would be a secret ballot for her no confidence motion, in the hope that MPs would be emboldened to move against Mr Corbyn without the fear of a backlash from his grassroots supporters in the Momentum campaign group. \nMr Corbyn insisted he would run again if forced into a crisis leadership election which would be decided by grassroots members. \nAsked if he would stand in such circumstances, he said: “Yes, I’m here, thank you.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-06-25T19:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-06-25T20:25:18.265+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
