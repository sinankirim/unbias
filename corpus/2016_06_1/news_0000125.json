But it only became an actual road race in 1981 and was the brainchild of Dr James Dewar, of Blaydon Harriers, who organised the first 24 races.

She died later in hospital despite a rescue attempt by Cullercoats’ RNLI crew. \nHer mum, Sabrina Cook, is backing the RNLI’s Respect the Water campaign, as the lifeboat charity revealed 22 people lost their lives by the coast in the North East last year. \nAlmost half of the 122 those killed in coastal fatalities between 2011 and 2014 were not planning on getting in the water. Many, like Caitlin, were simply walking or running near the sea and were dragged in by freak waves. 07:30 Daniel Milligan Wallsend house fire \nThe bedroom of a house in Wallsend was gutted as a fire ripped through the property. \nFirefighters from Gosforth were called to the two-storey house in Merlin Crescent in Wallsend at 1.13am. \nA spokesman for Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service said the people living in the house managed to get out of the property before they arrived. \nThey said the first-floor bedroom was destroyed by fire and the rest of the first floor was damaged by smoke. \nFirefighters used two hose reels and positive pressure ventilation equipment to clear the smoke from the house. \nNo-one was hurt. 07:25 Daniel Milligan Rush-hour round-up \nSlow traffic on A194(M) Northbound between A182 Washington Highway / B1288 (Havannah Interchange) and A194 Leam Lane / A184 / A184 Newcastle Road (White Mare Pool Roundabout). \nSlow traffic on A167(M) Southbound between A167 and A186 City Road / A186 Mosley Street / Pilgrim Street (Swanhouse Roundabout). \nSlow traffic on A695 Eastbound between Stargate Lane (Stargate Roundabout) and A69. 07:21 Daniel Milligan On the roads \nVery slow traffic on A19 Northbound between A184 Newcastle Road ( Testo’s Roundabout) and A185 (Tyne Tunnel). \nAlso, very slow traffic on A184 Newcastle Road Westbound between A194 Leam Lane / A194(M) / A184 White Mare Pool Roundabout and A185 Shields Road / B1426 Shields Road ( Heworth Roundabout). 07:16 Daniel Milligan Hundreds putting their sight at risk \nEye specialists in Newcastle fear hundreds of people in the North East are at risk of going blind because of a lack of awareness about glaucoma. \nThe condition can be present for many years without a person being aware of it, as there are no symptoms in the early stages. \nIf left untreated, glaucoma can lead to serious loss of vision, with up to 40% of sight being permanently lost before the effects are noticed. \nWhile the damage caused by glaucoma is permanent, early diagnosis and treatment can prevent vision-threatening loss. The key to treating glaucoma successfully is diagnosing it early. 07:10 Daniel Milligan Gordon Brown at the Sage Gateshead \nFormer Prime Minister leader Gordon Brown took centre stage again this time in a European Union referendum event at a packed Sage Gateshead tonight. \nHe told an audience of Labour supporters how the EU had helped the North East recover from the “devastation” he said was inflicted by Tory Governments in the 1970s and 80s, and that the union would continue to “defend” the region into the future. \nOpening on a whimsical note with an anecdote about Albert Einstein, who he said had once travelled around Britain speaking about Europe giving the same speech everywhere he went, Mr Brown said he would be taking a different tactic, focusing on the issues the question of Brexit raised in the North East specifically. 07:05 Daniel Milligan Blaydon Race day \nWith the Blaydon Race just a day away, what better way to celebrate than to listen to the ‘anthem of Tyneside’ - The Blaydon Races. \nWritten in 1862 by Geordie Ridley the original Blaydon Races song tells the story of a mad-cap journey to this highlight of the Tyneside calendar on June 9. \nOver the centuries the Blaydon Races became a Geordie anthem with a well-deserved place in the life of the region, but do you know all the words? \nAhead of this year’s event, we asked local musician Simma, aka as Anthony Simpson, to perform the Blaydon Races at The Vermont Hotel’s Sky Lounge with the back drop of the Tyne Bridge and Sage Gateshead. \nWe’ve even added the words - in traditional Geordie style of course - on the screen to help you sing along. \nSimma, from Benwell, has been building a loyal following across the North East since 1997 as a solo acoustic artist and singer-songwriter. \nThe accomplished musician is well-known across the region for his music and for running Acoustic Circus, which hosts regular busker and open mic nights.

The man then approached the officers with a large carving knife, and two officers opened fire. He was wounded several times, and three women were also hurt. \nThe women, who are between 60 and 80-years-old, and the man were being treated at various hospitals and were all in stable condition. 06:55 Daniel Milligan \nOne to watch out for on the Metros this morning. 06:49 Daniel Milligan Other fire service callouts \nCrews were called out to a number of incidents overnight, including: Fire crews from West Denton responded to report of a fire in a commercial building in Cowgate area of Newcastle.
