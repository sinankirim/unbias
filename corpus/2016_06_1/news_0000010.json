Some major international buyers of debt are only allowed to hold AAA-rated bonds, meaning they would not be able to buy Government debt if it was downgraded to the next level down, AA+. 11:19 Tom Eden What is the UK’s current financial situation? \nThe UK Government has one of the largest budget deficits of any advanced economy, with public sector net debt excluding banks reaching £1,606.9 billion, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). That debt is equivalent to 83.7% of the UK’s economic output, known as gross domestic product (GDP).The ONS said the Chancellor borrowed £74.9 billion for the financial year ending in March, overshooting the annual target by £2.7 billion.It was a setback for George Osborne in his efforts to shore up the nation’s finances after he pledged to return the UK to a surplus by 2020.The ratings agencies are concerned Brexit will make this plan harder to achieve, particularly as they predict economic growth will be stunted and uncertainty over trade arrangements will be prolonged while Britain negotiates to leave the EU. 11:19 Tom Eden UK's credit rating downgraded \nThe financial shockwaves of the Brexit vote have begun to reverberate as the outlook on Britain’s credit rating was downgraded to “negative”.Ratings agency Moody’s changed the UK’s long-term issuer and debt ratings to negative from stable due to uncertainty after the vote to leave the European Union.Another leading agency, Standard and Poor’s (S&P), also warned that Britain could lose its AAA rating following the referendum result.Moody’s and another ratings agency, Fitch, had already stripped Britain of its AAA rating before the referendum. But what does it mean for the UK? \nI’ll be posting some Q&As now. 11:11 Tom Eden \nMore than one million people have now signed an online petition calling for a new EU referendum. 11:00 Two women stuck in waist high mud at Blyth \nA dramatic rescue operation was launched after two women became trapped in deep mud. Rescue operation at Blyth Harbour after two women became stuck in waist deep mud \nIt took around an hour to free the stricken pair after they became stuck in an area of waist high mud, at Blyth Harbour, today. \nBoth were taken to hospital following the rescue, which involved firefighters, paramedics and lifeboat crews. \nIt is thought one of the women suffered a cardiac arrest at the scene. She remains in a serious condition in hospital. \nThe rescue was launched after a member of the public spotted two people ‘floating’ near Battleship Wharf. 10:53 Tom Eden Alnwick hit by flash floods yesterday \nFlash floods hit Alnwick after a burst of heavy rain and lightning yesterday.

The showers will slowly die out through the evening. 10:38 Tom Eden Petition for second EU referendum \nA parliamentary petition for a second referendum has attracted almost a million signatures despite unprecedented demand crashing the website. Petition for the UK to have a second EU referendum 10:31 Tom Eden How Newcastle are trying to improve their injury record \nNewcastle United will announce measures to tackle their long-standing injury problems next week – with the club set to appoint additional medical staff as part of Rafa Benitez’s backroom revamp. Newcastle United's Daryl Janmaat in pain after Southampton score their second goal \nNewcastle are nearing their first new signing and hope to have new players in place by the first week of July, when most of the squad will be back from their summer break. But there is also work going on behind the scenes to improve scouting, injuries and the Academy. \nTo that end, Benitez and United will announce additional medical staff to enhance the medical care given to players in a bid to get to the bottom of problems which the United manager is acutely aware of. \nThe Spanish boss has been studying the injury data for the last few seasons and is fully aware that it does not make pretty reading for him or the club. Premierleagueinjuries.comestimated that United lost a collective 2,288 days to injury last season - the highest in the top flight. 10:26 Tom Eden Could the EU referendum results be overturned? \nIs all lost for those who cling to the dream that the UK remain part of the European Union ? \nIt’s been pretty gloomy over the past 24 hours since the result came in. \nTWO TRILLION dollars have been wiped off the markets since the UK voted to leave the EU. That’s $2,000,000,000,000 (yes, twelve zeros...) \nOn top of that, Leave campaigners have rowed back on lots of promises made in the referendum, including the £350m extra each week for the NHS, immediately triggering the process of withrawing from Europe and astonishingly their claims about stopping immigration: \nSo for those looking for straws to clutch at, how about the following. \nThe vote to Leave is not actually legally binding as it is parliament and not the voters who make that decision. \nLegal experts have pointed out the Brexit vote is “advisory,” not “mandatory”. \nAs such MPs can legally disregard the public’s will and decide the path Britain chooses.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-06-25T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-06-25T14:44:03.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
