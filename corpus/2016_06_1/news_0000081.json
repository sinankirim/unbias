That is as true in the North as it is anywhere else. Most business group polls conclude that a majority of small, medium and large companies want to remain in the EU. \n“The economic consensus is clear too – we should expect a Brexit to induce a sharp shock that could leave the UK economy smaller in future.” \nThe CBI supported the Government’s efforts to secure economic growth outside of London, the letter said. \nThe organisation also agreed with the goals of the Northern Powerhouse, as “better transport and education will create greater opportunities for companies based here and more jobs”. \n“Investment from abroad is critical to this,” the letter continued. “Recent analysis shows northern-based foreign direct investment projects experienced 127% growth over the last two years. \n“Many foreign investors cite access to EU markets as a critical factor in their UK investment decisions. \n“So, we must recognise that reduced market access could slow regional investment.” \nThe letter said there were “clear signs” the North had been making progress in recent years. \n“Putting that trend of rising investment at risk would put growth and jobs in our region in jeopardy, undermining the North’s potential to become a true powerhouse,” it concluded. \nIn an interview with The Journal, Ms Glendinning pointed that the idea of Brexit potentially compromising future growth had been reinforced by a recent survey by accountancy group EY. \nAnd, while the North East had a strong record when it came to exporting to places such as China and India, the European Single Market represented a £5bn-a-year opportunity, particularly through trade with countries such as Italy, Belgium, Spain and the Netherlands. \nBusinesses of all sizes - not just large firms like Hitachi and Virgin Money - could benefit from this, and, particularly in sectors like automotive, the impact on the supply chain was considerable, she said. \n“This is one of the biggest decisions many of us will get to make in our lifetimes,” she said. “So it is absolutely incumbent upon employers to be talking about the impact of the referendum result. \n“They should also make sure they provide opportunities for employees to vote, whether that is through shift changes or just through providing a bit more flexibility.” \nIt was crucial, she added, that voters were in possession of the facts. \n“There are lots of reasons upon which people will base their decisions, but the overwhelming view from economic experts - who don’t always agree with each other - that for jobs, prosperity and growth, we should be remaining in the UK,” she said.
