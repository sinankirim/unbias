An outsider's view on the EU referendum 18:29, 16 Jun 2016 French reporter Cecile Reto visited Newcastle and the North East to find out what the region thought about the EU Shares Get daily news by email Cecile Reto \nWhat does the rest of Europe think about the Brexit debate? To find out, we spoke to a French journalist who visited the North East to cover the EU referendum for her newspaper. MIKE KELLY reports. \nFor many, particularly in the UK regions, the feeling is the Brexit debate has become a London-centric face off between Tory party factions. \nIt’s David Cameron and George Osborne versus Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, with UKIP’s Nigel Farage the between rounds entertainment. \nThat’s not to decry the efforts of the campaign groups working day and night to educate a public on a steep learning curve about what the EU means to them. \nHowever the British media seems, by and large, to have locked into the ‘Tory party bun fight’ narrative. \nSo it was a pleasant surprise that journalist Cecile Reto, of the French newspaper Ouest France, chose to ignore London and came to Newcastle and the North East to get a perspective on what the EU referendum means to the public. \n“The reason I came to Newcastle was because of Nissan, which I saw as a big EU company in a region which has been touched by so much austerity,” said Cecile. “I wanted to give our readers a different view other than that of London.” \nWe are talking, via an interpreter, at the Bridge Hotel in the shadow of the castle from which Newcastle got its name. \nShe was a few days into a one week stay and said it had proved both a rewarding and enlightening experience. \nShe said: “I’ve been surprised by the answers I have got. A lot of people say their views about leaving or remaining in the EU are not about their politics but personal opinions.” \nThe French EU article \nWhat Cecile is saying is that while the North East is a Labour party stronghold, voters up here might not be sticking to the party line when it comes to the EU vote. \nThis could be bad news for the Remain group, if the perception of political party allegiance is anything to go by. \nWhile the impression given, despite the best efforts of David Cameron , is the Tory party is inherently anti Europe, Labour is seen as pro the EU. But not all the party’s supporters up here agree. \nWhat Cecile discovered is something that has become clear in the campaign. Labour supporters are divided on whether to stay in or leave the EU, the urban areas of Newcastle and Sunderland being pro Remain and the rural areas as well as South Tyneside for Leave. \nFor weeks now since the campaigning began in earnest it has not just seemed to be the main topic of debate in the UK. Hardly a days go by without some politician from abroad having their say. \nSo, the whole world knows what’s happening here and has an opinion? Perhaps, not. \nCecile said: “Some French people don’t even know the referendum is happening. \n“Those who do know are quite divided. They think if the UK does leave it will be the beginning of the end and other countries will leave too. Others think ‘it’s those Brits again, they’ve never liked the EU’.” \nFrom a personal point of view, Cecile said she is worried at the thought of the UK leaving, especially with the growing migrant and financial crises in Europe. \n“If the UK leaves it could show Europe doesn’t have a place and it would give the narrative to UKIP and the (extreme right) Front National in France.” \nThe French EU article \nShe added: “I’m scared not just for economic reasons but for those European values upon which the EU is based that are at risk - peace and friendship between neighbouring countries, and security.” \nAnd Cecile added that for those in France who have been paying attention to what’s happening in the UK, it has caused them to think more deeply about their position within it. \n“They have started asking questions about a referendum in France. But I think as it stands about 37% would vote to leave and 60% would vote to stay but I think that 37% are trying to stoke the fires a bit. \n“Even then, if it came to it, I think they’d vote to stay. The danger isn’t real in France.” \nShe added: “We can’t actually imagine a Brexit happening. A lot of French people are convinced that at the last minute people are going to turn out and be reasonable and vote to stay.” \nCecile laughed at the “be reasonable and vote stay” line, branding it “French arrogance.” AP Photo/Remy de la Mauviniere Far right party National Front leader Marine Le Pen \nInterestingly as the momentum seems to be with Leave at present there is another story brewing across the channel about the repercussions of a Brexit. \n“I’ve got colleagues working in Normandy who say there’s been an increase in people wanting to become naturalised French citizens since the start of the year,” she said. \nAnd Cecile assumes this could be being repeated across a country where around 200,000 Brits have homes. So popular is it with ex-pats that Dordogne in the south west of France has been nicknamed Dordogneshire. \nCecile said: “I’ve worked in a few different offices and remember in Mayenne in the Loire department I went into a village that had more English schoolchildren than it did French children. It was a very small school, but it was funny all the same. \n“And I’ve noticed that a number of English people have now been elected as councillors in French councils.” \nSo it seems after 1066 when French king William conquered England, if there’s a Brexit in 2016 there might be a British invasion of sorts in the opposite direction.
