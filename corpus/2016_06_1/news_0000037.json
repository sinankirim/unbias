He chose not to.” It's right that David Cameron has gone. Not a bad man just on the wrong side of the argument. — Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) June 24, 2016 \nHe suggested that Boris Johnson, Michael Gove or Liam Fox would be potential leadership contenders. \nHe accused Mr Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne of behaving in an “appalling” way during the campaign. \nHe said: “The Conservative party has literally split down the middle over this and I know a lot of Conservative MPs I’ve spoken to who feel that frankly the way he [David Cameron] and [George] Osborne have behaved in this campaign has been appalling. \n“They have stretched the truth, let’s be nice, I could use a stronger word.” \nHe said Conservative backbenchers would not want “this man to stay on”. \nMr Farage also said that he hoped the win would bring down the entire “failed project” that is the EU and revealed his desire for June 23 to be declared a Bank Holiday, saying that it will “go down in our history as our independence day”.
