The power is in your hands. \nToday’s vote on whether we stay in the European Union will determine the future of the United Kingdom for generations to come. \nRight now, the future for the North East is bright. And the stakes are too high for a gamble which could change all that. \nBecause that’s exactly what a vote for Brexit is – a throw of the dice using North East jobs and our children’s future as gambling chips. \nOur busy ports are Britain’s gateway to the world. That’s why the North East is the only region with a positive balance of trade - meaning we export more than we import. \nForeign firms such as Nissan have so much confidence in the North East that they’ve invested literally billions of pounds here, while the region is at the heart of the UK’s energy sector. Owen Humphreys/PA Wire Workers at Nissan's plant in Sunderland on the production line \nThe North East is home to 6,000 digital businesses. And with firms like Virgin Money in Newcastle, it also has a growing financial services industry. \nAnd we’re home to some of the best universities in the world. \nWe know there is poverty and other problems too. \nBut the North East is proud and successful - and we can only tackle the challenges we face if we have a strong economy behind us. \nWhy risk it all with an unnecessary leap into the dark by leaving the European Union? \nThe EU hasn’t held us back. It’s helped us. \nAcross the region there are developments which create jobs and were built with EU money. \nPortobello Trade Park in Durham is one example. The Core Science Central in Newcastle city centre is another - and there are many more. \nThe Core at Newcastle Science Central \nIt’s true that the UK contributes to the EU. Yes, we put money in and then get it back. \nBut the alternative is that spending decisions would be made by central government instead. And there’s no reason to imagine it would be more generous to the North East. \nIn fact, it could be said that Brussels has been a better friend than London to Northumberland and County Durham, Tyne and Wear and the Tees Valley. \nThe North East looks beyond Europe. \nManagers at Newcastle Airport , a vital part of the economy with big plans for the future, will tell you that. \nBut being part of Europe helps us win trade and investment from across the globe. \nJapanese firm Hitachi couldn’t have put it more plainly in its statement on the referendum, when it said: “Hitachi, like other multinationals, invested in the UK in order to access the whole of the EU market, and unimpeded access to the EU market is fundamental for our position in the UK.” AP Photo/Geert Vanden Wijngaert British Prime Minister David Cameron speaks \nIt’s EU membership that gives us access to the EU market - all those people in France, Germany, Italy and Spain who want to buy things made here in the North East. \nWhat do anti-EU campaigners offer instead? A vague promise that if we quit then we’ll be able to negotiate a new deal giving us access to European markets again. \nBut they can’t guarantee that. And they certainly can’t tell us how long it will take, because they just don’t know. \nThis isn’t a game. This is a real threat to the prosperity and success of our industries, our institutions and our communities here in the North East. \nThat’s why everyone from the heads of our universities to employers big and small, the region’s top scientists, premier league football clubs and the Bishop of Durham is urging Britain to vote to remain in the EU. \nThe Union Jack flag flies besides the flag of the European Union \nSet against a positive vision of a successful North East in the European Union is the “leave” campaign’s vision of our country - frightened and turning its back on the world. \nThey say that millions of Turks are set to invade Britain if we stay in the EU. But this is just fearmongering. Turkey is not joining the EU for the foreseeable future, because of its poor human rights record. \nWe can’t cut ourselves off from our neighbours. And we can’t put our jobs and exports at risk, as the leave campaign wants us to do. \nThe North East is strong and successful when it looks out across the world, trading, attracting investment and collaborating. \nWe do that best as part of the European Union. \nAnd that’s why the best way to safeguard the future of this region, our families and generations to come is to vote “remain” today.
