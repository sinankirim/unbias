People realised that the essence of this argument was the democratic one - whether we are going to be a self-governing democratic country again or whether we are going to be governed by unelected officials in Europe.” Jonathan Arnott MEP \nNorth East UKIP MEP Jonathan Arnott said: “This is a tremendous day for Britain and for our democratic process. \n“The people of the North East have led the way in voting clearly for Brexit. The British people as a whole have spoken and we have regained control over our own destiny. \n“Now the hard work begins: we must now deal with our European colleagues as friends and neighbours and negotiate a deal for the future which allows us to trade freely with the EU, control our borders and work together for our mutual benefit.” \nThe mood on the side of Remain was fatigued as the realisation hit - the region and indeed the nation had turned its back on the EU. North-East Labour MEP Jude Kirton-Darling \nJude Kirton-Darling, Labour MEP for the North East, said: “It is with great disappointment and sadness that I have learned that the United Kingdom has voted to leave the European Union. \n“There’s been lots of anger on the doorstep about the future direction of this country and people are rightly concerned about housing, precarious work and the state of our public services. People must be listened to and I hope the Government listens now.” \nPaul Brannen, another North East Labour MEP, added: “This is not the result the Labour Party and the main trade unions were hoping for. \n“We strongly believed that our place is within the Europe Union, working together with our neighbours for peace and prosperity. \n“I hope that those who negotiate our exit from the EU don’t forget the people of the North East but frankly I can’t see a bunch of Tories in London doing that. \n“However I will continue to work hard for the region as we now face a difficult and uncertain future but we are a resilient region and together we will pull through.” More on the EU Referendum", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-06-24T08:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-06-24T09:20:42.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
