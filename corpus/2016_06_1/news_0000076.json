Meanwhile more than half - or 56% - of 25 to 49-year-olds also backed the pro-EU option, according to initial estimates of the vote breakdown by YouGov. \nIt is they who may have to live with the consequences the longest who seemed most disappointed with the result. \nMeanwhile it was older voters who were most keen on Brexit. \nNewcastle Central MP Chi Onwurah expressed her sympathy with the petition signers and felt what the EU did for the UK didn’t get a fair hearing. \nShe said: “For the last 40 years politicians of all parties have been blaming the EU for everything from the shape of cucumbers to the demise of the coal and steel industry. \n“We had a three month campaign to turn around 40 years of negativity and it proved an uphill task.” More on the EU Referendum", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-06-25T20:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-06-25T20:25:16.621+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
