We can see no case for taking such a gamble with our security that leaving the EU would entail.” \nHome Office Minister James Brokenshire insisted Britain must work “even more closely” with other EU countries in the fight against terror. DAILY RECORD Airport security \n“The firm view from those with significant frontline experience of fighting organised crime and terrorism is that we gain clear security benefits by remaining in the EU,” he said. \n“Britain gets the best of both worlds by harnessing our access to EU security systems in combination with our enduring intelligence relationships with partners like the US. \n“At a time of continuing terrorist threat our domestic security requires us to work even more closely with our European partners. \n“It’s difficult to see how we can possibly do this by shouting from the sidelines rather than sitting at the table as an equal member.” \nAlso read: Everything you need to know about registering to vote in the EU referendum \nLabour’s former Home Secretary, Charles Clarke, said: “Michael Gove might not want to hear from experts but I trust the opinion of those who have spent their careers fighting crime and terrorism. \n“These distinguished police chiefs who know a thing or two about our security could not be clearer - we are safer in the EU than we would be out on our own.” \nThe group includes ex-Scotland Yard chiefs Lord Blair and Lord Condon, Sir Matt Baggott, former chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, Sir Peter Fahy, former chief constable of Greater Manchester Police, ex-Acpo president Sir Hugh Orde, Sir Paul Scott-Lee, former chief constable of Suffolk Constabulary and Peter Neyroud, former chief constable of Thames Valley Police.
