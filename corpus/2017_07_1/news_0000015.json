It came as easyJet announced the number of people flying with the carrier jumped 11.3% to 7.7m in June. \nFocusing on the load factor - a measure which judges how efficiently airlines are filling seats - the budget airline was marginally higher at 94.8%. \nMr Crozier was credited with turning ITV’s fortunes around during his seven-year stint at the broadcaster. Under his tenure, ITV’s external revenues grew by more than £1bn and earnings jumped by 338%. \nHowever, the group endured its first drop in full-year advertising revenues since 2009 when it announced annual results in March, but underlying pre-tax profits held largely firm at £847m in 2016 against £843m in 2015. \nSpeculation has been mounting that ITV could become the subject of a takeover attempt from a rival broadcaster, with sterling’s Brexit-induced slump making the firm more attractive to overseas buyers.

Like-for-like sales of lifestyle goods were up by 1.2%, helped by strong tourist numbers and Father’s Day, and homeware sales were up 0.5%. \nNon-store sales dipped during the hot weather before rallying at the end of the month to like-for-like growth of 22.2% for the month overall. \nSophie Michael, head of retail and wholesale at BDO LLP, warned that June’s growth should be considered in the context of last year’s “dismal” post-EU referendum figures. \nShe said: \nThis time last year the EU referendum outcome led to reluctance by consumers to spend, making it the high street’s worst June in a decade. \nThis June, consumers were distracted by a general election, but that didn’t stop them heading to the shops when the sun came out. \nRetailers will take heart from consumers’ willingness to spend, but there is evidence shoppers are delving into their savings which is clearly not a sustainable position. \nWith real earnings falling which will inevitably result in consumers to tighten their belts, product range and the retail experience will be ever more important factors together with discount offers to encourage spending.

Under his tenure, Howdens has grown from a company with a £1m turnover to reporting annual sales of more than £1.3bn in 2016. \nHowdens boasts more than 450,000 account holders and operates from 650 depots across the UK, and sees scope for up to 800. \nMr Ingle said: “Howdens is well set for the future, and I believe that now is the right time for me to step down and pass the baton on to Andrew. \n“I believe the company has the resources to look forward and to develop a new chapter in its development, and there are exciting choices for the new generation of leaders to make.” \nMr Livingston has headed up Screwfix since 2013 - where he has overseen booming sales - and has also done stints at Wyevale Garden Centres and B&Q. 9:02 Jonathon Manning Shield Therapeutics strikes significant deal to sell pioneering iron deficiency drug in Switzerland \nShield Therapeutics has moved one step closer to achieving its £500m a year turnover target after striking a deal to sell its leading drug in Switzerland . \nThe Gateshead-headquartered pharmaceutical firm manufactures Feraccru, an iron deficiency drug. \nFeraccru has predominantly been sold in the UK but Shield has been taking the sales overseas with the hope of growing revenues to £500m per year. \nAs well as the UK the drug has also been sold in Germany, but now Shield has stepped up its European expansion after striking a deal with marketing company Ewopharma EG to sell Feraccru in Switzerland. \nCarl Sterritt, chief executive officer and founder of Shield Therapeutics, said: \nThe agreement entered into today further validates our commitment to roll-out of Feraccru to patients in multiple geographies as quickly as possible. \nIt also reflects the group’s strategy to maximise value for stakeholders through an appropriate mix of self-commercialisation in core markets and licensing in other geographies. \nWe are very pleased to partner with Ewopharma who are ideally placed to commercialise Feraccru in Switzerland and look forward to a successful collaboration in this highly-developed market for IDA. \nSwitzerland is a well-developed market for iron deficiency drugs, and makes up almost 15% of European IV iron sales.

The company said pre-tax profits in the year to March 31 rose 21% to £7.5m, while revenue was up 8% to £168.1m. \nThe firm last year launched the first collection under recently hired creative director Johnny Coca, with nine new bags - including a revamp of its best-selling Bayswater design. The “Zipped Bayswater” bag has become an immediate bestseller since its launch in October.
