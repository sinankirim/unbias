Could   \nThe NHS plan to hire 2,000 overseas doctors is vital to help the North East cope with its “serious GP crisis”, a health official has said. \nDr George Rae said the region urgently needs a “sticking plaster” as a struggle to recruit GPs has left many practices struggling to cope with demand from patients - and even to stay open. \nNHS England announced this week it is to launch a global search for 2,000 more doctors in a bid to solve Britain’s GP crisis. \nThe service’s chief Simon Stevens said four times the 500 extra doctors that had been planned were needed from countries such as New Zealand, Australia and the rest of the EU . \nWhitley Bay GP Dr Rae welcomed the news but said it was not a long-term solution.
