A spokesman for CCHQ said: \"We are aware of these reports, this kind of language is completely unacceptable, and we are urgently investigating.\" \nTheresa May said: \"I was shocked to hear of these remarks, which are completely unacceptable I immediately asked the Chief Whip to suspend the party whip. \n\"Language like this has absolutely no place in politics or in today's society.\" \nBut Devon Live readers, in a poll on our website, have said that she should resign as a result of her comments. \nAs of 10.30am on Tuesday, more than 4,000 people had voted in the poll, and 82 per cent said that she should resign.

She has a history of associating herself with people who hold dubious views and now she has shown that not only does she hold those views, she is not afraid to speak about them. \n\"You simply cannot have people who hold these views representing residents in parliament. \n\"It is worrying for the constituents that she is the MP who represents them and she has shown with these comments that she is simply not up to the job and she needs to resign. \nRichard Younger-Ross, who was the former MP for Teignbridge but lost his seat to her in 2010, said: “Ms Morris is MP who does little except offend, is one of the worst MPs for replying to correspondence, an MP who seems to be rarely in her constituency, and an MP who seems to do little. \n“If she was engaged with people, real people, she would not have said such an odious comment that offends people. \n“She is simply out of touch. She will not resign as an MP, but she should make it clear that she will not re-stand.\" \nMs Morris made the astonishing remark while discussing what financial services deal the UK could struck with Brussels after 2019. \nDespite using the racist term, none of her fellow panelists, including Tory MPs Bill Cash and John Redwood, reacted to the comment. \nAfter saying just seven per cent of financial services in the UK would be affected by Brexit, Morris, who campaigned to leave the EU, said: \"Now I'm sure there will be many people who'll challenge that, but my response and my request is look at the detail, it isn't all doom and gloom. \n\"Now we get to the real n****r in the woodpile which is in two years what happens if there is no deal?\" \nIt comes just after she was forced to distance herself from comments made by her electoral agent and partner at a hustings who claimed 'that the crisis in education was due entirely to non-British born immigrants and their high birth rates'. \nDuring the debate around education and fair funding of schools, a member of the public stood up and said: 'that the crisis in education was due entirely to non-British born immigrants and their high birth rates'. \nThe person who made that remark was Roger Kendrick, who is both Anne Marie Morris's partner and her electoral agent. \nIn response, Anne Marie Morris told DevonLive: \"I don't share the views expressed by Roger Kendrick.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-07-11T17:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-07-11T16:29:51.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
