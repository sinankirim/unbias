X \nCopy link to paste in your message / Comments (0) \nNewton Abbot's MP Anne Marie Morris has been likened to former British National Party (BNP) leader Nick Griffin in the House of Commons. \nThe Tory MP, who used the racially offensive phrase \"n****r in the woodpile\" at a meeting about Brexit with eurosceptics in Central London, was mocked at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday. \nMs Morris, an MP since 2010, made the astonishing remark while discussing what financial services deal the UK could strike with Brussels after 2019. \nLabour's shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry, standing in for leader Jeremy Corbyn at the weekly event, singled out the Devon MP at the Despatch Box. \nIntroducing a question about Brexit in the Commons, she said Ms Morris had \"suddenly turned herself into Nick Griffin\", the former MEP and controversial leader of the far-right party. \nMs Thornberry billed her inquiry as the \"East India\" question, a reference to the exclusive East India Club in St James where Ms Morris made her ill-considered remark. \n\"Can I turn to what I might call the East India question because before the member for Newton Abbot suddenly turned into Nick Griffin, that was the question she was trying to ask,\" she added. \n\"What does no deal actually mean for our business people and for issues such as the Irish land border?\" \nMr Green avoided the subject of Ms Morris's comment and instead focused on the EU, adding: \"Negotiations are going well and her fear of no deal is probably overstated.\" \nGriffin was booted out as leader of the BNP in 2014 after the party lost all its Euro MPs and all but two of its councillors in the local and European elections. \nMr Griffin, who was one of those to lose their seat in Brussels, was declared also bankrupt. \nNewton Abbot residents have their say \nThornberry went on to press Minister for the Cabinet Office Damien Green, standing in for PM Theresa May, who was accompanying the Queen in receiving the Spanish royal family, on whether the Government was still planning to leave the EU without a trade deal. \nRead next: Anne Marie Morris' surgery event on Thursday WILL still go ahead despite N-word row \nThe comments came after Tory leader Theresa May branded the comments unacceptable, suspending the whip, which means that although she is still an MP, she is no longer a Conservative MP. \nNewton Abbot Conservatives say they have no intention of calling for Ms Morris to resign as an MP. \nShe has since apologised for the remarks, saying: \"The comment was unintentional and I apologise unreservedly for any offence caused.\" \nSylvia Russell, president of the Newton Abbot Conservatives Association, said that her remarks were inappropriate but said they won't be calling for her resignation. \nDespite using the racist term, none of her fellow panelists, including Tory MPs Bill Cash and John Redwood, reacted to the comment. \nRead more on Anne Marie Morris: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-07-12T14:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-07-12T15:46:24.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
