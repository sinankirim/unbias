It's a great opportunity for me and for Plymouth.\" \nMrs Hayman said: \"Luke has only been an MP for six weeks but already in that time he has been a powerful advocate of the fishing interests in Plymouth. \n\"I've also been impressed by his vision for Plymouth Sound to be designated as the country's first National Marine Park. \n\"I'm delighted that Luke has joined the shadow Defra team as my PPS. \n\"With the Government's handling of the environment and fisheries seriously in doubt I need a first class team and that is exactly what we now have.\" \nParliamentary Private Secretaries are appointed by a minister to be his or her assistant. \nThey are selected from backbench MPs as the 'eyes and ears' of the minister in the House of Commons.
