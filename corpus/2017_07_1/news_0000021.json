She was absent from her planned surgery at the Passmore Edwards Centre in the town and passers-by and journalists were told that it had been cancelled. \nBut it was later confirmed that the surgery had gone ahead after all, at an undisclosed location, on Thursday morning. A spokesman for the under-fire MP said: \"The surgery did go ahead today. However on advice it was relocated. All those that were attending the surgery were informed.\" \nIt was not clear where it was held, or on whose advice it had been moved. \nThe MP, who has been stripped of the Conservative party whip after being recorded making a racist remark, had been due to meet constituents at one of her regular sessions at the Passmore Edwards Centre. \nREAD MORE: Supporter says it has been 'a lot of negative publicity and grossly unfair criticism' \nHowever, there was no sign of Ms Morris at the centre, where staff said the surgery had been called off. There was no news of any cancellation or rearrangement on Ms Morris' website ahead of the surgery. Her Twitter feed has not been updated since the n-word controversy broke, and neither has her Facebook page. \nMs Morris hit headlines worldwide when she was recorded describing the UK leaving the EU without a deal as a \"real n r in the woodpile\" at the launch of a report into the future for the UK's lucrative financial sector after Brexit. She has since apologised for the remarks, saying: \"The comment was unintentional and I apologise unreservedly for any offence caused.\" \nBut she has had the whip suspended by the Conservative Party, which means that although she is still an MP, she is no longer a Conservative MP. Local Tories have said they support her, and have described the issue as 'a storm in a teacup'. However, there have also been calls for her to resign. \nCOMMENT: Why it's hard to see a way forward for Anne Marie Morris after this \nSome supporters made their voices heard outside the Passmore Edwards Centre. Steve Brookes said he had come to show his support in Latin, saying 'nil desperandum', or do not despair, and 'illegitimi non carborundum', or don't let the bastards grind you down. \nHe added: \"This is a total storm in a teacup. If this is all this country has got to worry about, then God help us all.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-07-13T18:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-07-13T19:21:17.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
