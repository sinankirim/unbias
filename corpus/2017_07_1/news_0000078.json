Quorn can be made to mimic mince, bacon, burgers, sausages, chicken or ham. Quorn is available in 15 countries. \nQuorn Foods, now owned by a Filipino company, says it is investing £150m to double production at its main plant in Teeside and expects to create 300 new jobs there in the next five years. \n\"We are proud to be contributing to the UK's export drive and to be investing in a British innovation that is vital to addressing the future need for protein across a growing global population,\" said Quorn chief executive Kevin Brennan. \n\"Our growth will continue as expected, regardless of the Brexit deal that is reached. \n\"In fact, today's investment is indicative of our confidence in becoming a billion-dollar brand in the next 10 years.\" \nThe firm, which has been owned by Monde Nissin of the Philippines since 2015, says it made a pre-tax operating profit of £13.7m in the first six months of 2017. \nQuorn Foods has 650 employees on three UK sites and internationally: Stokesley in North Yorkshire, Billingham on Teesside and Methwold in Norfolk, as well as Frankfurt in Germany and Chicago in the US. \nDevonLive Home Page or read more Devon News here \n\">DEVON NEWS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-07-24T11:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-07-24T13:26:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
