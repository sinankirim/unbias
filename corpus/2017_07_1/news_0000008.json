Pole Arnold's Richard Todd \nRichard Todd, director of Pole Arnold, said the firm was “once again delighted to be involved in the Leicester Mercury Women in Business Awards”. \nHe said: “Over half of our team are female, which include our three senior managers as well as a senior adviser, and we feel privileged to be sponsoring the Entrepreneur of the Year Award. \n“We have first-hand experience of the women within our team’s entrepreneurial contribution to our own business. \n“Team work is essential in our business and if asked I would like to think that all of the women working for us feel that they are encouraged to bring entrepreneurial skills to their work. Pole Arnold logo \n“There are plenty of female role models in the entrepreneur space although it appears we still seem to have some way to go before reaching equilibrium. P \n“Politically, a case in point being the two negotiating teams for the Brexit negotiations are currently predominately male. \n“Clearly there will be plenty of challenges for female entrepreneurs as our Brexit negotiations progress. \n“Theresa May will certainly have to use her entrepreneurial skills over the coming months to help steer the UK through the significant challenges ahead and to keep our economy growing.” \nHe added: “It was clear from the high quality of entries last year that there are many entrepreneurial women in Leicestershire and we are looking forward to meeting this year’s Entrepreneur of the Year candidates.
