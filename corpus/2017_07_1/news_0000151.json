I will make the case for an efficient and affordable rail and bus network that promotes economic growth, protects the interests of the travelling public and delivers value for the taxpayer.” \nOnly Labour MPs are able to stand for the post, because committee chair positions are divided up between the parties before candidates come forward. \nHowever, MPs from all parties are able to vote, which means Ms Phillipson, along with the other candidates, needs to try to win support from Tory as well as Labour MPs and those from other parties. Gateshead MP Ian Mearns \nGateshead MP Ian Mearns is standing again to be chair of the Backbench Business Committee, which helps decide what gets debated in the House of Commons.

Lord Beecham (Image: newcastle chronicle) \nLord Beecham, a former leader of Newcastle City Council, continues as a Communities and Local Government spokesman in the House of Lords and Darlington MP Jenny Chapman is a shadow Brexit minister. \nSouth Shields MP Emma Lewell-Buck is a shadow children and families minister, while Newcastle Central MP Chi Onwurah continues as shadow minister for the industrial strategy. \nNorth Tyneside MP Mary Glindon is a shadow farming minister and Stockton South MP Alex Cunningham MP is a shadow pensions minister. \nThey join North East MPs in high profile and senior roles include Middlesbrough MP Andy McDonald, the Shadow Secretary of State for Transport, Newcastle upon Tyne East MP Nick Brown, the Opposition Chief Whip, and Wansbeck MP Ian Lavery, the Labour chair and joint election co-ordinator.
