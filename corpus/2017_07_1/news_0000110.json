Read More Women in Business Awards 2017 - nominations now open \nEstablishing the need for a physical textiles and fashion hub in Leicester was one of the key objectives set out in the Leicester and Leicestershire Textiles Sector Growth Plan, published by LLEP in June 2015. \nIn December 2016, the LLEP commissioned Focus Consultants to carry out research and canvas the views of industry leaders on the possibility of a physical hub in Leicester. \nThe study, which was part-funded by the LLEP's ERDF Technical Assistance Programme and Leicester City Council, recognises the strengths and weaknesses of the textiles manufacturing sector in Leicester and Leicestershire, and scopes the potential to launch a textiles hub while exploring the possibilities of deliverability, location, size, cost, image, form and function and sustainability. Read More \nSome of the main findings include: \nThe sector employs 9,500 jobs in 1,480 businesses. \nUK manufacturing offers important advantages around flexibility and speed. \nMacroeconomic changes such as exchange rates, Brexit and discussions on trade deals are also influencing reshoring of manufacturing back to the UK. \nThe textiles sector is much wider than fashion. However, it is clear there is a will and opportunity at this time to address some of the issues facing the fashion textiles sector as a first phase of the Textiles Hub. \nFocus Consulting has also prepared a mission statement for the Hub which is: \"To support the development of a robust, future-focused, highly skilled and sustainable fashion and textiles sector with high quality jobs in Leicester and the UK.\" \nNick Pulley, chairman of the LLEP, said: \"The fashion and textiles sector is very important to the local economy. \n\"There is a great passion from industry leaders to pursue a Textiles and Fashion Hub and this textiles report is a fantastic starting point. \n\"A Textiles and Fashion Hub would provide opportunities and facilities for research, development, innovation, collaboration with universities, colleges and skills training.\" Like us on Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-06-26T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-07-19T13:16:24.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
