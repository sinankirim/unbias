Since then the video has been branded mad, crazy and the 'most over-the-top and enthusiastic PMQs ever'. \nThis week Morris was recorded using the offensive phrase \"n in the woodpile\" during a meeting of eurosceptics in central London at Monday lunchtime. \nFor many, it was the first time the backbench MP for Devon had made headlines beyond her West country constituency. But in fact, Morris' national profile was raised during Prime Minister's Questions in 2012. As she sat down the PM at the time David Cameron laughed and said: \"It's very good to see the honourable lady on such feisty form!\" \nThis week Morris was at a meeting of eurosceptics when she described the UK leaving the EU without a deal as a \"real n r in the woodpile\" at the launch of a report into the future for the UK's lucrative financial sector after Brexit. \nShe told Devon Live: \"The comment was unintentional and I apologise unreservedly for any offence caused.\" \nBut she has had the whip suspended meaning that although she remains an MP, she is no longer a Conservative MP. And now it is reported that she has lost the chairmanship of an influential Parliamentary group because of her use of the N-word. The suspended Conservative MP was set to be named chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group for South West Rail today, but BBC reports that the proposed appointment has now been called off. \nPrime Minister Theresa May said: \"I was shocked to hear of these remarks, which are completely unacceptable. I immediately asked the chief whip to suspend the party whip. Language like this has absolutely no place in politics or in today's society.\" Return to the DevonLive Home Page or read more Devon News here \nRead more at http://www.devonlive.com/devon-mp-loses-parliamentary-chairmanship-thanks-to-n-word-remark-says-bbc/story-30433647-detail/story.html#gjo8SqPpJXkRfIyZ.99", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-07-11T15:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-07-11T10:12:59.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
