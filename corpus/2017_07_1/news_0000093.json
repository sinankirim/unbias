It takes the total budget for the project to £39.92m. \nThe contract with a construction company would be at a fixed price, meaning costs would not be allowed to increase. \nThe announcement follows a best and final offer from contractors hoping to build the new facilities on behalf of the council. \nThe council say a variety of factors are to blame for the cost being a lot more than the original estimate made by the council's external advisors. \nThe current agreed budget of £32.25m is already fully funded. The proposed increase in the budget would mean £6.27m would need to come from borrowing from Central Government or a bank. \nBut the council has defended the cost of borrowing, claiming it will be 'more than covered by the income St Sidwell's Point will generate.' \nCouncillor Phil Bialyk, lead councillor with responsibility for bus station redevelopment, said: \"We've taken our time to get this right. We said we'd deliver, and even in difficult times we plan to do just that. \n\"This is about civic pride and setting the right tone for the continued redevelopment of the city centre. It is also about providing the quality buildings and quality services that people expect and deserve. \nReturn to Devon Live home page or read next: Gang gets 70 years for drugs war stabbing in Exeter \n\"The budget to deliver these developments is more than we first thought, but that's not unusual post the Brexit vote and with the uncertainty over the economy that continues. \n\"But the project has been independently assessed as being value for money. And we absolutely think the investment in the city will be worth every penny. \n\"It will help to ensure the long term viability of the city centre, which is responsible for generating a huge number of jobs, and it will provide the residents of Exeter with facilities worthy of our great city for many decades to come.\" \nTory opposition in the city met on Friday afternoon to discuss the shock news. \nCllr Andrew Leadbetter, leader of Exeter Conservatives, said: \"We are absolutely flabbergasted. We thought this project was expensive before, now it is nearly £40m and they haven't even started building it. \n\"The city council has spent nearly £4m for consultancy fees already, and hasn't got a bucket of water to show for it. \n\"The Tories in Exeter have always agreed that we need a new pool, but we were unhappy with the original proposal of £18m.\" \n\"It is time for a rethink this vanity project of theirs, and we really call upon Labour members to think about what is best for our city. This is a crazy amount of money to spend on a project and we'd see no other projects funded in the city.\" \nCllr Leadbetter added: \"The council must have Jeremy Corbyn's 'Magic Money Tree' growing somewhere.\" \nLiberal Democrat Cllr Kevin Mitchell said: \"The original budget for this Leisure Centre was £20 million in December 2014 and today it is recommended the budget be set at £33.05 million. \n\"These costs have spiralled upwards without a single brink being laid. We are not dealing with monopoly money, this is taxpayers money and the public deserve better. \n\"Bins are overflowing in my ward because the Council do not have the operatives to empty them regularly, rubbish is left in our streets because we don't have sufficient street sweepers, graffiti is out of control despite the valiant efforts of a small team and no fixed penalty fines have been issued in the last three years for littering or dog fouling because we no longer have the officers to enforce clean streets. \n\"I get told again and again we don't have the money to ensure these basics occur yet money keeps being found for this project, this time from borrowing. Clearly this project is a priority for our Labour Councillors but it is time they got the basics right first.\" \nBelow: We asked Exeter City Council tough questions on today's announcement \nFollowing the Leisure Complex and Bus Station Programme Board on Monday, July 10, the city council's Executive will meet on Tuesday, July 11, and will be asked to approve the recommendation made. A final decision would then be made at a meeting of the full council on Wednesday, July 19. \nThe project is seen as central to the wider redevelopment of the area, in partnership with the Crown Estate. \nThe private sector developer has planning permission to create a £75m leisure extension of Princesshay, including a mix of new shops, a cinema, restaurants, cafes, public open space and an amphitheatre at the site. It would lead to the creation of 750 new jobs. \nIf given the go-ahead by councillors, the city council would sign a contract with a building contractor later in the summer, and work could start on St Sidwell's Point and a new Exeter Bus before the end of the year. \nThat would mean the closure of the current bus station, and the introduction of the temporary bus arrangements to enable services to continue operating smoothly. \nPassengers would be dropped off and picked up at especially created bus stands in the city centre. \nThe redevelopment of the bus station site has been a top council priority for the last two decades - seen as being a crucial element in supporting and investing in the city centre, where 20,000 people work. \nThe state-of-the-art St Sidwell's Point leisure complex features an eight lane main pool and four lane pool for learners, both with moveable floors. \nThere is also a confidence pool, 150 station gym, soft play area, café and crèche as well as extensive health and spa facilities. Due to ultra-filtration, the pools will have exceptional water quality with minimal chemical content. \nIt will be the UK's first leisure centre, built to super-efficient low energy Passivhaus standards, saving around 70 per cent on annual fuel costs. \nThe new Exeter Bus Station will replace the existing bus station which opened in 1964.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-07-01T11:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-07-01T16:44:23.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
