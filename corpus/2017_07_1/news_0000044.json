Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nNewcastle United have been told they must shatter their 12-year-old transfer record if they hope to lure Villarreal striker Cedric Bakambu to Tyneside, according to reports. \nThe 26-year-old Democratic Republic of Congo striker has scored 23 goals in 57 La Liga appearances over the past two seasons and West Ham United are believed to have already seen a £22million bid for Bakambu rejected this summer. \nA report in The Sunday People claims that, should Newcastle hope to sign the French-born forward, the Magpies will need to pay well in excess fo £22m. \nGiven that United’s transfer record of £17m has stood for a dozen years - that was the fee Newcastle paid Real Madrid to sign Michael Owen back in 2005 - it will mean Mike Ashley will have to spend significantly more on a single acquisition than he has during his decade-long stint as Magpies owner.
