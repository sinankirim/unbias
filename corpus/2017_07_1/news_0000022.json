X \nCopy link to paste in your message / Comments (0) \nChurches have been broken into and ransacked in a spate of burglaries. \nThe Diocese of Exeter is alerting all its churches to be on their guard after the break-ins, which have occurred overnight over the last two weeks. \nHuge damage estimated to run into tens of thousands of pounds has been done to stained glass windows and internal doors and cupboards, as the culprits seek computers and other valuables. \nRead More: Newton Abbot MP Anne Marie Morris 'suddenly turned into' BNP leader Nick Griffin, MPs told \nDevon and Cornwall Police have confirmed that several churches have been targeted in the last few weeks by heartless thieves who steal donation money and items from the church. \nPolice are investigating burglaries in Sidmouth parish church, Teignmouth St Michael, Mount Dinham Exeter, Crediton Holy Cross, Holy Trinity Exmouth, Highweek Newton Abbot, Exeter St Thomas and Ashburton St Andrew's. \nThe desecration has not been confined to Anglican places of worship with a Catholic church in Tavistock also hit last week. \nAn ancient relic - the bone of a saint, Pope Pius 10th - one of many items stolen from Tavistock's Roman Catholic Church. \nA total of £45 in cash and the silver pot, which contained the religious artefact, were stolen during the burglary overnight of July 1. \nRead More: Why £400M- a-year Exeter Uni is thinking twice over Brexit \nFather John Greatbatch, of Our Lady of the Assumption and Mary Magdalen, said the theft had been carried out by children who made off with the safe and the reliquary. \n\"From what we can gather they went into a neighbour's garden, stole a ladder and put it up to a window,\" he told Devon Live. \n\"The whole was only 11 to 13 inches so it must have been children - the police reckon it is. They were probably after money but luckily they left all the silver so we were quite lucky in that respect.\" \nLouise Bartlett, senior Church Buildings Adviser for the Church of England's Diocese of Exeter, said: \"In each case, the perpetrator is breaking in through stained glass windows and damaging doors to try and find valuables like computers and projectors. \n\"The damage done to some of our historic churches has been extensive.\" \n\"It is very upsetting that our churches, which are at the centre of their communities and serve and support so many community groups and individuals, are being targeted in this way. \n\"We are alerting all our churches to be on their guard and do all they can to remove valuables from the premises.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-07-12T17:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-07-12T18:01:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
