Rachel Peacock, networks manager at Digital Union (Image: Unknown) \nRachel Peacock, Digital Union’s networks manager, said: “The thought of highly-skilled EU workers potentially leaving the country over the next five years is worrying. \n“There are a substantial number of EU nationals within the creative digital sector who are significantly contributing to the growth and success of the sector and businesses within. \n“With the skills shortage challenge being as prevalent as it already is, it’s crucial that businesses within the UK have access to the wider talent pool, as, without this, we are only creating further barriers. \n“These highly skilled digital roles are more often than not, difficult to fill with UK nationals and until that changes with the further upskilling of our own domestic workforce, that issue is only going to worsen.” Read More North East businesses overwhelming want EU trading deals to remain unchanged \nLast month a survey of skilled workers at FTSE 250 companies found that more than half were either ‘highly likely’ or ‘quite likely’ to leave the UK before the outcome of the Brexit negotiations was known, with healthcare, technology, media and telecoms and financial services the sectors likely to be hardest hit. \nThe difficult issue of the rights of EU citizens in the UK - and Britons on the continent - is one of the first tasks facing negotiators in the Brexit talks. \nMrs May’s plan would allow EU nationals resident in the UK to apply for “settled status” - effectively guaranteeing them indefinite leave to remain in the country once Britain is out of the bloc. \nBut MEPs have said there were “striking” differences between the UK’s offer and that set out by the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier who “wants British people and Europeans to keep the same rights and the same level of protection they currently enjoy”. \nAward-winning Gateshead firm Atomhawk - which employs people from around the world - has added its voice to the debate and said that protecting EU workers’ rights was vital for the economy.

Atomhawk’s team is drawn from the UK, EU and beyond. \n“Our ability to attract and retain the world’s best concept artists and designers has been crucial in helping us shape an award-winning team. \n“If the UK is to continue to appear ‘open for business’ the Government needs to reflect that in the way that it welcomes and retains talent from the EU and beyond.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-07-10T14:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-07-10T16:02:04.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
