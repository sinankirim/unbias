She is prepared to sacrifice herself although we shall not ask for this lightly - only as a last measure. \n\"We did set off a practice device in the old Redruth Brewery and are responsible for the two fires in Truro and the one in Penryn. \n\"We have also issued warnings to owners of holiday businesses flying the blood cross flag.\" \nIt also said it will continue its action against second homes owned by \"the English\". \nThe CRA also posted an announcement on the blog says that it is pleased to announce substantial funding from the other Celtic Countries and from Irish groups in the United States of America. \nRead more: Campaigners say Brexit will mean more dead dolphins will be found on Devon's beaches \nIt also claims to have welcomed members from the Free Wales Army ( FWA ), the Scottish National Liberation Army ( SNLA ) and members of the Irish National Liberation Army ( INLA ) and the now defunct Provisional Irish Republican Army (Provisional IRA). \nThe Cornish Republic Army says it has limited weapons available but intends to rely on more controlled methods to achieve its aims. \nWhile it appears to want to be taken very seriously, comments on the Cornwall Live Facebook page would indicate that the reaction has been far from it. \nThis story first appeared on Cornwall Live which has decided not to publish a direct link to the blog involved.
