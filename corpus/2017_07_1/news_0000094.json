Get an employer to sponsor you \nOne method is to find an employer who will pay for you to study. \nEssentially, they’re investing in you and you repay by working for them during study breaks or when you graduate. \nSometimes this involves a week split between studying and working, or you could be studying full time with a guaranteed job at the end and summer work. That also means you’ll already have a good CV when you graduate , and will be ahead of your course mates who spent uni holidays sleeping until 1pm. 2. Degree apprenticeships \nThese are similar to sponsored degrees, but the Government helps fund part of the programme. You will definitely have to work while you study, but you’ll get a salary too. Usually degree apprenticeships, which have been embraced by companies like GlaxoSmithKline, will require you to spend 80% of your time working on the job. You’ll finish with a full degree though. \nTo find out more about degree apprenticeships and availability, visit UCAS here . 3. Study abroad The fees are lower in other parts of the EU (Photo: PA) \nCurrently there are opportunities to study for free - or very cheaply - in France, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Austria, Greece and many more institutions around the world. \nIn France students in the EU can apply to the Grandes Écoles for free or a very low fee, usually around £150 a year. This is not a recognised university, but the courses on offer do cover primary subjects such as business, maths and science. \nAustrian universities guarantee EU students the same rights as Austrians, so tuition fees are as low as £300 a term, with some semesters free of charge. \nYou may need to speak German though, although Masters courses are sometimes taught in English. \nIn Spain, you’d pay between £570 - £1,180 a year. That’s a lot less than £9,000 we pay here. \nAct fast though, Brexit could make things more difficult as Brits will no longer be EU citizens. 4. Crowdfunding \nThis won’t work for everybody, but there are examples of students who have successfully set up fundraising pages to get people to chip in for their degree costs. \nBut it’s best to have a worthy back story, or offer something in return. \nOne successful crowdfunding student, Sarah Atayero from Luton managed to raise over £6,000 from 210 ‘backers’ to help with her MSc at King’s College London. \nThe undergraduate put a call out after deciding to specialise in affective disorders and mental health after completing her degree - incredibly, the generosity of her followers helped her reach her target. 5. Further Education (FE) college \nYour local college may offer degrees which are much cheaper than what you’d pay at a university. They won’t always be free, but they will be much cheaper. \nAnd, your degree will be awarded by a university partnered with the college. \nThere are currently 209 FE colleges in England teaching around 153,000 students a year.
