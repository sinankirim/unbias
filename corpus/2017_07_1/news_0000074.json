LSL therefore expects to report strong interim results on August 1 ahead of the board’s expectations and significantly ahead of the same period last year, with the estate agency division performing ahead of the board’s expectation and delivering strong growth in lettings and financial services income, and with a strong performance by the surveying division.” \nThe firm added: “As a result, the board anticipates that full year 2017 group underlying operating profit will be materially ahead of its prior expectations, with a more equal weighting between the first and second half compared to prior years.” \nLast August the firm posted strong half-year results, in which its turnover grew by 8% to £151.4m, and pre-tax profits soared 35% to £8.4m. \nInitially LSL had said that the UK’s decision to leave the EU could impact its results but so far the business seems to have remained unscathed by Brexit.

In April 2017 the firm said that house sales had dipped during the first quarter of the year. \nBut rather than blaming the drop in sales on Brexit, LSL said its numbers looked weak compared to the first three months of 2016 when buyers surged to purchase houses in the run-up to a change in stamp duty regulations. \nLSL’s share price has soared following the announcement.
