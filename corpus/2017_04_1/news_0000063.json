But by who and of what? \nOn Thursday came the chilling answer when Brexit ‘supremo’ David Davis said that up to 1,000 laws will be introduced through “statutory instruments”. Brexit Secretary David Davis \nThis means, as Davis admitted, that many of these laws would not face proper debate. In other words the country hasn’t regained control, it has just been handed it over to the executive without full scrutiny of the House of Commons. \nI’m not the only one who suspects the biggest victim when laws go through on the nod will be workers’ rights - such as they are now - closely followed by the environment. \nWhen the UK joined the EU in 1973, it was dubbed the ‘dirty man of Europe’ because of its out of control pollution. \nWith the influence of climate change deniers in the right wing press and the Tory habit of ditching ‘red tape’ - ie regulations - to the benefit of its supporters, expect Lindisfarne’s Fog on the Tyne to make a comeback. \nBut to worry about all these things is to be a bad lose or to be doing Britain down. Those who were - and still are - against Brexit are supposed to suck it in and get over it.
