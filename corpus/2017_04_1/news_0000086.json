You have Plymouth versus Exeter or Devon versus Cornwall but it should be Plymouth and Exeter, Devon and Cornwall. \n\"People tend to think they are missing one crucial thing which will make the difference, but that might actually be the fact that there are hundreds of businesses, that together become incredibly powerful with a much bigger voice.\" \nMr Moss explained that the best business decisions are disruptive and appeal to the emotions. \nAnd Brexit poses a massive opportunity for the region for new ideas and innovation. \nHe said: \"I am quite convinced that Brexit will bring disruption. A lot of people are asking 'what do we do now' but areas like the Northern Powerhouse are really grabbing it and this area has to do the same. \n\"We can create a catalyst by bring together the people who are passionate about this place.\" \nMr Moss said he 'flip-flopped' over Brexit but said that now the decision is made, to get on with it. \n\"We will look back in 25 years time and see it wasn't just the biggest decision but the greatest opportunity. \n\"What does the South West do well? It's food, drink, technology and music. These are the things of life and the creativity that's down here really is amazing. \n\"Kent calls itself the bread basket of England, but why have they taken that title? It should be Devon and Cornwall.\" \nCornwall this week submitted its bid to create a UK Spaceport at Newquay Airport. \nMr Moss said he has an ambition to go to space and shared former boss Sir Richard Branson's ambitions for space travel. \nBranson founded Virgin Galactic in 2004 with the aim of becoming the world's first commercial operator for space tourism. \nIt operates Spaceport America in New Mexico and offers future astronauts the chance to sign up for a future mission for $250,000. \nMr Moss said: \"In the span of a lifetime we will see space tourism. If you think about air travel fifty years ago, to go to the states cost a huge amount of money. Now people go to New York for the weekend, it's become normal. \n\"And it will be the same with space travel, future generations will be going to the moon for the weekend.\" \nHe said that ambitions only become reality with taking risks but big businesses are reluctant to take those. \nHe said: \"As businesses get bigger, they get safer but that is the opposite of what they should be doing. They should be taking more risks, disrupting more markets. \n\"If you think of any company that has got the word British in it, they have been doing things more of less the same way for years, businesses that have a crack at taking that market share are more fun in my mind,\" he said. \nAnd he rallied against using big data to justify decisions. \nHe said: \"Your decisions may be safer but how can they be better than anyone else's who have access to the same data, are going for the same market in the same way. \n\"I have been to so many meetings when my gut has told me the answer and we need to encourage people to make more of that.\" \nThe Like Minds Ideas Festival is being held in Exeter on September 29.
