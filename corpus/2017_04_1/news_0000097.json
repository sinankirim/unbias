Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA very literary weekend approaches with both Hexham Book Festival and Newcastle Noir being launched today. \nThe latter is the annual Newcastle crime writing festival which takes place at the Lit & Phil, at the bottom of Westgate Road. \nThere’s a free launch event at 7pm tonight attended by Denise Mina whose latest book, The Long Drop, is a psychological thriller based on the case of Scotland’s first convicted serial killer. \nThis was Peter Manuel who was born in New York to Scottish parents but came back to Scotland as a child. \nHe was convicted of murdering seven people – and may have shot and killed a Newcastle taxi driver, Sydney Dunn, in December 1957 although he was never tried for the murder. \nManuel was hanged in Barlinnie Prison, Glasgow, on July 11, 1958, aged 31. \nThe festival continues throughout Saturday and Sunday with a series of panel sessions on different aspects of crime writing – including Geordie Crime, Femmes Fatales, Children’s Crime Fiction and Tartan Noir. Crime writer Mari Hannah (Photo: Macmillan.co.uk) \nAmong the authors attending the festival are Howard Linskey, LJ Ross, Lin Anderson, Mari Hannah, Katherine Woodfine and CL Taylor. \nTwo sessions dedicated to Nordic Crime will feature writers from Scandinavia including Kjell Ola Dahl, from Denmark, Antti Tuomainen, from Finland, and Erik Axl Sund, from Sweden (actually the pen name of two writers, Jerker Eriksson and Håkan Axlander Sundquist). \nThe festival also includes a Murderous Newcastle walking tour at 11am on Sunday led by city guide Pat Lowery. Meet at the Castle Keep. \nDetails of Newcastle Noir can be found at www.litandphil.org.uk or pick up a brochure at the Lit & Phil. \nHexham Book Festival is a rather longer affair, beginning today but running until May 7. \nDozens of writers from many different walks of life will be descending on the town but the poet Lemn Sissay gets the ball rolling at 7pm tonight with a session at the Queen’s Hall Arts Centre. Lemn Sissay, writer and broadcaster \nSissay, born in Wigan to a mother recently arrived from Ethiopia, published his first book of poems at the age of 17 and sold it to local people on the streets. \nHe will read from his latest poetry collection, Gold from the Stone. \nThe weekend brings an embarrassment of literary riches with Northumberland author Chloe Daykin hosting a workshop for children, journalist couple Polly Toynbee and David Walker discussing their book Dismembered and the world post-Brexit, Denise Welch talking about her novel If They Could See Me Now and Paul Morley waxing lyrical about his hero, David Bowie. \nThe BBC’s Frank Gardner, most often seen talking about the world’s trouble spots on the national news, will also be in Hexham on Saturday to discuss his novel, Crisis. Frank Gardner (Photo: liv.chapman@hotmail.com) \nAmong the writers coming to Hexham on Sunday are Louise Doughty, whose thriller Apple Tree Yard was recently adapted as a BBC One drama series and fellow novelists Salley Vickers and Michèle Roberts. \nAuthor and broadcaster Claudia Hammond will also be in Hexham to talk money. \nHer latest book is Mind over Money – The Psychology of Money and How to Use it Better. \nThat is just to scratch the surface of a packed Hexham programme but you will find every detail at www.hexhambookfestival.co.uk Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-04-28T19:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-04-28T15:36:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
