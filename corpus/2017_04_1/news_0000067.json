Exactly a quarter of a century later there should only be celebration when a side of largely home-grown cricketers walk out at their well-appointed Riverside ground, but the fact that for the first time in 12 years they will be playing in County Championship Division Two will sour the mood with bitterness. \nA game against Nottinghamshire at an international venue feels as much like First Division cricket as a Division Two game can get, but reality will quickly sink in. \nIn the 25 years since a team largely made up of journeymen pros and aspiring locals took to the field at Oxford University, Durham’s contribution to English cricket has been massive. \n“I think it gets glossed over a little bit too quickly what the club has achieved in that time,” says coach Jon Lewis. \n“It took Glamorgan (the previous club admitted to the First-Class scene) a hell of a lot longer to make an impact but Durham have won three Championships, two one-day trophies, reached two Twenty20 Finals Days, had a healthy England representation and provided stacks of North East guys with the opportunity to forge professional cricket careers without having to move away.” \nFourteen new players have signed up for the 2017 county season as “Kolpaks” or on European passports, rushing through the door before Brexit slams it shut. “Kolpak” status is a technicality which allows non-European players to count as natives, allowing overseas players to be added on top. Durham have not been averse to sneaking the odd player through that way, but it has not stopped their academy producing nine England internationals this century including the only English captain to lift a major global trophy (Paul Collingwood) and a world no.1-ranked bowler in Stephen Harmison. All but two were born in the North East.

A desire to compete got the better of their wage bill in the Noughties, but they had long since cut back that cloth. The main drain came from trying to keep the Riverside up to Test standard – a condition the ECB’s predecessors insisted on in return for First-Class status. \nBy October Durham’s debt was £7.5m – small beer compared to many Test-ground counties, but way beyond what they could manage. The ECB weighed in, clearing half the debt in return for relegation, a 48-point deduction in the 2017 Championship, the loss of Test-ground status, a tighter salary cap and other swingeing sanctions. Durham were left dangling until the county council picked up the tab for the other half of their borrowing. \nWithout the ECB Durham would not have had a 25th anniversary to celebrate, but there was an almost universal feeling that their treatment had been at best very harsh, at worst disgracefully shabby. Now that anger has to be channelled. \nDurham sat out the opening round but Notts did not, and already have a 70-point lead. poll loading Will Durham win promotion from the Second Division this season? 0+ VOTES SO FAR YES NO \n“It doesn’t add pressure but it’s probably more important that we get some good performances out of these first two games before we go into the one-day stuff,” Lewis acknowledges. “We need to get some points on the board and you would anticipate Nottinghamshire will be competing at the top of the table come the end of the season so this was always going to be a good game. To get a good start against them will give us confidence.” \nThe best way to stick two fingers up at the ECB would be with a trophy in their hands. To be docked the equivalent of two maximum-points wins makes winning Division Two even tougher in a season of two fewer games, and while there are deductions in both limited-overs competitions too it would not be beyond them to win one, particularly not when fuelled by feelings of injustice. \n“Hopefully we get a few more in on the Friday than we normally do,” says Lewis of the attendance Durham have cut ticket prices to attract. “The membership’s up this year, so that might be reflected. It will be nice for the players, a good feeling for them, but ultimately it’s about how we play. The players are pretty much focused on their jobs.” Read More Durham coach Jon Lewis: 'We need five or six to have their best season ever. It's quite do-able.' \nThe core of the side is intact and international cricket should wait until the season’s second half before picking off star performers. \nMark Stoneman and Scott Borthwick, 1,000-run scorers in the past three seasons, have left for Surrey but overseas opener Stephen Cook will help fill the gap before joining the England v South Africa Test series, along with Keaton Jennings, in July. Others will have to step up too, and Esh Winning’s 20-year-old right-hander Jack Burnham is the man they are looking to. \nAt the other end of the scale, captain Collingwood will still have a big part to play despite turning 41 in May. Fortunately his desire burns as brightly as ever. \nThe bowling as usual is in good shape. Chris Rushworth and Graham Onions are quality new-ball performers who should be far too good for Division Two batsmen. Paul and Josh Coughlin, Brydon Carse, Barry McCarthy and James Weighell have great promise but, like Mark Wood, poor fitness records.

Born in County Durham 25 years ago on Monday, Pringle is a perfect example of why pioneers such as Don Robson poured so much of their lives into getting the 19th Century club to the pinnacle. \nEnglish cricket should be eternally grateful they did, even if its governing body has a funny way of showing it. \nDURHAM (from): Jennings, Cook, Burnham, Richardson, Steel, Collingwood (c), Pringle, Poynter, P Coughlin, Wood, Onions, Rushworth, Carse Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-04-14T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-04-14T08:08:06.958+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
