For instance, in these days of continent-wide migration and (so Brexiteers would assure us) an impending immigration crisis, it’s comforting to encounter evidence of just how secure our borders and our passports are. \nMy Northumberland neighbour has never held a full passport, but plans to travel to the Battlefields with her sisters in search of the grave of her great uncle, so now she requires one. \nShe was brought up in Yorkshire, she spent her 20s and most of her 30s on Tyneside, and has lived in North Northumberland for another two decades. She filled in the passport application form and, indeed, used me as a referee (they still seem to like headteachers and vicars on those forms!). \nTo her surprise, just this week she was summoned to Edinburgh for an interview. I didn’t know such things occurred; I’ve never had a problem renewing my passport. But nowadays it appears there’s digging to be done if someone who’s never possessed a passport suddenly applies for one. \nWe friends couldn’t resist pulling her leg, asking her who the current prime minister is and whether she knows all three verses of the national anthem. Then we realised we were quoting a probably apocryphal dementia test. Or the cub scouts. \nWould they question my friend’s motives for wanting a passport? What purer patriotic motive could there be, she complained, than seeking the grave of a relative who gave his life for king and country in the First World War ? \nHow should she prove her Britishness? She’d already submitted her birth certificate; what more could be required? Was her reaction just the attack of nerves usual before any interview? Was her worry fuelled by the alarmist talk surrounding Brexit? Or by the case of Irene Clennell, married to a Scotsman for 27 years but recently deported to Singapore because she’d spent 18 months nursing a dying mother back in the country of her birth? Read More Brexit is not irreversible so don't let anyone tell you otherwise, says Mike Kelly \nDid they suspect she’d somehow been radicalised in Alnwick or Wooler, and was using her Battlefields trip as cover for a bid to slip off and join the Popular Front for the Liberation of Galashiels? (Hold on: she wouldn’t need a passport for that yet – not until Scottish independence, anyway). \nWhat would happen if she didn’t pass the interview? Would she be deported back to … well, where? Darkest North Yorkshire? Perhaps she’d be confined to house arrest somewhere in Ryedale, her old stamping-ground. \nTruth is rarely stranger than fiction. The reality proved mundane – but oddly reassuring. The questions took the shape of a conversation, though one that carefully and cleverly elicited information from her that could be double-checked against her application and any other details they possessed. When my friend confessed that we’d all been winding her up, the interviewer smiled and observed quietly that its purpose was as much to protect her identity (to check that a stranger hadn’t illegally tried to get a passport in her name) as to check up on her. \nThere was no passing or failing (as we knew there wouldn’t be), nor any kind of Britishness test. Her solid Yorkshire ancestry and Northumbrian credentials remain unchallenged. There is not a single blot on her escutcheon and her passport should arrive any day. \nJoking apart, and odd as it seemed initially, it’s reassuring to know such checks exist. Indeed, they’ve been around for a decade or more.

That’s how security should be and, in truth, it’s how we mostly want our lives to be. The greatest excitement we seek is a ski holiday, a grandchild learning to walk, a celebration enjoyed. As recent tragic events in Westminster showed, we don’t desire big shocks, and certainly not nasty ones. \nQuietly, almost invisibly, these people are keeping us safe. In our cynical, typically British way, we can poke fun at the bureaucracy (as we did) but we can be grateful that it’s there. \nDr Bernard Trafford is the headmaster of the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle.
