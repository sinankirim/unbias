At the time, it said that if Labour returned to its roots ‘as an anti-EU party looking after the interests of domestic voters’ it could win. \nHowever, Mr Flynn told The Standard that following the announcment he felt Labout were about to ‘make a huge mistake’. \n“The issue here is the trade-off that people may make at the end of the day, They have got to come to an overall decision on how much of Brexit they want and whether its a major issue in their choice of party in the General Election.” \nHe said that if Jeremy Corbyn chose to downplay Brexit in favour of the NHS or Education that could have an effect on his party’s chances. \nChoice Modelling is a Nobel-Prize-winning form of survey which is said to give far greater insights into national attitude. \nMr Flynn has written a textbook on the method.
