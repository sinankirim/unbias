Campaigners behind #BackTheSouthWest say that Prime Minister Theresa May and leaders of Labour, Jeremy Corbyn and Lib Dems, Tim Farron, must make the region a priority port of call during the campaign trail and make good on their promises if they are to win our votes. \nAnd it is vital that the region makes the most of the opportunity the election brings by speaking with a unified voice. Sarah Heald, Director of Corporate Affairs at Pennon - a key partner with the Western Morning News for the #BackTheSouthWest campaign, said: \"The election provides a fresh opportunity for the party leaders themselves to visit and tell us exactly what they can offer us in terms of regional growth. \nRead next: Why prosperity in Devon and Cornwall can't wait for government hand outs \n\"Bring us a meaningful offering, and you will find a region willing, able and committed to building a better economic future for those who live and work here.\" \nParliament is due to break on May 3 to allow for the campaigning to begin ahead of the general election on Thursday, June 8.The #BackTheSouthWest campaign, launched and run in conjunction with major businesses and interest groups in the region, is designed to put the case for proper investment in the Westcountry alongside our own pledges to create prosperity in the region. \nLaunched last year, the campaign has led to the creation of the South West Growth Charter - debated in parliament and delivered to Downing Street.Since then, a South West Leaders' Forum has been established to make that vision a reality. \nAnd plans are in place to create a prospectus for the South West, together with the region's Local Enterprise Partnerships. \nRead next: South West is ready to grow as new Brexit era dawns \nMichael Beadel, Chairman of Stephens Scown LLP, one of the partners in the #BackTheSouthWest campaign, said: \"This news means that it is crucial for the South West to speak with one voice, to ensure that our priorities and potential for growth are heard and understood by politicians of all parties. Now, more than ever, it is time to #BackTheSouth West. \n\"Many of our clients are SMEs or owner managed businesses, and they are ready to seize the opportunities that lie ahead. No doubt there will be challenges, but it is up to all of us to share the success that is already happening here and persuade the new government that with the right support we will continue to flourish.\" \nThe University of Exeter, a partner in the #BackTheSouthWest campaign, has a research portfolio of over £200million but investment is need to make the most of the opportunities available. \nRead next: Award recognition for the #BackTheSouthWest campaign \nSean Fielding, Director of Innovation, Impact and Business, said that universities play a critical role in thriving economies.
