Robert Seatherton, 20, went to a house in Quinta Close in Ellacombe in June last year but did not manage to steal anything. He had previously been convicted of breaking into the homes of two neighbours in South Molton to satisfy his ladies' shoe craving. \nThe judge at his latest hearing at Exeter Crown Court decided not to activate his suspended sentence because of the good progress he was making to change his ways. \nSeatherton pleaded guilty to committing the burglary in Torquay on June 24. \nProsecutor Nigel Wraith said: \"The entry was by way of his hand only. \n\"There was an open porch window and the occupier was sleeping downstairs recovering from an operation. At 11.50pm the occupier heard footsteps and thought it was a relative. The dog started barking and the footsteps went away again.\" \nFingerprints were found on the inside ledge of the porch window but nothing had been taken, he added. \n\"His hand had gone in but not much more than that,\" said Mr Wraith. \nThe court was told the defendant had previous convictions for burglary. \nIn 2015 he was caught red-handed by a woman's 13-year-old son as he rifled through a cupboard and was seen by passers-by leaving a house with three pairs of shoes. \nThey were later found his bedroom. The owner of the shoes said she was so disgusted she never wanted to see them again. \nREAD MORE : Brexit 'may put travellers off flying' says new Flybe boss \nJudge Erik Salomonsen said he recalled the case and a defendant with a 'penchant for stealing shoes'. \nWilliam Parkhill, in mitigation, said Seatherton had been doing well since the court gave him a rehabilitation order as part of his last suspended sentence. A probation officer said she had rarely seen a defendant so enthusiastic about the courses he was now taking and the countryside placement work he was doing. \nJudge Salomonsen said: \"Clearly you have to be punished for going to Quinta Close. For whatever reason you were unable to steal anything.\" \nHe ordered the defendant, of Egerton Road, Torquay, to do 40 hours of unpaid work and complete 25 days on a Rehabilitation Activity Requirement. \nReturn to DevonLive homepage", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-04-12T23:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-04-12T20:08:50.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
