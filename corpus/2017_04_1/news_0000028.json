This is how businesses can get ahead Key ways businesses can get Brexit ready X \nCopy link to paste in your message / Nicola Mitchell-Rodd of Wolferstans Solicitors, Plymouth explains how to protect your business ahead of Brexit \nWith the Government having now triggered Article 50 the countdown has commenced and Britain should officially leave the EU by no later than April 2019. \nAs a nation we've entered into a period of uncertainty and although there is no way of telling what the future holds, businesses would be wise to employ strict credit control over the next few months when dealing with credit management, entering into new contracts and when dealing with suppliers to minimise their exposure to bad debt. \nIf your business relies heavily on goods which you import from suppliers based in other EU nations, you are more than likely already feeling the impact of the rise of inflation and the decreasing rate of the pound which has fallen against the euro to its lowest value in years. \nAdditional and unforeseen costs can often be the difference between surviving in an uncertain marketplace and falling victim to financial crisis and ultimately ceasing trading. It is also important to remember that whilst your business may be doing well, in times of recession there's a greater risk that your debtors may be struggling and this could have an adverse affect directly on your business and/or supply chain. \nAs the law currently stands there are reciprocal agreements and procedures in place which enables businesses to commence proceedings and obtain judgements against debtors and companies in other member states both here in the UK and abroad; unlike countries outside of the EU. Businesses also have the current benefit of being able to enforce against those debtors, in particular the ability to seize assets. \nHowever, it's uncertain what will happen to this legislation post-Brexit or even during the time in which agreements are under negotiation and whilst there are remedies currently available, commencing formal litigation to recover unpaid debts can be a lengthy processes even in the simplest of cases, often taking a minimum of 6 â€“ 12 months. \nOur advice is to be practical and take steps to protect your business now. With trading relationships set to change, review your businesses' policies, contracts and payment terms. Proactively chase unpaid invoices and do not defer taking steps to enforce against any existing unpaid Judgment debts. Stay cautious and thoroughly credit check your suppliers before entering into contracts with them. \nWith uncertain times ahead, one thing is key, as a business owner you'll need to remain vigilant and act swiftly on any changes to legislation as they develop. \nIf you would like more information or advice please call us on 01752 663295 or email info@wolferstans.com \nContent provided by Wolferstans ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-04-20T17:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-04-20T13:52:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
