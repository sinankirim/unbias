Rolando Aarons during a Newcastle United Training Session (Photo: Newcastle United) \nBenitez explained: “Rolando we have been speaking about a lot, because usually you expect from a cruciate-ligament injury for it to be six to eight months, but for Rolando after four months he is now doing full training sessions with the team. \n“We are really pleased with him but we don’t want to take any risks because we don’t have too many games left, so we will see and we will monitor him every day and see how he feels. \n“Then we can decide if he can play with the Under-23s or whatever, but we will not rush because we don’t need to and we don’t want to take the risk.” \nIsaac Hayden has recovered from his ankle injury and is in the squad to take on Wigan Athletic on Saturday, while Daryl Murphy and Grant Hanley could feature if they pass late assessments.
