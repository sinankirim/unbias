I realised within the first year of launching Gummee glove that we very much needed an over riding brand, to cover all products that we would bring to market. All we had at the time was the one product, and I realised that all though the product was doing very well, the name of that product would not be enough, to cover the other products. We needed a shorter, more distinct identity.\" \nJodie said that protecting IP has given huge amounts of confidence when looking for distributors, starting accounts with large retailers and monitoring the competition.\" \nGummee has just launched into the special needs market with a larger version of the Gummee glove, to help children with conditions that cause them to mouth their hands. \nShe is also writing her first book, which will be launched in October. \nJodie is among innovators behind some of the most recognisable brands in the Westcountry. \nOften, the biggest asset for names on the high street like Gummee Glove and St Austell Brewery in Cornwall and Luscombe Drinks in Devon is their IP - intellectual property. \nAnd protecting rights over their brand with trade marks, copyright and design rights means they can get the most of their brand in a global market place. \nBen Travers, partner and head of intellectual property and IT at Stephens Scown said: \"The success of the South West depends on entrepreneurs coming up with good ideas and having the courage to develop them. Intellectual property protection encourages innovation and helps businesses grow. Whether it is through trade mark registrations, copyright or registering design rights – there are several ways that businesses can protect their brands – which are often their most valuable assets.\" \nStephens Scown has a growing IP and IT team and was ranked among the top 100 firms filing trade marks in the UK and EU, achieving the highest ranking for a firm based in Devon and Cornwall. \nIt has helped a number of South West businesses protect their IP including St Austell Brewery, Lost Gardens of Heligan, Zero Carbon Future, Cornish Gems, Virtual Jet Centre and MC Kelly. \nStephens Scown is a key partner in the Western Morning News' #BackTheSouthWest campaign. \nMr Travers said: \"The success of the region depends on entrepreneurs coming up with good ideas and having the courage to develop them. IP protection encourages innovation and helps businesses grow.\" \nHe said that Brexit will mean that the UK will need to rethink its approach to this area, as currently many trade marks are registered across the EU. \n\"Done well, this could lead to opportunities for UK firms, but if mis-handled it could hamper growth,\" he said.
