BoJo was spotted dropping into a fat barrel at low-tide Croyde this morning, before coming ashore to speak to surfers and locals about the cleanliness of beaches. \nIn 2011 the European Union introduced tough new water quality standards for bathing beaches across the continent. After work by locals and firms such as South West Water, many of Devon's beaches are now much cleaner than they were before the directive. \nHowever, following the referendum in which Britain voted to leave the EU, many people are concerned that water quality on our beaches will slump once again. Mr Johnson, who arrived this morning for a day long visit, says he believes this is \"utter tosh\" and even caught a few waves to prove his confidence. \nSpeaking shortly after he emerged from the water wearing an ill-fitting and overly-revealing wetsuit, Mr Johnson said: \"Here in Devon, surfers like me want Great British sea water, and we don't want those oiks in Brussels dropping in on our great waves. \n\"I've been shredding the swell here for many years, and I have never once questioned how clean the water was. In fact, I suspect that once all that European water has been separated from our shores, it will actually improve the quality.\" \nHolidaymaker Avril Imbecile , who was visiting North Devon for today only, said she was impressed by Mr Johnson's surfing skills. She said: \"He was gnarly, no doubt about it! \n\"The look of sheer determination on his face was intimidating, but he ripped those slabs up like a pro. Yewwww!!!\" \nMr Johnson is not the only Tory to have enjoyed a spot of surfing in the South West. Former prime minister David Cameron was famously snapped on holiday in Cornwall - although he was only bodyboarding, which means Boris is clearly the superior man. RT if you agree that @David_Cameron should take a day off and go surfing in 30 foot #StormImogen waves. pic.twitter.com/WkfoZH7phZ â€” Will Black (@WillBlackWriter) February 8, 2016 \nBoris was later spotted dining out at Pesce D'Aprile , North Devon's premier Italian restaurant, where he is said to have ordered local seafood in yet another bid to prove that water quality in North Devon was just fine. \nHappy April first everyone.
