He called for the creation of an English Parliament , to match the parliaments and assemblies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. \nMr Nuttall was speaking to the Sunday Sun as the party launched its campaign for the 2017 general election on June 8, when it hopes to make gains in the North. \nThe House of Commons at Westminster should become a “Union chamber” dealing with issues such as defence and foreign policy, he said. \n“If the Union’s going to survive into the middle of this century then we’re going to have to have a fully federal UK.” \nHe added: “When devolution happened, Scotland got its own Parliament, Wales had its own assembly and Northern Ireland got [the assembly at] Stormont, but the English never truly got anything.” UKIP leader Paul Nuttall (Photo: PA) \nHe called for “an English parliament, A Scottish Parliament, a Welsh and a Northern Ireland assembly, and we have a Union chamber as well which deals with issues such as defence and foreign policy.” \nUKIP would scrap HS2 , the high speed rail line due to link London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds, and spend the money on local transport schemes instead, said Mr Nuttall. \nAnd he predicted HS2 would simply suck jobs out of other cities and into London. \nCritics have attacked the line because it misses the North East, heading north from Birmingham but stopping at Leeds. \nMr Nuttall said: “If you look at studies across she globe, whenever high speed rail connects a smaller city to the capital city, the smaller city always suffers.

It’s all there for the benefit of one place. \n“It’s a vanity project which I predict will cost taxpayers around £100 billion.” \nHe stood unsuccessfully in the Stoke Central by-election in February, but his campaign ran into difficulties when it emerged claims had appeared on his website which were untrue. \nThis included a claim that he lost close friends in the Hillsborough disaster in 1989.

It was pretty hard to take. \n“Not checking the website was my own fault. But that’s all it was, and I think a lot of it got blown out of all proportion. And the whole focus of the country’s political media in a way fell on my shoulders for over two weeks. \n“But in a way it made me stronger really.

I wouldn’t let it break me. And I knew I had a job to do afterwards, which was to restructure and rebuild the party and get it ready for this post-Brexit era.” \nMr Nuttall became known for dressing in tweed during the by-election. \nHe said this was how he usually dressed when he was not wearing an ordinary suit inside the European Parliament. \n“I have always dressed like that. For years. \n\"The only difference is, when you see me in Brussels you only ever see me inside, in front of a camera, in the European Parliament where I look pretty ridiculous. \n“In fact, even more ridiculous than I did wearing my tweed jacket and my flat cap. \n“But I’ve always dressed like that.” \nAsked where he bought his tweed jackets, he said: “Different places. Some online and some in shops. \n“But I do like my tweed.” Like us on Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-04-30T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-04-30T10:05:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
