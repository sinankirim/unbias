Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nMinisters will be asked to explain why North East schools face funding cuts, in a House of Commons debate. \nSharon Hodgson , MP for Washington and Sunderland West, has secured a debate on school cuts in the North East. \nIt follows claims that schools across the region are to lose £119 million in funding. \nThe Government has frozen the funding that schools receive per pupil - which means the money is actually cut in real terms, after inflation is taken into account. \nMinisters point out that total school funding is increasing , because pupil numbers are going up. \nBut critics say it’s the funding per pupil that matters, while schools also face a series of cost increases that they can’t control such as an increase in National Insurance contributions North East schools are faced with funding cuts (Photo: PA) \nIndependent spending watchdog the National Audit Office said in a major report in February that schools nationwide face a funding shortfall of £3bn. \nAnd the National Association of Headteachers (NAHT) says schools across the North East face a shortfall of £119 million, with schools in Newcastle set to lose £11.2m in real terms by 2019.

Schools in Durham will lose £20.3m, schools in North Tyneside will lose £8.9m and schools in South Tyneside will lose £4.8m, according to the NAHT. \nMrs Hodgson said she had asked for the debate following meetings with head teachers and school governors in Sunderland. \nShe said: “Parents and teachers have repeatedly raised with me their concerns about the future of our schools under the Tories, where schools are set to see a 6.5% to 8% real terms cut in their budgets, which will impact not only the financial viability of the schools but also the education of the children attending.
