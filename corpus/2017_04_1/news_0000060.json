(Photo: PA) KEY EVENT Boris Johnson's sister joins Lib Dems \nBoris Johnson’s fellow Brexiteers have been accused of selling “faulty goods” over their broken promises on Europe by his now-Liberal Democrat sister. \nRachel Johnson said she believed leaving the European Union is a “suicide mission” that will take Britain “over a cliff”, revealing she defected because the Lib Dems “have the only sensible plan in place”. \nBoth the columnist and her younger brother Jo Johnson, the universities minister, supported the remain campaign in the July referendum. \nWriting in the Mail on Sunday, Ms Johnson said her eldest sibling “made it quite clear he thought I’d lost my last remaining marble” when she confessed she was now a paid-up member of the opposition. \nExplaining her decision, she wrote: “ \nAs I say to my brother every time I see him - and he would, I hope, admit I’ve been consistent if not loyal on this - the reason I’ve gone as far as to join an opposition party is because the goods the Brexiteers showed us in the referendum bill of sale have so far turned out to be faulty.” \nMs Johnson highlighted how, after assurances by US officials that Britain would be “front of the queue” for a trade deal, Britain is now “behind the EU”. \nShe said the promise of £350 million in funding for the NHS, which emblazoned her brother’s Brexit bus, is no more, migration will have to remain at current levels in order for the country to thrive, and growth is slowing. 09:21 Good morning \nGood morning and welcome to our live coverage of the day’s politics news. \nPrime Minister Theresa May is due on the Andrew Marr show this morning (currently on BBC1), followed by Robert Peston’s show (on ITV1 from 10am). \nIf you want to get in touch with your thoughts, please do! \nHere are my contact details:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-04-30T16:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-04-30T11:32:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
