In her motion she said: \"Leaving the EU puts at risk all of these protections and the government has not yet promised to retain the level of protections that exist under EU legislation.\" \nPeter Burgess, from Devon Wildlife Trust, said: \"The council has made a momentous decision to be the first in the country to fully recognise the crucial role that EU directives have played. \n\"Special protection is needed to ensure our best wildlife sites get even better: from the hundreds of thousands of birds which flock to the Exe Estuary; the most southerly breeding dunlin in the world on Dartmoor; to the Culm grasslands which are home to clouds of marsh fritillary butterflies, one of the top ten most threatened species in Europe. \n\"Millions of people visit these landscapes each year and many livelihoods depend on their natural riches.\" \nMartin Harper, RSPB director of global conservation, said: \"In Devon the nature directives protect special sites covering 38,614 hectares on land, and 48,257 hectares of the seas off the Devon Coast. \n\"These include the blanket bogs, heaths and oak woodlands of Dartmoor, the cliffs along the Tintagel Coast; the rich mudflats, grazing marshes, sand flats and dunes of the Exe Estuary; and Dawlish Warren's otters, greater horseshoe bats and avocets.\" \nBEHIND THE STORY: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-04-28T23:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-04-28T20:32:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
