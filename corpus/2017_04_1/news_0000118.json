Prime Minster Theresa May gives a short speech and Q&A at GSK on April 21, 2017 in Maidenhead (Photo: PA) \nIf May faced the same kind of scrutiny and was judged in the media on what her government had actually achieved and not what favours she can bestow upon newspaper proprietors I think the poll ratings would be significantly different. \nWhen she called a snap election it flew in the face of numerous promises she had made since she became PM not to. \nWhen Corbyn chose not to challenge her and instead back an early election it was described by some as ‘political suicide’ as he could not win. \nHow cynical we have become. Forget having the courage of your convictions, only act if you believe you are 100% sure of winning. \nWell, here’s the thing.

And no wonder, looking at who holds the top jobs in her administration. \nYou have a Chancellor, Philip Hammond, who doesn’t even know his own party’s manifesto commitments and a Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, who wanders the world stage in this country’s name like Coco the clown. Read More How quietly, almost invisibly, the authorities are working to keep us safe \nAnd then there’s David Davis who has been in charge of Brexit negotiations since last year and who admitted only last month he hasn’t got a clue what the possible impact of Brexit on the country will be as he hasn’t looked into it. \nThe Tories claim that Corbyn is unfit to run the country.
