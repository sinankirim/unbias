But North Durham MP Kevan Jones , a former Labour defence minister, said the Government had shown “incompetence” by failing to mention Gibraltar’s right to stay British in Prime Minister Theresa May’s letter to the EU triggering Article 50. \nHe was speaking after former Conservative leader Michael Howard compared the dispute with Spain over Gibraltar to the dispute with Argentina over the Falklands , which led to the 1982 Falklands conflict in which 907 died. \nMr Jones insisted: “That was said just to divert attention from the real issue, which is why the Government has dropped this clanger by not including Gibraltar in the negotiations.” \nMrs May was forced to respond to Lord Howard’s comments by insisting there would be no war with Spain.
