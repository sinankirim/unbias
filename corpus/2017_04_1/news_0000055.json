Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA future Labour government could negotiate a new trade deal with the EU to protect businesses such as Nissan , Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has revealed. \nSpeaking to the Chronicle, Mr Corbyn said Nissan needed a tariff-free deal to allow it to export cars for sale in EU countries and to buy parts from EU suppliers. \nAnd if the Government took the UK out of the EU without such a deal, Labour would re-open negotiations. \nThe carmaker, which has a major plant in Sunderland, has warned that it could lose £500 million a year if it has to pay tariffs. \nPrime Minister Theresa May has warned that “no deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain”, raising the prospect of the UK leaving the EU without a trade deal. This would mean falling back on World Trade Organisation rules, which are likely to mean tariffs of 10% on vehicles made in the UK and exported to EU countries.
