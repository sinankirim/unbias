Distraction from the urgent priorities of seeking the best EU deal and improving UK productivity must be kept to a minimum. Carolyn Fairbairn \n“Firms will want to hear commitments from all parties to work in close partnership with business and back a new Industrial Strategy to make the UK economy the most competitive in the world by 2030. \n“It is essential to get the UK’s foundations right, from building a skills base for the next generation, to investing in infrastructure, energy and delivering a pro-enterprise tax environment.

The last year has been one of considerable uncertainty which, if it had gone on unchecked, would have risked hampering future investment. \n“We have significant negotiations to undertake with our partners in the rest of Europe and, doing this with a fresh and stable mandate from the country can only provide greater certainty about the future direction of travel for policy, and the potential to seek the best deal possible for the UK.” Jonathan Walker, of the North East England Chamber of Commerce \nIn the North East, Jonathan Walker, head of policy and campaign at the North East England Chamber of Commerce, said it was now up to politicians of all parties to demonstrate how they could help firms in this region. \n“There will be a huge amount of speculation about the PMs motivation for calling for a general election,” he said. \n“Whatever the reasoning, the onus is on all parties to demonstrate how they will deliver fair economic growth for businesses in the North East and help the UK secure the best possible Brexit deal.” \nMike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the election would “offer the opportunity for small business issues to be discussed by all political parties.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-04-18T21:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-04-18T17:10:10.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
