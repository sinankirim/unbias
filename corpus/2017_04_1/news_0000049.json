Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nDavid Cameron’s Government has been blasted in a Westminster report for the way it failed to plan for a Leave vote in the Brexit referendum. \nWestminster’s Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs has published a report, ‘Lessons Learned from the EU Referendum’, which examines the events which led up to the June 2016 vote , where the British electorate backed a campaign to Leave the European Union by 52-48% \nThe report says the result “destroyed” then Prime Minister David Cameron ’s credibility, and argues the Government - which spent £9.3m on pro-Remain leaflets - did not plan for the result. \nIt is the first UK-wide referendum where the electorate voted against the Government’s advice. \nPolitical journalist David Williamson has gone through the report for our colleagues at Wales Online , and picked out seven key points.

The Government should have prepared for a vote for Brexit \nThe MPs insist the Government had a “constitutional and public obligation to prepare for both outcomes from the referendum”. \nThey argue that civil servants should “never have been asked to operate in a climate where contingency planning was formally proscribed by the Government”. \nToday’s report recommends that in future referendums “civil servants should be tasked with preparing for both possible outcomes”.

The Prime Minister should take responsibility rather than resigning if a referendum is lost \nDavid Cameron resigned in the wake of the referendum result but the MPs state: “The presumption should be that the sitting Prime Minister and his/her administration will continue in office and take responsibility for the referendum result in either eventuality.” The Government's £9.3m Remain leaflet (Photo: PA) 3. The £9.3m pro-EU leaflet and the Treasury reports were a mistake \nThere was intense controversy surrounding a leaflet sent to homes across the UK that made the case for staying in the EU, and Treasury forecasts outlining what could go wrong if the country backed Brexit also attracted criticism. \nThe MPs write: “The manner of the presentation of government reports, particularly those from the Treasury, and the decision to spend £9.3m on sending a leaflet, advocating a Remain vote, to all UK households, were inappropriate and counterproductive for the Government.” \nThey note that “polling undertaken by the Electoral Reform Society (ERS) indicated that the level of importance voters attached to the Government as a source of information fell from 10% to 8%, following the leaflet’s publication”. \nWarning of the danger to reputations, they state: “During the run-up to the EU referendum, there were many occasions when it appeared to many that civil servants were being drawn into referendum controversy. This damaged the reputations of the Civil and Diplomatic Services for impartiality.” Dawn breaks over the Houses of Parliament (Photo: 2016 Getty Images) 4. The UK Government and the civil service lost public trust \nThe MPs were alarmed at how the Government used Whitehall resources to make the case for staying in the EU. \nThey write: “While it is perfectly legitimate for the Prime Minister and government to take an official position during a referendum campaign, the fairness, and legitimacy, of a referendum rests on a careful and restrained use of the machinery of government. Unfortunately, many of the Government’s actions in the run-up to the referendum appear to have increased public distrust... \n“[The] use of the machinery of government during the referendum contributed to a perception that the civil service were, in some way, biased. That any such perception exists is deeply regrettable and was entirely avoidable. \n“We recommend that the Government heed the lessons from this referendum of the implications of the use of the machinery of government during referendums on public trust and confidence in the institutions of government.” EU Referendum votes are counted (Photo: Newcastle Chronicle) 5. The referendum was an attempt to shut down debate \nThe committee argues this was a “bluff call” referendum, stating: “The UK Government initiated the process which led to the referendum, despite being against the suggested proposal, and with the aim of using a negative result to shut down the debate about the question at issue.” Hacker looking at a computer screen (Photo: Caroline Purser) 6. There may have been ‘foreign interference’ \nThe MPs criticise the Government for the Register to Vote site crashing. \nThey say: “The Government has stated that this was due to an exceptional surge in demand, partly due to confusion as to whether individuals needed to register to vote... However, the Government clearly failed to undertake the necessary level of testing and precautions required to mitigate against any such surge in applications.” \nRaising the possibility of foul play, they write: “We do not rule out the possibility that there was foreign interference in the EU referendum caused by a DDOS (distributed denial of service attack) using botnets, though we do not believe that any such interference had any material effect on the outcome of the EU referendum.” Read More A worker sweeps the street outside 10 Downing Street, London (Photo: Anthony Devlin/PA Wire) 7. Despite the problems, the referendum was ‘momentous'' \nThe committee states: “The result was momentous: the victory for Leave – by a margin of 51.89% to 48.11%, representing 17.4 million votes to 16.14 million – was the first State-wide referendum in which the electorate rejected the advice of the Government.” Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-04-12T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-04-12T15:40:42.269+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
