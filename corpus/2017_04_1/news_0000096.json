Dr Cott is also a city councillor and the group’s ‘lead’ on children’s services. \nBill Shepherd, chairman of the Lib Dems’ City Party, said: “We have a powerful and experienced team to offer the people of Newcastle on June 8. \n“Newcastle voted REMAIN in the referendum – in no small part thanks to the efforts of Liberal Democrats in the council seats they hold. \n“We believe that people must be offered the final say on any deal the Tories negotiate for Brexit, and that’s the message we’ll all be taking to the streets and doorsteps over the next seven weeks.” \nIn a joint statement, the three candidates said: “ Theresa May has called a General Election out of opportunism and intolerance: Opportunism in seeking to exploit the weakness of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership of the Labour party; and intolerance in seeking a landslide majority to bring about ‘unity’ by which she means the ability to impose whatever interpretation of Brexit she wishes without meaningful scrutiny from Parliament. \n“Meanwhile, her Brexit-obsessed Government is failing to provide the decent schools, hospitals and social care which communities in the great city of Newcastle deserve. \n“This General Election once again places the interests of the Conservative Party ahead of the daily needs of the British people. \n“We are standing as Liberal Democrat Parliamentary Candidates in Newcastle, where we live and work, because we vehemently oppose the direction that Theresa May wishes to drag our wonderful country. \n“Our key task is to provide effective opposition and lead the fight against the Conservatives’ damaging approach to Brexit. \n“Newcastle residents deserve a better choice than Theresa May’s hard Brexit and Jeremy Corbyn’s hapless leadership.” \nAt the 2015 General Election all three seats were won by Labour - Catherine McKinnell in Newcastle North, Chi Onwurah in Newcastle Central and Nick Brown in Newcastle East.
